Social audit.\n\n“ Examine why it is that you failed to uncover or why you .gnored the hazards at\nthe factory in Savar, which were in -iolation of Banglace.h's inadequate labour\nlaw and against international labour standards as wel' as your own code of\nconduct covering wages and workiag conditions includiig hours of work and\nhealth and safety. In particular, | would urge you to disclose your company’s\naudil reports for this company.\n\n* Take urgent measures to examine what measures are nic esvary to ensure your\ncode of conduct is properly implemealted throughout your upply chain.\n\n1.1. First of all, as revealed by the information provided in our 2002 and 2003\nSustainability Reports, we hereby confirm the follow 1.g:\n\n- That INDITEX is a textile company that manufix tures over 60% of its\nproducts in European markets.\n\n- That the implantation strategy regarding the Code of Conduct for\nExternal Manufacturers anc Workshops, approved in February 2001\nfocused during FY2002 and 2003 in carrying ow: a first phase of social\naudits in Europe, Turkey, Morocco, Peru and Breutil.\n\n- That, further to the completion of the foregoing phase, and with the\nexperience gained, INDITEXX began in October 21104 the social audit in\n900 factories and traders which make up th: portfolio of Asian\nmanufacturers currently in process.\n\nRustre Murcandll ue & Cavudtie, Tine 9641 v1 | An\n\nhey 4 Heyer mumerac, dd CFL k LOCO\n\n\nINDITEX\n\n- That the audit of Asian manufacturers, carried out in accordance with\nthe BSCI methodology and by SAI-certified auditors, is still in progress\nand ig expected to be completed by May end.\n\n- Last, that, once the abovementioned audit be conrleted, a concentration\nand future normalization process will begin wtich will result in the\nbeginning of corrective action plans in the factcries of the INDITEX\nsuppliers in Asia.\n\n1.2. Conclusion:\n\n- Although the factories of the suppliers in Bangla:k sh were being audited\nwhen the catastrophe occurred, Spectrum wes not included in the\nreview-normalization process for two reasons: first, the contractual\nmanufacture relationship had taken place thoug)i 1 trader in India, and;\nsecondly, the supplier did net provided the name of its subcontracts. As\na result of the above, Spectrum was not included in the scope of the\nreview.\n\n2. Solidarity Fund\n\nEnsure that the survivors as well as the families of those that ded receive exemplary\ncompensation, as well as the payment of any outstanding waces or henefits. If the\nmanufacturer does not do so, then the branas or retailers sourci» \\ ar the factory should\ntake joint responsibility.\n\nWith regard to this issue we would like to point out:\n\n2.1. That from the very moment the CSR [-epartment became ¢. arc of the catastrophe\nand bearing in mind that the review process was under we, it got in touch with\nCruz Roja Internacional in Spain to be of any assistance thet might be required.\n\n2.2. That, once informed by Clean Clothes Campaign that wher the catastrophe took\nplace several garments of the ZARA brand were being maxufactured, an internal\nenquiry was immediately ordered which confirmed that d wring FY 2003-2004,\napproximately 84,000 units had been nanufactured throuzh the abovementioned\ntrader.\n\n2.3.

That INDITEX promoted the creation of a Task Force beaded by BSCI and\ncomprised of BSCI representatives, lozal unions, local and international NGO's,\nlocal governments and manufacturers.\n\n2.7. That INDITEX invited some of your representatives (M23srs. Mountadas and\nBoix, from CC.OO (Spain), to take part in said Task Force.\n\n\nIMNDITEX\n\n2.8. Last, that the aims targeted by the abovementioned Task force in Dacca to take\nplace in the next few weeks, were, inter alia:\n\n- To carry out a professional and independent engtury in order to clarify\nthe reasons of this catastropbe and to help allocate responsibilitics.\n\n- To carry out a technical and independent reseaich in order to identify\nand asscss the human damages caused by (2 catastrophe to the\nemployees and the families of the deceased, ir. terms of “solidarity”\ninstead of “compensation”.\n\n- Last, to set up a protocol of intervention for fuluwe catastrophes jointly\nwith all those involved in the process.\n\n3. List of suppliers\n\nDisclose full details of your supply chain so that trade unions and others in civil Society\ncan ensure that minimum conditions arz being met. Nikz the world's largest\nSportswear company, released the full list of its suppliers a couple of weeks ago, and\nthere is no reason whatsoever why all othe brand names and ;vtalers should not do\nthe same. Retailers or brands which refuse to do can only be iidged to be afraid of\nbeing exposed as agents of exploitation.\n\n3.1, As we have already stated under paragraphs 1.1. and 1.2. arove, we are presently\ncompleting the first phases of the normalization process regurding the factories of\nthe suppliers of INDITEX worldwide Once this process ii completed, we will\nconsider your proposal.\n\nLast, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the :nterest shown in the\norganization that J am honoured to head and offer you my support to develop jointly\nwith some corporations, trade unions and the civil society, production lines that fully\nobserve and ensure the Basic Human and Working Rights.\n\nShould you require any additional information on the evolution of the Task Force in\nDacca or on any other issues regarding the implantation of our ‘Code of Conduct for\nExternal Manufacturers and Workshops, please contact either riyself or Mr. Javier\nChércoles ~ the Director of the CSR Department at INDITEX.\n\nBest regards\n\nhe Ww\nie NC\n\nDeputy Chairman and CEO"}

We believe that through innovation, investments and partnerships, global agriculture can grow to continue meeting needs for food, feed, fuel and fiber. With its vast global sourcing, transportation and processing network, ADM is efficiently connecting supply and demand every single day. This helps buffer the impact of regional shortages that can lead to price volatility and acute hunger issues. ADM also supports efforts to help smallholder farmers in the developing world grow and preserve more of their own food to help protect them and their communities from price shocks. We’re increasing our presence in key crop-growing regions, helping to connect more farmers to global markets, improving farmers’ livelihoods and enhancing the global supply of crops."}

Hereby we answer the questions raised in your \nletter as follows: \n\n1.    A Brief Introduction of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project \n\nRegarding the basic situation of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project, the company \n\nhas made multiple explanations on different occasions and during our exchanges with the local \nmedia in the past.    We are willing to make a brief explanation here again.    The starting point of the \nMyanmar-China crude oil pipeline is located on Madae Island, while that of the Myanmar-China gas \npipeline is located in Kyaukpyu.    The pipeline then goes via Rakhine State, Camaguey Province, \nMandalay Province, and Shan State, and enters China via Ruili.    The total length of the crude oil \npipeline is 771 kilometres, while that of the natural gas pipeline is 793 kilometres.    As agreed \nbilaterally between Myanmar and China, upon completion and commission of the Myanmar-China \noil and gas pipeline, 2 million tons of crude oil and 2 billion cubic metres of natural gas will be loaded \nin Myanmar each year, which could be used to promote the economic development and to improve \nthe living standards of people in Myanmar.    This will actively help solve the energy needs of \nMyanmar.    The Natural Gas Pipeline loading points are located in Kyaukpyu, Yenangyaung, \nTaungtha and Mandalay.   \n\nThe Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline Project is jointly invested by six parties from four countries: \n\nChinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), Daewoo Group of South Korea, OCEBV from \nIndia, Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) and Gas \nAuthority of India Limited (GAIL).    The parties founded Southeast Asia Gas Pipeline Company \n(SEAGP) by each making an investment; SEAGP is responsible for building and operating the \nMyanmar-China gas pipeline.    The natural gas in the Myanmar-China gas pipeline comes from \n\"The Shwe Gas Project\", which is a gas field developed by Daewoo International Ltd. of South \nKorea. \n\nThe Myanmar-China gas pipeline commissioning ceremony was held in Mandalay on 28 July \n\n \n \n \n \n\f2013.    The Myanmar vice president Nyan Tun pointed out in his speech in the commissioning \nceremony, that he believes through this pipeline, Myanmar's economy, industrialisation and \nelectrification will be carried to a higher level.    \"I am particularly grateful for the protection of the \nnatural environment at the construction site and along the pipeline regions, and the loving care given \nto the local people in the construction process of the project.    I hope that the loving care will \ncontinue in Myanmar like the life of the pipeline project.\" \n\n2.    Clarifications on Certain Issues \n\n1. The Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project is built fully in accordance with \n\ninternational standards. \n\nThe Project mainly followed the API and ASME standards.    API (American Petroleum Institute) \nis one of the earliest and most successful worldwide trade associations that develop standards.    It \nis primarily responsible for standardisation of industrial oil and gas equipment.    ASME (American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers) mainly develops and publishes norms and standards for the \nmachinery manufacturing industry.    These are now widely recognised technical standards in the \ninternational petroleum industry.   \n\nIn accordance with API standard, the steel pipe used in the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline \n\nProject is X70 carbon steel pipe which is resistant to high pressure and high temperature \ndifferentials.    The exterior of the steel pipe is covered by corrosion-resistant layers and cathodic \nprotection materials to protect the steel pipe from corrosion.    The damage shown in the photo of the \nreport is actually damage of the corrosion resistant layer, not that of the steel pipe.   \n\nBeginning at the pipeline’s commissioning, to ensure safe and reliable operation of the oil & gas \n\npipeline, the company has used SCADA monitoring and data acquisition systems for 24-hour \nmonitoring of the pipeline's operation status.    With these systems in place, we can master real-time \noperation status of the pipeline, and ensure its safety.   \n\n3PE Protective Layers \n\nPE Layer \n\nAdhesive Layer \n\nEpoxy Layer \n\nWorking Pipe \n\nSteel pipe corrosion-resistant treatment              Structure of the pipeline corrosion-resistant layer   \n\n2. Land Acquisition and Compensation Principles of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas \n\nPipeline Project. \n\nTo do a good job of land acquisition from villagers along the pipeline, the Myanmar Ministry of \n\nEnergy (MOE), MOGE, SEAGP and Southeast Asia Crude Oil Pipeline (SEAOP) jointly established \nan acquisition working group, which is directly responsible for the pipeline project's land acquisition \nand compensation work.    The relevant regional governments' land departments at different levels \nwhere the pipeline passes by are also directly involved in land acquisition compensation work, \nparticipating in the measurement of range of land expropriated, negotiation of the compensation \nstandard, and so on.   \n\nThe land acquisition and compensation for the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project \nalways follow the principles as below: the land acquisition and compensation work shall at all times \nbe in accordance with the laws and regulations of Myanmar; land acquisition along the pipeline shall \nnot take villagers' arable land, or take as little arable land as possible; in case of temples, Buddhist \nPagodas, schools, cemeteries, natural protected areas and heritage, the pipeline shall resolutely \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\favoid them by diverting; acquisition of villagers' land is based on the voluntary principle - in case \ncertain villagers do not agree with the land acquisition, the pipeline shall bypass their land by \nchanging its route; the principle of \"compensate villagers first, and then use the land\" is followed; the \ncompensation payments are made directly to the villagers.   \n\nThe land acquisition for the pipeline project that CNPC is involved in strictly followed the \nrelevant laws and regulations of Myanmar.    The land acquisition process was clear, precise and \nnormalised.    The finalisation of the compensation standards for land acquisition followed strict \nprocedures, and was approved by government departments at multiple levels.    The level of land \ncompensation is set based on factors like the location, land type, type of crop, yield, maturity, market \nvalue of annual harvest etc.    Simple comparison of its level as too high or too low is not appropriate.   \nStandard procedures are in place for calculation of compensation.    Land compensation work is \nalways carried out in an open, transparent, and legitimate manner.    All the land compensation \npayments are received by the land owners personally, while the signing of the land compensation \nagreement is also open to the public.   \n\nA villager of [Xingai], Mandalay \nsigning a land compensation \nagreement \n\nA [Duoma] villager signing a land \ncompensation agreement \n\nAccording to the old Land Administration Law, land compensation standards include crop \ncompensation: the crop compensation term for permanent land acquisition is five years, while that \nfor temporary land acquisition is three years.    After the new Land Administration Law of Myanmar \nwas promulgated at the end of 2012, the provisions required that for permanent land acquisition, \nonly three years' fee of crop compensation need to be paid.    After the new law was promulgated, \nthe company still compensated land owners who had not finished the land acquisition process at \nthat time according to the five-year crop compensation standard for permanent land acquisition.   \nAccording to the land compensation procedures, the land compensation payment is handed directly \nto the villagers in cash (Kyats) by holding land compensation ceremonies.    No third party is used for \ntransfer of the compensation.   \n\nLand Compensation Ceremony \n\nRegarding the land compensation standards, the relevant responsible official from the Ministry \nof Energy of Myanmar has introduced and commented on the \"Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline \nProject Land Compensation Standard\" in many meetings and other public occasions.    The \nresponsible official used data comparison and analysis, and said that even compared to the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAmerican standard, the Myanmar-China pipeline project's land compensation standard is rather high \n(for detailed information of the news, please refer to media reports in November 2012; you can also \nseek further evidence about this from the relevant government department).   \n\nAll in all, the land acquisition of the pipeline project was carried out in strict observance of \n\nrelated laws and regulations of Myanmar.    The acquisition process was clear, precise and \nnormalised.    The finalisation of the compensation standard for land acquisition followed strict \nprocedures, and was approved by government departments at multiple levels.    The level of land \ncompensation is set based on factors like the location, land type, type of crop, yield, maturity, market \nvalue of annual harvest etc.    Simple comparison of its level as too high or too low is not appropriate.   \nStandard procedures are in place for calculation of compensation.    Land Compensation work is \nalways carried out in an open, transparent, and legitimate manner.    All the land compensation \npayments are received by the land owners personally, while the signing of the land compensation \nagreement is also open to the public.   \n\n3. CNPC attaches great importance to environmental protection in the Myanmar-China \n\nPipeline Project. \n\nThe long-distance pipeline project is a non-polluting ecological project, with no emissions, no \ndischarge of polluted water or any other discharge of pollutants.    It has the surest guarantee on the \nenvironment and safety.    The pipeline project will make no impact on the groundwater of residents \nalong the pipeline.     \n\nTo perform the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the pipeline project impartially, EIA \n(including SIA - Social Impact Assessment) of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project was \ncarried out by the Thailand-based company IEM through an international tender, in accordance with \nthe World Bank's Guidelines and Equator Principles' norms and standards.    The company strictly \nfollowed international principles, and submitted a report to the responsible authorities of the \nMyanmar government.   \n\nBoth the design and construction of the Myanmar-China pipeline and crude oil terminal project \n\nhave adopted high international engineering standards, with a strict monitoring and prevention \nsolution in place in their operations management, which includes strict engineering design \nstandards, totally enclosed delivery technology, strict engineering quality control, effective \nenvironmental protection measures, and high-standard engineering measures for seismic restraint \nand typhoon restraint, multiple protections for fire safety, as well as 24-hour real-time monitoring, \nstandardised and normalised work procedures, professional equipment service and maintenance, \nand effective emergency treatment and harm reduction measures.    The intrinsically safe project, \ncoupled with the strictly normalised operational management and protective measures all guarantee \nsafe operation.   \n\nThere are placards and warning signs at the construction sites to remind staffto protect the \nenvironment \n\n \n \n\fThe Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project has strict measures for sewage \ntreatment in place.    Firstly, for sewage produced in daily life both by the construction sites and \nmanagement offices, each camp has built-in sewage treatment facilities.    After treatment, the \ndischarge is in compliance with international environmental requirements.    Secondly, here are \nseparate arrangements for household waste and solid waste. : Waste disposal agreements are \nsigned with local sanitation departments, who will recycle and dispose of the waste.   \n\nWaste Classification and Disposal   \n\nCNPC has always attached great importance to protection work of historical and cultural \n\nheritage and flora and fauna protection areas.    At the initial stage of the construction of the pipeline \n- early exploration of the line and piping design stage - the pipeline was always designed to bypass \nor avoid all Myanmar monuments, temples, flora and fauna protection areas, etc. that it might pass \nthrough.    During the construction of the pipeline, the company and its contractors actively provided \nhelp to temples along the pipeline within its means, for example installing flush toilets for a monks’ \ntemple on Madae Island; donating money and goods to temples and orphanages, and so on.   \nThese good deeds are appreciated and welcomed by both the Buddhist monks and laypeople.   \n\n   \n \n\fGave 21 piglets to local villagers of Made Kyun on 14 \nNov2011 \n\nOn 8 Dec2011, to improve the living environment of the \nisland, and to improve the living conditions of the residents, \nwe bought 3,000 pcs baby fish for local residents and released \nthem so that residents can fully make use of the newly built \nreservoir resources. \n\nOn Jan 08, 2012, we donated a flush toilet to the temple on \nthe island so that it is more convenient for the monks to use. \n\nOn 5 Mar2011, went to visit 49 seniors with no family and \nbrought quilts and oil etc. to spread the caring love from \nChinese people to these elderly people. \n\nThe management of the company donated more than 26,920 \nRMB for children on Madae Island, who are too poor to go \nto school. Our slogan was: “Reach out with love” \n\nWith commissioning of the tap water project we built for the \nMadae Island villagers, they can now celebrate their \nWater-Splashing Festival with joy. \n\n \n\fRegarding the impacts the pipeline might have on the soil - people of the Hsipaw region are \n\nconcerned that the salt underground might corrode the pipeline.    We can say in a responsible \nmanner that during the pipeline exploration, we have already researched the various soil conditions \nto learn about the soil environment along the pipeline so that we can prevent corrosion of the \npipeline by the soil - solutions are implemented accordingly.    For the construction of the pipeline, it \ndoes not pass through local salt mines - the pipeline either bypasses or avoids local salt mine areas.   \nAnd in accordance with regulations, the pipeline is protected with corrosion resistance technologies \nin accordance with international standards: the pipeline has protective measures like 3 layers of PE \ncorrosion resistance layers, cathodic protection technology, and so on.   \n\nWe understand the concerns of the Northern Shan Farmers' Committee about pipeline safety, \n\nland compensation and impact of the pipeline on the environment; we feel also perturbed by the \nmisunderstandings caused by local people's lack of knowledge of the pipeline.    As a responsible \ncompany, we are committed to implementing the project in accordance with international standards \nand norms.    The land compensation also has a set of standard procedures in place.    While having \ncarried out the required environmental impact assessment before the construction of the project, we \nalso attach extreme importance to the protection of the environment in the building process.    We \nhope that by publicly clarifying and publishing this information, the misunderstanding of local people \ncan be eliminated.    What is more, we hope that through our project, we can bring a real sense of \nwell-being to the local people.   \n\nWe welcome media from all walks of life in Myanmar to report on the Myanmar-China pipeline \nproject, so public opinion can supervise each aspect of the project.    Meanwhile, we also call upon \nrelevant organizations to let the facts speak for themselves, and to make objective assessments and \npublications about the Myanmar-China pipeline."}

We take the allegations in the report very seriously. We have \nconducted our own initial investigation and believe there are a number of inconsistencies and \ninaccuracies in the report. We have shared the NLC’s report with Chi Fung’s owners and we \nwill continue our internal investigation. If our internal investigation finds non-compliances, we \nwill  immediately  work  with  the  factory  to  remediate  the  problems,  facilitate  the  engagement \nwith  relevant  stakeholders  and  commission  independent  third  parties  to  verify  that  the \nremediation has been effective. \n\nThe  adidas  Group  has  a  dedicated  team  of  more  than  60  Social  and  Environmental  Affairs \n(SEA) members, including highly qualified labour and health and safety experts, who regularly \nmonitor  our  global  supply  chain.  Through  our  work  we  ensure  that  factories  making  our \nproducts consistently deliver fair, safe and healthy working conditions. We have worked with \nChi Fung for more than 10 years. During this time, we have regularly monitored and reviewed \nChi  Fung’s  payroll  records  and  have  not  found  the  serious  overtime  compensation  issues \nalleged  in  this  report.  Likewise  the  same  results  when  reviewing  the  working  hour  and  work \nscheduling records. SEA has been aware of cameras and monitors in the factory and spoke \nwith  the  owners  more  than  a  year  ago.  The  system,  used  to  quickly  resolve  production  and \nmechanical issues on the floor, was turned off and has not been used. Bathrooms are clean, \nserviceable  and  in  good  working  order. SEA  monitors  the  relationships  between  Chi  Fung \nis  a  company  harassment  policy \nsupervisors  and  production  workers,  and \ncommunicated to all employees.  \n\nthere \n\nOur  suppliers  are  also  subject  to  an  additional  level  of  oversight. In  Chi  Fungs’s  case,  there \nhave been independent third-party audits by Fair Labor Association (FLA) monitors. The FLA \ncombines  the  efforts  of  industry,  civil  society  organisations  and  colleges  and  universities  to \nprotect  workers’  rights,  improve  working  conditions  worldwide  and  promote  adherence  to \ninternational  labour  standards. In  addition,  Chi  Fung  has  been  audited  and  certified  by  the \nWorld Wide Responsible Apparel Production (WRAP) certification programme. \n\nWhenever we have identified employment, health and safety non-compliance issues, Chi Fung \nhas  worked  with  us,  the  Fair  Labor  Association,  other  customers,  members  of  local  civil \nsociety,  and  El  Salvador’s  regulatory  agencies  to  promptly  remediate  any  non-compliance. \nThe  remediation  process  includes  implementation  of  improved  policies  and  practices  for \nmanaging employment relationships."}

In keeping with our Guiding Principle of\n\"respect for people,\" our position with regards to supply chain management is to establish\nbusiness relations based on mutual trust and respect, open communications and cooperative\nproblem solving.\n\nThat said, we have strong policies in place, outlined in our CSR policy: Con fribution Towards\nSustainable Development, revised in August 2008, to insure that our company and our business\npartners and suppliers in each region adhere to our standards.\n\nFurthermore, in February 2009, we issued \"Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines,\" which have been\nshared with our tier one suppliers and are available online at:\nhttp://www.toyota.co.jp/en/csr/relationship/pdf/supplier.html\n\nBased on our Guiding Principles, these guidelines state the policies we expect our suppliers to\ncomply with in undertaking their activities, including:\n\n• Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of each country and region.\n• Non-discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics protected by local applicable\nlaws and regulations, such as race, ethnic and national origin, religion, age, gender, etc.\n\n• Non-tolerance of any form of harassment in the workplace based upon the personal\n\ncharacteristics protected by local applicable laws and regulations.\n\n• Non-tolerance for any use of child or forced labor.\n• Payment of wages in compliance with local applicable laws and regulations.\n• Compliance with local applicable laws and regulations governing employees' working\n\nhours.\n\n\f• Recognition of employees' right to freely associate, or not to associate, complying with\n\nlocal applicable laws and regulations.\nPlacing the highest priority on safety and health programs and policies in the workplace,\nso that employees are able to work without undue concerns, and strive to prevent\naccidents and injuries from happening in the workplace.\n\nToyota requests that suppliers implement CSR initiatives based on the Guidelines. Toyota also\nrequests that suppliers expand CSR initiatives with other business partners based on the\nGuidelines. Toyota will regularly request that suppliers self-check their activities in line with the\nGuidelines and make improvements where necessary.\n\nIn addition, Toyota plans to continue holding seminars on compliance for suppliers. Toyota\nviews suppliers as equal partners based on mutual trust. Therefore, if suppliers discover\nproblems during the course of their self-check, Toyota will encourage them to vigorously solve\nthe problem(s) independently through their own internal structure and systems. If asked, Toyota\nwill support its suppliers' efforts.\n\nFurthermore, in North America, we are actively engaged with the Automotive Industry Action\nGroup (AIAG), whose mission is to improve guidelines and productivity within the industry,\namong other goals. Specifically, we are collaborating with AIAG on the development of training\nmaterials and workshops on human rights and best practices for suppliers.\n\nAs a company committed to \"kaizen\" or continuous improvement, we realize that there is still\nmuch work to be done. We continue to engage our employees and stakeholders around the\nworld to help strengthen our commitment to CSR in every aspect of our business.\n\nThank you again for your continued interest in Toyota.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJames Wiseman\nGroup Vice President\nToyota Motor North America, Inc.\n\n2"}

El Derby 055, \nTorre 1, Of 902 \nSantiago de Surco \nLima - Perú \n\nThank  you  for  your  interest  in  our  Peruvian  operations  and  the  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  the article  Environmental Monitoring  of  Xstrata  Tintaya  Copper  Mine  in \nCusco, Peru by Eike Sophie Hümpel, EJOLT, 3 August 2012. \n\nXstrata  is  deeply  committed  to  the  principles  of  sustainable  development  and  our \norganisation in Peru is no exception. Our Tintaya operation conducts  comprehensive \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  all  community  participatory  and  company  monitoring \nactivities  to  date  have  demonstrated  that  Tintaya  operates  in  line  with  Peruvian  law \nand Xstrata’s industry-leading standards. \n\nTintaya  retains  and  recycles  all  process  water  on-site  and  we  do  not  discharge  into \nlocal  water  bodies.  We  do  not  produce  or  use  mercury,  arsenic  or  lead  in  our \nprocesses.  Upstream  and  downstream  monitoring  results  shows  that  water  quality  is \nconsistent  and there  is no  impact  from  our  mining  operations.  We  have  publicly  and \nrepeatedly  rejected  allegations  of  environmental  pollution  at  Tintaya  including  river \npollution. \n\nWith  respect  to  the  report  commissioned  by  Vicaria  de  la  Solidardid  which  analysed \nwater and soil samples from the region, it is important to note that the study did not \nfind  that  Tintaya  contaminated  local  land  or  water  sources.  It  found  that  Saldo  river \nwater  was  not  suitable  to  be  used  as  drinking  water.  Under  Peruvian  legislation  this \nuntreated, natural water is not considered to be potable water. \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  the  study’s  methodology  did  not  take  into  account  the \nhydrogeological characteristics of the Salado River which originates from hydrothermal \nsources and naturally contains heavy metals. In addition the study did not account for \nthe  geological  characteristics  of  the  area,  such  as  the  natural  background \nmineralisation  present  in  the  region  which  has  been  confirmed  by  previous \nparticipative  monitoring  processes  involving  local  and  international  non-government \norganisations.  The  mineralisation  described  by  Ms  Hümpel  in  her  article  is  not  only \npresent  in  the  Espinar  province  but  the  wider  Andean  mountain  region  as  found  by \nstudies  undertaken  by  the  Peruvian  Health  Ministry  and  Peruvian  Geological,  Mining \nand Metallurgy Institute (part of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe  Tintaya  mine  will  cease  operations  later  this  year.  Xstrata  has  invested  $1.47 \nbillion  to  develop  the  Antapaccay  deposit,  located  10  kilometres  from  the  Tintaya \nopen  pit,  which  will  extend  the  operation’s  life  by  at  least  20  years  and  provide \nongoing  socio-economic  benefits  for  the  people  of  Espinar  province  and  the  Cusco \nregion.  As part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the development of \nthe  Antapaccay  mine,  accredited  consultants  undertook  environmental  baseline \nstudies including water, soil and sediment characterisation studies. These studies and \ntheir  findings  confirmed  natural  background  mineralisation  in  the  area  and  the \npresence  of  metals  in  soil  and  water  sources.  The  studies  were  submitted  to  the \nPeruvian  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines,  Espinar  municipal  government  and  Cuzco \nregional government and the findings were disclosed to local communities and other \nstakeholders  through  workshops  and  public  hearings  as  part  of  the  EIA  regulatory \napproval process. \n\nFollowing the completion of mining activities at Tintaya, the main pit will be used as a \ntailings  storage  facility  for  the  new  Antapaccay  mine.  Extensive  engineering  and \nenvironmental  impact  studies  were  undertaken  by  international  experts  to  assess  the \nsafety and feasibility of this option. These studies considered, among other things, the \ngeochemical, hydrological and stability aspects of the tailings and pit and determined \nthis  method  of  tailings  storage  is  safe  and  will  significantly  reduce  Antapaccay’s \nenvironmental footprint. \n\nWe  are  pleased  that,  in  line  with  our  repeated  offers  to  initiate  further  participatory \nenvironmental monitoring, a number of new environmental monitoring processes were \nagreed in response to community concerns at a meeting in April 2012 held in Espinar \nby  representatives  of  national  government,  the  state’s  health  and  environmental \ninstitutions,  the  Espinar  provincial  municipality  and  local  civil  society  organisations. \nThese  activities,  including  participatory  monitoring  of  waterways  and  toxicological \nstudies of human and animal health, will be led by the relevant state regulatory bodies \nfor  health,  the  environment  and  agriculture.  We  welcome  these  initiatives  which  are \nscheduled to commence over the coming months and will cover the whole of Espinar \nProvince. \n\nWe  regularly  report  on  our  sustainability  performance  and  further  information, \nincluding  the  Xstrata  Copper  Southern  Peru  2011  sustainability  report,  is  available \nfrom the following link:  www.xstratacopper.com \n\nKind regards \n\nJosé Marún \nExecutive Vice President  \nSouth America Operations Division   \nXstrata Copper"}

Through our \npioneering wage strategy launched in 2013, we strongly support  wage increase that are set by a \ntripartite negotiation between workers, employers and governments, a view that is supported by the \nglobal trade unions and the ILO. Our motivation isn’t quick wins, but rather laying the groundwork \nfor lasting change. To get the best guidance developing our wage strategy, H&M formed an “Advisory \nBoard for Wage in H&M Supply Chain”. It consists of leading global experts from ILO, global trade \nunions, civil society and suppliers. They contributed with important perspectives on the wage issue. \nWe also invited different stakeholders to be part of forming our roadmap. We´ve meet with different \ncampaign organizations such as Clean Clothes Campaign, trade unions, NGOs and the Swedish \nGovernment to get their recommendations. \n\nOur wage strategy has annual targets in different areas, and one important milestone is that our \nmajor suppliers should have improved pay structures for fair living wages in place by 2018. We have \nthree role model factories, one in Cambodia and two in Bangladesh. Here we take the full capacity \nfor five years. The initiative came from a need to showcase that leadership in sustainability goes well \ntogether with good performance. In the role model factories we want to find best practice examples, \nboth within the environment and social area, which should set the standard for our other suppliers \nand the whole industry. During this fall we will have our first evaluation in the role model factory in \nCambodia and we already have a number of positive indications. The dialogue between factory \nmanagement and elected employee representatives has improved, and they hold regular meetings. \nWorking together, they have begun to create a new wage structure in the factory, with expertise and \nexperience being reflected in wage setting. The management has confirmed that they take a positive \nview of involving employee representatives, and that they can see how this will benefit both the \ntextile workers and the company in the long term. We are also involved in projects and programs \nwhich have the aim of strengthening employees’ rights and their ability to negotiate on their own \nbehalf on their terms and conditions through trade unions or other elected employee \nrepresentatives. In partnership with SIDA (The Swedish government), the ILO and IF Metall, we have \ninitiated a programme in Cambodia aimed at strengthening industrial relations in the textile industry \nand increasing the number of collective agreements. \n\nThis process takes time and raising wages in the textile industry is a shared responsibility involving a \nnumber of stakeholders. Our vision is that a fair living wage covering workers basic needs should be \npaid by all our commercial goods suppliers.  Our role as a buyer is not to set the level of wages. Our \napproach is that wages should be negotiated between the parties on the labour market. To promote \nsystemic change across the whole industry, and not just our suppliers, we continue to engage with \ngovernments, other brands and stakeholders. The governments need to strengthen the required \nlegal frameworks such as regular wage revisions and functioning industrial relations. H&M is in \nconstant dialogue with other brands and have sent a joint letter to the Cambodian government and \nGMAC to clarify the brands position in the upcoming wage negotiations. We have engaged in close \ndialogue with IndustryALL, who represent the affiliated Trade Unions on ground in Cambodia. We \nexpect factory workers to earn a fair living wage and this wage should be negotiated between the \nlegitimate labour parties. Overall we expect the installation of a regular industry collective bargaining \nprocess for wages which is fair and takes into account UN body ILO technical expertise  \nPlease see the letter here: http://about.hm.com/en/news/newsroom/news.html/en/joint-call-on-\nhigher-minimum-wage-in-cambodia.html"}

Total EP Nigeria has consequently set up a specific Land and Claims \ndepartment, the role of which specifically includes visiting communities and negotiating agreements \nwhen land is acquired, which occurs through fair contracts agreed by the parties. \n\n3/ As regards demonstrations: it should be noted that during a peaceful demonstration, one striking \nworker died from a heart attack. Individuals not involved in the demonstration attacked a soldier at \nthe same time and took his weapon from him. After this weapon was stolen, one person was killed. \n\n4/ As regards the Ibewa incident: the area affected by the eruptions which, contrary to what is \nalleged, did not result in explosions, is an uninhabited area with a few hundred square metres of \ncassava, and not several thousand. This area is used for the occasional hunting of wild game and to \npick fruit from a few scattered palm trees. At the time of the aforementioned eruption, as a \nprecautionary measure, access to the area was closed prohibited. The families and communities \naffected were duly compensated at the time for the inconvenience caused by this ban on accessing \nthe area for security reasons. Total subsequently bought the land in question and duly compensated \nthe communities affected. It is consequently wrong to claim that the communities were not \ncompensated. \n\n5/ As regards flaring: to be more accurate, flaring has required official permission since 1984. It is \nreiterated that our position on flaring is known and published in our 2013 CSR report. Our objective is \nconsequently to reduce flaring by 50%, excluding the start-up phase, between 2005 and 2014. Lastly, \nsince 2000, the Group has moreover decided to no longer undertake any new development that \nincludes continuous flaring beyond the start up-phase. The Group is also very active within the \n\"Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership“ led by the World Bank. \n\n6/ As regards the jobs created: the oil industry is not the largest provider of employment, and there \nare other industries that provide more. Total EP Nigeria however currently employs more than 100 \nmembers of the Egi community on a permanent basis, as well as more than a thousand locals under \nservice contracts (drivers, caterers, labourers, maintenance workers, security guards, etc.). \nTotal E&P Nigeria’s activities are in line with the Group’s code of conduct and are evaluated by \nqualified third parties.

Total EP Nigeria  a ainsi mis en place un département \ndédié « land and claims » dont l’une des missions est précisément de visiter les communautés \net de négocier les accords lorsqu’il y a acquisition de terrains, qui  font l’objet de contrats \néquitables agrées par les parties. \n\n3/Au sujet du bilan des manifestations : il est à noter que lors d’une manifestation pacifique, \nun ouvrier gréviste est décédé d’une crise cardiaque. Des personnes extérieures à la \nmanifestation  ont  attaqué dans le même temps un militaire et lui ont volé son arme. Suite à \nce vol d’armes,  une personne a été tuée. \n\n4/Au sujet de l’incident d’Ibewa : la zone concernée par les éruptions  qui, contrairement à ce \nqui est allégué, ne se sont pas soldées par des explosions est une zone inhabitée sur laquelle se \ntrouvent quelques ares de manioc, et non plusieurs hectares.  Cette zone est utilisée pour la \nchasse occasionnelle de gibier de brousse et pour la cueillette de fruits issus de  palmiers \nisolés. Au moment de l’éruption précitée, par mesure de précaution, l’accès à cette zone a été \nbarré. A ce moment, les familles et communautés concernées ont été dument dédommagées \nde l’absence de jouissance ( « inconvenience ») liée à cette interdiction d’accès pour raison de \nsécurité. Par la suite, Total a racheté le terrain concerné et a dument compensé les \ncommunautés concernées. Par conséquent, il est erroné de prétendre  que les communautés \nn’ont pas été indemnisées. \n\n5/Au sujet du torchage : pour être plus précis, depuis 1984, le torchage est soumis à une \nautorisation. Pour rappel, notre position sur le torchage est connue et publiée dans notre \nrapport CSR 2013. Ainsi, nous avons pour objectif de réduire de 50% celui-ci, hors phase de \ndémarrage, entre 2005 et 2014. Enfin, depuis 2000, le Groupe  a en outre décidé de ne plus \nentreprendre de nouveaux développements comprenant du torchage continu au-delà de la \nphase de démarrage. Le Groupe est également très actif au sein du « Global Gas Flaring \nReduction partnership» piloté par la Banque Mondiale. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\f6/Au sujet des emplois créés, le secteur du pétrole est moins pourvoyeur d’emploi que \nd’autres secteurs.  Total EP Nigeria emploie cependant actuellement plus de 100 membres de \nla communauté des Egi à titre permanent, ainsi que plus d’un millier de locaux au titre de \ncontrats de service (chauffeurs, alimentation, ouvriers, maintenance, sécurité, etc.). \n\nLes activités de Total E&P Nigéria sont en ligne avec le Code de conduite du Groupe et font \nl’objet de contrôles par des tiers qualifiés. L’organisation américaine à but non lucratif – CDA \n– a récemment effectué sur place une évaluation des impacts sociétaux du Groupe dans la \nrégion. Ce rapport est disponible en ligne sur le site de CDA. \n\n(http://www.cdacollaborative.org/publications/corporate-engagement/cep-case-studies/field-\nvisit-report-total-ep-nigeria-(tepng)/)"}

Through our investments in our assets and the long-term commitments we make \nto the countries in which we operate, we believe that our global presence and economic strength \ncontribute positively to socioeconomic development in our host countries. \n\nMany of the unsubstantiated comments made by Public Eye are general statements, with no \nreference to specific incidents, independent witnesses or research reports. Public Eye does not \nprovide any explanation as to how its opinion has been reached or research conducted. \n\nWe are a major investor in the developing world and we are proud of the difference that our presence \ncan make.  Of the 200,000 people who work for us, around 80,000 are based in Africa. Many of our \ninvestments are located in challenging locations with diverse organisational culture and complex \nlegacy issues. Communities in these areas often face restricted access to basic services such as \nsanitation, water, energy and infrastructure. We undertake and contribute to activities and \nprogrammes designed to improve the quality of life for the people in the communities that surround \nour operations.  \n\nIn 2013, we paid US$3.7 billion in royalties and taxes, and a further US$4.3 billion in wages to our \n200,000 employees and contractors. US$170 million was spent on social investment such as \nhealthcare and education. Throughout the world our assets contribute to the building and \nmaintenance of roads, water infrastructure and other service development projects for the long-term \nbenefit of the local communities. \n\nOur corporate sustainability framework balances social, environmental, ethical and commercial \ninterests at every level of our group. This framework is called Glencore Corporate Practice (GCP). We \ndesigned and implemented the GCP to be in line with internationally recognised, good practice, sector \nspecific standards and we continue to monitor its performance to ensure it is fit for purpose. Our Code \nof Conduct is an important part of the GCP and sets out our corporate values and provides clear \nguidance to our employees about how we do business.  \n\nWe hope this response will fully address the unfounded allegations that have been presented by \nPublic Eye as a ‘nomination’ for its 2015 awards. \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 1: Pollution and health risks relating to our Colombian coal assets \nThe Public Eye ‘nomination’ makes a general accusation of Glencore’s Colombian coal assets \ncausing pollution and being responsible for health risks in the communities in which we operate. In \nparticular, Public Eye references the Colombian Ministry of Environment’s request for three rural \ncommunities to be relocated.  \n\nOur approach to community engagement derives from our overall commitment to respecting human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. We are committed to the UN Universal Declaration on Human \nRights, and support the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In the course of our \nmining operations we may need to disturb land that is used by a local community. We seek to avoid \nresettlement, but when it is the only viable course of action we consult closely with the affected \npopulation and seek to obtain its broad-based support.  \n\nWe are working closely with the communities near our operations in Colombia. Earlier this year, we \nsigned the resettlement action plan with Plan Bonito, one of the communities we have been asked to \nresettle. The process with the remaining communities of Boqueron and El Hatillo is ongoing.  \n\nA robust Resettlement Governance Structure has been established and an independent organisation \nhas been engaged as the facilitator. Our approach is consistent with IFC Performance Standard 5: \nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement. In line with this Standard, the resettlement process is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ffollowing a commonly accepted timeline and any attempt to expedite the process would risk ignoring \ncommunity needs and threaten the consultation process.  \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 2: Anti-union attitude in Colombia \nThe Public Eye ‘nomination’ accuses Glencore of having an ‘anti-union’ attitude in Colombia – again \nthere is no reference to specific incidents or a reason given as to how this conclusion has been \nreached. \n\nWe are committed to upholding and protecting human rights, including recognising our employees’ \nright to unionise. We have maintained constructive dialogue with the trade unions in Colombia. \n\nProdeco respects the rights of freedom of association for all of its employees, which are rights that are \nembodied by the Colombian Constitution. \n\nAt Prodeco, there are two industry unions (Sintraenergética and Sintracarbón) and one base union \n(Sintraprodeco). Prodeco holds periodic meetings with the unions to discuss concerns and to clarify or \ncorrect any disagreement within the parties. When issues are raised, Prodeco respects the unions’ \nrights to resort to legal measures to settle differences – Colombian law supports the use of arbitration \nwhen differences persist. Prodeco also respects the unions’ right to present and negotiate collective \npetitions. \n\nProdeco has reached agreement with the unions over a number of labour agreements that are \ncurrently in effect. In 2013, Prodeco finalised a three year union agreement, which was negotiated in \njust 20 days. This was in contrast to other Colombian coal mining companies that experienced lengthy \nnegotiations that often ended in industrial action.  \n\nProdeco is aware that a number of union leaders in Colombia have received threats of violence. In \n2013, Prodeco received information regarding threats being made against the trade union leaders at \nits operations. Prodeco immediately reported this information to the authorities and provided \nprotection for the individuals concerned. \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 3: Legal proceedings for environmental pollution being brought in \nArgentina \nPublic Eye has made a general statement that there are several legal proceedings for environmental \npollution being brought against a mining company in Argentina in which Glencore has a 50% stake \n(Minera Alumbrera Ltd).  \n\nIn Argentina, we are the operators (through Minera Alumbrera) of the Bajo de la Alumbrera project, in \nwhich Goldcorp Inc and Yamana Gold also have interests. Yacimientos Mineros de Agua de Dionisio \n(YMAD), - a public entity in which the province of Catamarca, the National University of Tucumán and \nthe Argentine National State have an interest, - is the owner of the mining rights and has a \nparticipation in the benefits of the project.  As no particular legal case is named by Public Eye, our \nresponse to the accusations of environmental damage notes these cases: \n\n•  A claim that Minera Alumbrera contaminated a mineral spring on private property – to which \n\nMinera Alumbrera has demonstrated that no water was affected and that no damage was caused \nto the claimants; \n\n•  Two claims relating to alleged contamination caused by our filter plant discharge – in both \n\nincidents, expert witnesses have shown that Minera Alumbrera’s discharges met the applicable \nprovincial legal requirements.  In a third case, in response to evidence provided by an expert \nwitness that showed compliance with the applicable provincial legal requirements, the Judge, at \nthe request of the Federal Prosecutor, ordered the case to be closed; and \n\n•  Legal action resulting from alleged contamination from Minera Alumbrera’s tailing dam – the \nexpert witness, appointed by the Federal Judge, identified no environmental changes to the \nnatural conditions of the area and that the results for around 70 chemical substances were in line \nwith natural levels. \n\nFurther information on the approach that Minera Alumbrera takes and the importance it attaches to \noperating in an environmentally aware manner is available at: http://www.alumbrera.com.ar/ \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fUnsubstantiated allegation 4: Accusations of profiting from child labour in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo \nPublic Eye has accused Glencore of profiting from child labour at our assets in the Katanga province \nof the DRC. This is an allegation we have publicly refuted on numerous occasions. \n\nIn 2010, our concession at Tilwezembe was seized by illegal miners. We have been unable to access \nthis concession since its occupation without endangering the safety of our people. We are aware of \nconcerns that human rights abuses may be taking place at the concession and wholeheartedly \ncondemn any violations that may occur. At no time has neither Glencore nor any of its subsidiaries \nbenefited from or received material sourced from this deposit. We have requested assistance from the \ngovernment in resolving the matter, and remain in communication with the authorities to bring this \nissue to a satisfactory resolution.  \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 5: Tax avoidance by Glencore’s Zambian copper asset \nPublic Eye alleged that Glencore’s Zambian subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines, has avoided paying \nprofit tax. This is simply untrue and has been repeatedly denied by Glencore – the statements made \nby Glencore on this topic are available on our website. These allegations stem from an incomplete \nleaked draft report that has repeatedly been shown to be factually flawed. A complete report has \nnever been issued by the companies who drafted the report. \n\nSince acquisition of the assets the corporate shareholders have invested over $2.4 billion in capital \nprojects to redevelop and expand Mopani’s operations. These investments have secured the long-\nterm future of the business, doubling employment, increasing production and improving safety. \n\nTo date, Mopani has paid over US$800 million in taxes, royalties and other dues to Government since \nprivatisation. Mopani is audited every year by Deloitte and its accounts have always been given a \nclean bill of health. As a public company, Mopani’s accounts are lodged with Securities and Exchange \nCommission as well as the Companies Registry in Lusaka and are publicly available.  \n\nMopani was recently awarded the best reporting company in line with EITI standards for \ndemonstrating consistency and strict adherence to EITI reporting requirements. \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 6: general, non-incident specific allegation of failure to mitigate \nhuman rights and the environment impacts \nRespect for human rights is core to our approach to business. We are committed to the United \nNations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We support the UN Guiding Principles on Business \nand Human Rights as a framework for the responsibilities of governments and corporations to protect \nthe rights of individuals and groups and ensure that redress is available if any of these rights are \ninfringed. \n\nOur Group Human Rights Policy was developed in 2013 to strengthen our approach to protecting the \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of our people and our stakeholders. The Policy addresses \nthe key risks to human rights faced by our operations, including such topics as labour practices, \nresettlement activities, use of security, and engagement with communities, particularly vulnerable \ngroups such as indigenous peoples. It also reinforces our commitment to integrating human rights \nconsiderations into all business processes, and to protecting our stakeholders’ right to remedy by \nreviewing and strengthening the complaints and grievance mechanisms in place.  \n\nWe are aware that our global operations can have both a direct and indirect impact on the \nenvironment. We are committed to identifying, understanding and mitigating this environmental \nimpact, integrating this consideration into our strategic planning, management systems and day-to-\nday operations. We comply with applicable laws, regulations and other requirements for \nenvironmental management. Where these are less stringent than our own standards we seek to \nexceed the statutory requirements wherever possible. \n\nIn summary \nWe continue to work on improving the management of our operational impact, both positive and \nnegative. We are encouraged by the improvements in our performance. One major project, which \ncompleted in 2014, was the new acid plant at Mopani, which now captures 97% of its SO2 emissions \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f– a world-class standard. Prior to the purchase of the complex by Mopani, 100% of the SO2 generated \nby the operation was emitted directly into the atmosphere – the completion of this project ends an 80 \nyear legacy of SO2 emissions in the town of Mufulira. \n\nWe are proud of the external recognition that our efforts have received. This was recently evidenced \nby our admission into the membership of the ICMM following a rigorous independent assessment \nprocess.  \n\nWhile we are proud of the progress we have made in our sustainability performance, we recognise \nthat we must understand and address the challenges that remain. We believe that conducting our \nbusiness in a sustainable and responsible manner will deliver shared benefits to both our \nstakeholders and to our shareholders, to whom we are committed to delivering value. To this end, we \nwill continue to find ways in which to improve our processes, systems and performances and our goal \nremains one of continuous improvement across all our activities."}

The \n\nsuit  was  initiated  by  the  Maranhão  Human  Rights  Society  (SMDH),  the  Black  Cultural  Centre  of \n\nMaranhão (CCN) and the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI). It questions the government’s decision \n\nto  license  the  new  rail  line  in  discrete  pieces.  This  approach  allowed  Vale  to  produce  a  simplified \n\nenvironmental impact assessment (called a basic environmental plan), thereby avoiding an evaluation \n\nof  cumulative  impacts.  It  also  allowed  Vale  to  dispense  with  important  elements  of  the  standard \n\nenvironmental  review  process,  such  as  public  hearings  and  community  consultations.  Vale  was \n\nexempted from obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of the traditional communities affected by \n\nthe  project.  Consequently,  the  process  for  determining  mitigation  measures  and  for  assessing \n\ncompensation for damages was also inadequate. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOn  July  26,  2012,  a  federal  judge  recognized  the  irregularities  in  the  licensing  process  and \n\nordered  that  construction  on  the  rail  line  be  halted  until  Vale  revised  its  impact  studies,  carried  out \n\npublic meetings in the twenty-seven municipalities that the railway crosses, and obtained the free, prior \n\nand informed consent of affected indigenous and quilombola communities. Shortly after the court order \n\nwas issued, BNDES announced its decision to finance the project. The Brazilian government used the \n\nannouncement  to  justify  its  determination  that  the  expansion  project  is  in  the  public  interest.  This \n\ncharacterization  made  way  for  a  court  ruling  (suspensão  de  segurança)  that  allowed  construction  on \n\nthe railway to proceed, despite the irregularities, in order to avoid any impact on the national economy. \n\nThe complainants have appealed the decision and the matter will be reviewed shortly by the Superior \n\nCourt of Justice. \n\nThe  company’s  basic  environmental  plan  provides  partial  and  imprecise  information  regarding \n\nthe  number  of  families  that  will  need  to  be  relocated  to  make  way  for  the  expansion,  as  well  as  the \n\ntiming and conditions for relocation.  \n\nAccording to an administrative procedure initiated by the Public Defender, the company plans to \n\ndisplace  more  than  1000  families.  Some  of  these  families  have  already  been  forcibly  removed. \n\nNegotiations regarding their relocation were carried out in secret between Vale and affected individuals, \n\nwithout the supervision of government authorities. Residents lacked assess to legal advice.  \n\nCommunities  also  complain  about  the  lack  of  infrastructure to facilitate  safe  passage  over  the \n\nrailway.

Tais reuniões e audiências públicas observaram os termos da Resolução nº \n\n09/86  –  CONAMA,  que  prevê  o  procedimento  para  participação  popular  no  âmbito  do  licenciamento \n\nambiental.  \n\nEm decorrência da regularidade dos estudos e em todo o processo de consulta pública, a Vale \n\nobteve  as  devidas  licenças  ambientais  para  instalação  do  projeto,  obtendo,  inclusive,  anuência  da \n\nFUNAI e da Fundação Palmares para expansão da ferrovia.  \n\nApesar  do  contato  frequente  com  as  comunidades  afetadas,  ocupações  irregulares  vem \n\nocorrendo  na faixa de  domínio das  ferrovias,  ameaçando  tanto as operações quanto aos  ocupantes. \n\nVisando regularizar tal situação, a empresa vem negociando com as famílias a realocação,  por meio \n\nde  procedimentos  que  seguem  padrões  estabelecidos  pelo  Banco  Mundial.  Nossas  ações  são \n\norientadas  por  cinco  importantes  documentos  internos:  a  Norma  de  Remoção  Involuntária  de \n\nVulneráveis,  a  Política  de  Atuação  Social,  o  Procedimento  de  Gerenciamento  Social  para  Remoção \n\nInvoluntária,  o  Manual  de  Relação  com  Comunidades  para  Projetos  de  Capital  e  o  Guia  de \n\nRelacionamento  com  Comunidades,  que  estabelecem  princípios,  diretrizes,  critérios,  papéis  e \n\nresponsabilidades para a condução dos processos de remoção involuntária.  \n\nNo  que  tange  o  procedimento  de  Consentimento  Livre  Prévio  e  Informado  para  populações \n\nindígenas  e  tradicionais,  é  importante  destacar  que  tal  procedimento  não  se  encontra  devidamente \n\nregulamentado  em  âmbito nacional.  Embora o  Brasil  tenha  aderido  à  Convenção  nº  169 da OIT,  por \n\nmeio  do  Decreto  Legislativo  nº  143/2002, \n\nfaz-se  necessária  regulamentação  que  estipule \n\nprocedimentos, bem como os limites de aplicação da norma. \n\nIndependentemente  disso,  o  diálogo  constante  e  transparente  estabelecido  entre  a  Vale  e  as \n\ncomunidades  tradicionais  ao  longo  da  EFC,  assim  como  a  disponibilização  de  todas  as  informações \n\nnecessárias  relacionadas  ao  empreendimento,  tanto  presencialmente,  quanto  pela  internet,  atendem \n\nao objetivo essencial pretendido pela Convenção nº 169 da OIT. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fObserve-se  que  a  regularidade  do  licenciamento  ambiental  foi  reafirmada  em  decisão  judicial \n\ndo  Tribunal  Regional  Federal  (TRF),  que  reconheceu  que  as  medidas  adotadas  pela  Vale  estão  em \n\ntotal  consonância  com  as  exigências  dos  órgãos  técnico-ambientais  competentes.  A  título  de \n\nilustração, transcrevemos abaixo trecho de decisão judicial nesse sentido:  \n\n“Dos  dados  técnicos  e  estudos  presentes  no  processo  de  licenciamento,  praticamente \n\ntodos advêm da Administração Pública, a saber, da Fundação Cultural Palmares, do INCRA e \n\ndo IBAMA, e estão presentes nos estudos ambientais que compõem o licenciamento ambiental.  \n\nPortanto,  sem  elementos  concretos  que  justifiquem  a  paralisação  das  obras  de \n\nduplicação  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás,  a  tutela  antecipada  se  mostra  extremamente \n\nprejudicial  à  ordem  e  à  economia  pública,  posto  que  fulmina  a  atividade  do  Administrador \n\nPúblico, voltado ao licenciamento de implementação de obra de infraestrutura estratégica para \n\no  País,  que  visa  interligar  os  pátios  de  estacionamento  preexistentes,  “a  fim  de  suprir  a \n\ncrescente demanda associada ao transporte de insumos, materiais e pessoas” (fl. 5).”  \n\nFrisa-se  que  a  obra  não  se  refere  à  construção  ou  a  duplicação  inteira  da  ferrovia,  mas  tão \n\nsomente à interligação de pátios ferroviários já existentes ao lado da linha férrea original, o que trará \n\nbenefícios, inclusive, ao transporte de passageiros. Nesse sentido, a Vale vem investindo fortemente \n\nna formação de mão de obra local e em programas sociais e ambientais que visam o desenvolvimento \n\nsustentável da região e de sua população.  \n\nVale’s response  \n\nVale clarifies that the environmental license process concerning the duplication of EFC Railroad \n\nwas based in legal standards of federal, state and municipal range, in a way that the allegations of the \n\nECA Watch report do not correspond to the reality of the project. \n\nAll  studies,  plans  and  social-environmental  programs  developed  for  the  mitigation  of  impacts \n\ncaused by the work were regularly presented and consolidates in the Basic Environmental Plan (BEP). \n\nRegarding  the  indigenous  and  quilombolas  communities,  diagnostics,  impact  matrixes  and  specific \n\nrecommendations have been developed for each affected communities. \n\nOn  the  contrary  of  what  states  the  report,  Vale  acted  accordingly  to  the  legal  provisions, \n\npromoting  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special  regard  to  the  technical  studies  concerning \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\findigenous and quilombola communities, and lengthy dialog with said communities. The communication \n\nwith the population living near the railroad is constant. \n\nThere  have  been  public  reunions  with  the  affected  communities  in  July  09,  10,  12,  and  13  in \n\n2012, besides the reunions dedicated exclusively to the indigenous and quilombola communities. Said \n\nreunions observed the terms of the CONAMA Resolution nº 09/86, which states the means of popular \n\nparticipation in the environmental licensing process. \n\nSince  the  studies  done  and  all  the  public  consultation  process  have  been  done  with  strict \n\nregularity, Vale acquired the respective licenses for the installation of the project, including the approval \n\nof FUNAI and Fundação Palmares for the expansion of the railroad. \n\nAlthough  the  contact  with  affected  communities  is  frequent,  irregular  occupations  have  been \n\noccurring along the railroad, threatening both the operations and the occupiers. Aiming to regularize the \n\nsituation,  the  company  has  been  negotiating  with  the  families  their  reallocation,  by  procedures  that \n\nfollow standards set by the World Bank. Our actions are guided by   five key internal documents: The \n\nVulnerable Involuntary Relocation Norm, the Social Action Policy, Involuntary Resettlement Procedure \n\nof  Vulnerable  People,  the  Community  Relations  Manual  for  Capital  Projects  and  the  Community \n\nRelations  Guide;  establishing  principles,  instruction,  criteria,  roles  and  actions  in  the  process  of \n\ninvoluntary relocation. \n\nRegarding  the  procedure  of  Free,  Prior  and  Informed  Consent  of  indigenous  and  traditional \n\npopulations, it’s important to highlight that said procedure is not thoroughly regulated in national sphere. \n\nAlthough Brazil has signed the OIT Convention nº 169, by the Legislative Decree nº 143/2002, there is \n\nstill  necessity  of  a  regulation  that  stipulates  procedures,  as  well  as  limits  to  the  application  of  said \n\nnormative. \n\nAside  from  that,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialog  established  between  Vale  and  the \n\ntraditional  communities  located  along  EFC,  as  well  as  the  availability  of  all  necessary  information \n\nrelated to the enterprise, in person or by the internet, fulfill the essential purpose intended by the OIT \n\nConvention nº 169. \n\nIt’s  important  to  note  that  the  regularity  of  the  environmental  licensing  was  reaffirmed  in  a \n\njudicial  decision  of  the  Federal  Regional  Court  (FRC)  that  recognized  that  the  measures  adopted  by \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

To \n\nillustrate, we transcript below part of said decision: \n\n“Of  the  technical  data  and  studies  presented  in  the  licensing  processes,  practically  all \n\ncome  from  the  Public  Administration,  such  as,  Cultural  Foundation  Palmares,  INCRA  and \n\nIBAMA, and are present in the environmental studies that comprise the environmental licensing. \n\nTherefore, with no concrete elements that justify the halting of the duplication works on \n\nthe  EFC  Railroad,  the  preliminary injunction  presents  itself  as  extremely  harmful  to  the  order \n\nand public economy, as it fulminates the activity of the Public Administrator, inclined to licensing \n\nthe  implementation  of  infrastructure  works  strategic  to  the  country,  that  aim  to  connect \n\npreexistent  parking  yards,  ‘intending  to  supply  the  increasing  demand  associated  with  the \n\ntransport of inputs, materials and people’” \n\nWe would like emphasize that the work does not concern the construction or duplication of the \n\nentire  railroad,  but  only  the  interconnection  of  preexisting  parking  yards  next  to  the  original  railroad, \n\nwhich will bring benefits, inclusively, to the transportation of passengers.  In this sense, Vale has been \n\nstrongly investing in the training of local labor force and in social and environmental programs, which \n\naim for the sustainable development of the region and its population. \n\n2)  Ação Civil Pública Monge Belo  \n\nProcesso 0021337-52.2011.4.01.3700 \n\nAutor: Ministério Público Federal \n\nRéus: IBAMA e VALE SA \n\nLitisconsorte Ativo: Defensoria Publica da União  \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nA  lawsuit  was  initiated  in  2011  by  the  Federal  Public  Ministry  to  defend  the  rights  of  the \n\nquilombola  communities  of  Santa  Rosa  dos  Pretos  and  Monge  Belo  (Itapecuru-Mirim,  Maranhão).  In \n\n2012 the suit was dropped and an agreement was signed between the parties, establishing a series of \n\nobligations  for  Vale  and  three  federal  government  agencies.  The  company  agreed  to  construct \n\ninfrastructure to enhance community safety in the area of the railway and to refrain from intervening in \n\nthe communities’ collective land titling process.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn successive legal decisions, the most recent of which was issued on September 26, 2014, the \n\ncourt  found  that  neither  Vale  nor  the  government  agencies  had  fulfilled  their  obligations  to  the \n\ncommunities.  Also  in  September,  Santa  Rosa,  Monge  Belo  and  other  affected  communities  in  the \n\ninterior of Maranhão blocked the Carajás railway for five days. The communities protested Vale and the \n\ngovernment’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the legal agreement. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nEm decisão interlocutória datada de 26/09/2014, o juiz indicou que nem a Vale, nem os órgãos \n\npúblicos, cumpriram o acordo firmado com o Ministério Público Federal. Ocorre que em 23/10/2014, a \n\nVale apresentou ao Juízo sua resposta ao referido despacho em relação ao cumprimento do acordo, \n\ndemonstrando que atendeu aos pontos questionados, quais sejam: \n\nCorpos Hídricos: A Vale apresentou ao IBAMA os estudos referentes à recuperação dos corpos \n\nhídricos afetados pela Estrada de Ferro Carajás e sua duplicação. O Ibama solicitou complementações \n\nao  estudo,  que  foram  apresentadas  pela  Vale  27/06/2014.  Até  o  momento,  a  empresa  aguarda \n\ndefinição do órgão ambiental para dar continuidade ao projeto.   \n\nViadutos:  A  Vale  iniciou  a  construção  do  1º  viaduto  na  localidade  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  em \n\n07/08/2013, logo em seguida da emissão de autorização do IBAMA para início das obras. A obra de \n\nconstrução do viaduto encontra-se em andamento, estando dentro do prazo previsto no acordo com o \n\nMinistério Público Federal.  \n\nMelhorias: A Vale realizou melhorias nas 4 (quatro) passagens de nível localizadas em Monge \n\nBelo,  Santa  Helena,  Jaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  conforme  prevê  o \n\nacordo  com  o  Ministério  Público  Federal.  Destaca-se  que  os  próprios  analistas  do  IBAMA,  em \n\ninspeção realizada em 29/05/2014, atestaram que “todas as PN’s – passagens de nível - se encontram \n\nem  boas  condições  estruturais,  não  sendo  necessárias  ações  além  de  manutenção  de  rotina,  já \n\nexecutadas pela empresa”. \n\nDessa  forma,  a  Vale  entende  que  vem  cumprindo  com  suas  obrigações  e  que  não  houve \n\ndescumprimento do acordo celebrado com o Ministério Público Federal.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fVale’s response  \n\nOn an interlocutory decision of 26/09/2014, the judge indicated that neither Vale, nor the public \n\nagencies, fulfilled the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nIn  23/10/2014,  Vale  presented  at  court  its  answer  to  the  judicial  order,  concerning  the \n\ncompliance  with  the  agreement.  In  doing  so,  the  company  demonstrated  the  due  fulfillment  of  the \n\nquestioned points, namely: \n\nHydric  Bodies:  Vale  presented  to  IBAMA  the  studies  regarding  the  recuperation  of  the  hydric \n\nbodies  affected  by  Carajás  Railroad  and  its  duplication.  IBAMA  demanded  complementation  of  the \n\nstudies presented by VALE in 27/06/2014. Until this moment, the Company awaits definition from the \n\nEnvironmental Agency to give continuity do the project.  \n\nOverpass: Vale has initiated the construction of the first overpass of Jaibara dos Nogueiras site \n\nin  07/08/2013,  immediately  after  being  authorized  by  IBAMA  to  start  the  construction.  The  work  is \n\ncurrently in progress, being on schedule with the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nEnhancements:  Vale enhanced 4 (four)  level  crossings  located  in  Monge Belo,  Santa Helena, \n\nJaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  as  provided  in  the  agrément  with  the \n\nFederal  Public  Ministry.  It’s  important  to  note  that  the  analysts  of  IBAMA  themselves,  during  an \n\ninspection  done  in  29/05/14,  attested  that  “all  level  crossings  are  in  good  structural  condition,  being \n\nunnecessary any actions beyond the regular maintenance already performed by the Company”.  \n\nThus,  Vale  understands  that  it  has  been  complying  with  its  obligations  and  that  there  hasn’t \n\nbeen any non-compliance to the agreement celebrated with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\n3)  Acusações de Ex-Empregado \n\nIn 2013 a former Vale employee accused the company of illegally spying on a number of actors \n\nwho  are  critical  of  its  operations.  The  whistleblower,  who  played  an  important  role  in  the  company’s \n\nsecurity  department,  released  documents  revealing  that  the  company  took  steps  to  infiltrate  social \n\nmovements  that  accompany  affected  communities  in  the  defense  of  their  rights.  According  to  the \n\ndocuments,  the  company  developed  complex  biographical  files  from  information  that  was  allegedly \n\nobtained illegally. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe whistleblower accused the company of further illegal acts including the payment of bribes to \n\ngovernment officials, influence peddling, tapping telephones and hacking computers. Vale refuted the \n\nallegations  but  publicly  acknowledged  that  it  monitors  social  organizations.  In  2014,  the  International \n\nFederation of Human Rights conducted a fact-finding mission to Brazil and urged Brazilian authorities \n\nto take measures to prevent Vale from carrying out illegal espionage. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA  Vale  não  reconhece  e  refuta  as  alegações  do  ex-empregado.  As  autoridades  competentes \n\nestão  investigando  o  assunto  e  algumas  investigações  já  foram  arquivadas  devido  à  falta  de \n\ninformações e provas.  \n\nVale’s response \n\nVale  does  not  recognize  and  refute  the  allegations  of  the  former  employee.  The  competent \n\nauthorities are investigating the matter and some investigations were already dismissed due to lack of \n\ninformation and evidence.  \n\n4)  Gestão Ambiental no Sudeste do Pará e no Projeto S11D \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nThe project is also responsible for the destruction of native forest cover, and for damage to ecosystems \n\nand public health caused by air, soil and water contamination. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA Vale protege ou colabora com a proteção de uma área 3,5 vezes maior do que a ocupada por \n\nsuas  operações  globais,  totalizando  13,7  mil  Km²    de  áreas  naturais.  Em  2012,  a  Vale  investiu  US$ \n\n1,025 bilhão em proteção e conservação ambiental, em linha com o valor investido no ano anterior.  \n\nDesde  que  iniciou  a  extração  de  minério  de  ferro  no  sudeste  do  Pará,  em  1985,  a  empresa \n\ncontribui  com  a  preservação  de  mais  de  400  mil  hectares  de  mata  nativa,  através  da  criação  da \n\nFloresta Nacional de Carajás, e da proteção de outras áreas do bioma amazônico, em parceria com o \n\nInstituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio). \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fA Vale vem evoluindo no desenvolvimento de tecnologias e sistemas de gestão que a levaram \n\na  possuir,  hoje,  uma  operação  de  menor  impacto.  E  toda  essa  experiência  de  quase  30  anos  está \n\nreunida  no  projeto  S11D,  um  empreendimento  cuidadosamente  planejado  para  atingir  a  excelência \n\noperacional e à manutenção do meio ambiente ecologicamente equilibrado.  \n\nNo  projeto  S11D,  a  preocupação  em  diminuir  os  impactos  ambientais  começa  na  localização \n\nescolhida  para  a  instalação  da  usina  de  processamento  do  minério  de  ferro.  Será  em  uma  área  já \n\nantropizada (com interferência do ser humano) e fora da Floresta Nacional de Carajás.  \n\nCom o mesmo objetivo, de minimizar o impacto na floresta, 70% do ramal ferroviário que levará \n\na  produção  até  a  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás  também  serão  construídos  em  área  de  pastagem.  No \n\ntrecho que  passa  dentro  dos  limites  da  unidade  de  conservação,  serão  construídos  um  túnel  e  uma \n\nponte  para  evitar  impactos  diretos  na  vegetação  e  na  fauna,  com  investimento  adicional  de  R$  200 \n\nmilhões.  \n\nUma vez em operação, o projeto S11D seguirá diversos procedimentos que visam minimizar os \n\nimpactos  ambientais  negativos,  bem  como  maximizar  os \n\nimpactos  positivos  gerados  pelo \n\nempreendimento. . \n\nVale´s response \n\nVale  protects  or  helps  to  protect  an  area  3.5  times  larger  than  that  occupied  by  its  global \n\noperations,  adding  up  to  13,700  km2.  In  2011,  Vale  invested  US$1.030  billion  in  environmental \n\nmonitoring and protection, 40% up on the previous year.  \n\nSince  it  began  mining  iron  ore  in  the  the  Southeast  of  Pará  in  1985,  the  company  has  been \n\nhelping to conserve Carajás National Forest and other areas of the Amazon biome in partnership with \n\nthe Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).  \n\nOver the years, Vale has also developed technologies and management systems that have led \n\nto lower-impact operations. All of this experience gained over more than 30 years is incorporated into \n\nthe S11D project, which has been carefully planned to achieve operational excellence. \n\nIn  the  S11D  project,  Vale’s  concern  to  reduce  environmental  impacts  starts  with  the  location \n\nchosen for the iron ore processing plant: it will be built in an area already affected by mankind outside \n\nCarajás National Forest, thereby avoiding the need for deforestation. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

The aim of this process is \n\nto promote preventive and predictive maintenance, thereby improving the reliability of the railway.  \n\nIn  addition,  the  Carajás  Railway  has  high-technology  equipment  such  as  railway  tamping  and \n\nrenewal  machines,  ultrasound  equipment,  onboard  computers  in  locomotives,  training  simulators, \n\nfailsafe  signaling  systems,  derail  detection  equipment,  automated  wayside  rolling  stock  performance \n\ninstrumentation, hot box and hot wheel detection equipment, and distributed traction systems. \n\nIn  accordance  with  ANTT  standards,  Vale  uses  an  acoustic  signaling  system  as  a  safety \n\nmeasure  to  minimize  the  occurrence  of  accidents.  Horns  are  activated  by  the  locomotive  engineer \n\nwhenever there are official railway crossings or when people on or very near the track are detected, in \n\nline with criteria established in Vale’s Railway Operation Regulations. \n\nOfficial  railway  crossings  are  crossings  approved  and  recognized  by  Vale,  with  appropriate \n\nsignaling  and maintenance plans  in accordance with ABNT  standards. The Carajás  Railway  now  has \n\n126  railway  crossings  along  its  892  km  of  tracks,  spaced  approximately  7  km  apart  on  average.  In \n\naddition, Vale’s Community Relations and Business Security teams, together with the railway Operation \n\nand  Maintenance teams,  conduct periodic  actions focused  on the  safety of  the  people  living  near  the \n\nrailway.  This  work  includes  the  holding  of  safety  campaigns  and  the  distribution  of  materials  such  as \n\npamphlets,  educational  games,  brochures  and calendars, to be  used in classrooms,  at meetings  with \n\nlocal leaders and at railway crossings, etc. \n\nIn addition, in the process of expansion of the Carajás Railroad, 40 viaducts will be constructed \n\nover the railway, providing more security at the crossing of drivers and pedestrians. \n\nRio de Janeiro, 12 de Janeiro de 2015. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

The \n\nsuit  was  initiated  by  the  Maranhão  Human  Rights  Society  (SMDH),  the  Black  Cultural  Centre  of \n\nMaranhão (CCN) and the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI). It questions the government’s decision \n\nto  license  the  new  rail  line  in  discrete  pieces.  This  approach  allowed  Vale  to  produce  a  simplified \n\nenvironmental impact assessment (called a basic environmental plan), thereby avoiding an evaluation \n\nof  cumulative  impacts.  It  also  allowed  Vale  to  dispense  with  important  elements  of  the  standard \n\nenvironmental  review  process,  such  as  public  hearings  and  community  consultations.  Vale  was \n\nexempted from obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of the traditional communities affected by \n\nthe  project.  Consequently,  the  process  for  determining  mitigation  measures  and  for  assessing \n\ncompensation for damages was also inadequate. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

Shortly after the court order \n\nwas issued, BNDES announced its decision to finance the project. The Brazilian government used the \n\nannouncement  to  justify  its  determination  that  the  expansion  project  is  in  the  public  interest.  This \n\ncharacterization  made  way  for  a  court  ruling  (suspensão  de  segurança)  that  allowed  construction  on \n\nthe railway to proceed, despite the irregularities, in order to avoid any impact on the national economy. \n\nThe complainants have appealed the decision and the matter will be reviewed shortly by the Superior \n\nCourt of Justice. \n\nThe  company’s  basic  environmental  plan  provides  partial  and  imprecise  information  regarding \n\nthe  number  of  families  that  will  need  to  be  relocated  to  make  way  for  the  expansion,  as  well  as  the \n\ntiming and conditions for relocation.  \n\nAccording to an administrative procedure initiated by the Public Defender, the company plans to \n\ndisplace  more  than  1000  families.  Some  of  these  families  have  already  been  forcibly  removed. \n\nNegotiations regarding their relocation were carried out in secret between Vale and affected individuals, \n\nwithout the supervision of government authorities. Residents lacked assess to legal advice.  \n\nCommunities  also  complain  about  the  lack  of  infrastructure to facilitate  safe  passage  over  the \n\nrailway. With the second train line in operation, the frequency of passing trains will increase, exposing \n\nlocal residents to even greater risk”. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA  Vale  esclarece  que  o  licenciamento  ambiental  da  duplicação  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás \n\n(EFC)  foi  respaldado  nos  padrões  legais  de  âmbito  federal,  estadual  e  municipais,  de  forma  que  as \n\nalegações constantes do relatório da ECA Watch não correspondem à realidade do projeto.  \n\nTodos  os  estudos,  planos  e  programas  socioambientais  desenvolvidos  para  mitigação  dos \n\nimpactos  causados  pela  obra  foram  regularmente  apresentados  e  consolidados  no  Plano  Básico \n\nAmbiental  (PBA).  Em  relação  às  comunidades  indígenas  e  quilombolas,  foram  desenvolvidos \n\ndiagnósticos, matrizes de impacto e recomendações específicas para cada comunidade afetada.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

A \n\ninterlocução com as comunidades próximas à ferrovia é permanente.  \n\nRegistra-se  que  foram  realizadas  reuniões  públicas  com  as  comunidades  afetadas  nas  datas \n\nde  09,  10,  12,  13  de  julho  de  2012,  além  das  reuniões  dedicadas  exclusivamente  às  comunidades \n\nquilombolas e indígenas. Tais reuniões e audiências públicas observaram os termos da Resolução nº \n\n09/86  –  CONAMA,  que  prevê  o  procedimento  para  participação  popular  no  âmbito  do  licenciamento \n\nambiental.  \n\nEm decorrência da regularidade dos estudos e em todo o processo de consulta pública, a Vale \n\nobteve  as  devidas  licenças  ambientais  para  instalação  do  projeto,  obtendo,  inclusive,  anuência  da \n\nFUNAI e da Fundação Palmares para expansão da ferrovia.  \n\nApesar  do  contato  frequente  com  as  comunidades  afetadas,  ocupações  irregulares  vem \n\nocorrendo  na faixa de  domínio das  ferrovias,  ameaçando  tanto as operações quanto aos  ocupantes. \n\nVisando regularizar tal situação, a empresa vem negociando com as famílias a realocação,  por meio \n\nde  procedimentos  que  seguem  padrões  estabelecidos  pelo  Banco  Mundial.  Nossas  ações  são \n\norientadas  por  cinco  importantes  documentos  internos:  a  Norma  de  Remoção  Involuntária  de \n\nVulneráveis,  a  Política  de  Atuação  Social,  o  Procedimento  de  Gerenciamento  Social  para  Remoção \n\nInvoluntária,  o  Manual  de  Relação  com  Comunidades  para  Projetos  de  Capital  e  o  Guia  de \n\nRelacionamento  com  Comunidades,  que  estabelecem  princípios,  diretrizes,  critérios,  papéis  e \n\nresponsabilidades para a condução dos processos de remoção involuntária.  \n\nNo  que  tange  o  procedimento  de  Consentimento  Livre  Prévio  e  Informado  para  populações \n\nindígenas  e  tradicionais,  é  importante  destacar  que  tal  procedimento  não  se  encontra  devidamente \n\nregulamentado  em  âmbito nacional.  Embora o  Brasil  tenha  aderido  à  Convenção  nº  169 da OIT,  por \n\nmeio  do  Decreto  Legislativo  nº  143/2002, \n\nfaz-se  necessária  regulamentação  que  estipule \n\nprocedimentos, bem como os limites de aplicação da norma. \n\nIndependentemente  disso,  o  diálogo  constante  e  transparente  estabelecido  entre  a  Vale  e  as \n\ncomunidades  tradicionais  ao  longo  da  EFC,  assim  como  a  disponibilização  de  todas  as  informações \n\nnecessárias  relacionadas  ao  empreendimento,  tanto  presencialmente,  quanto  pela  internet,  atendem \n\nao objetivo essencial pretendido pela Convenção nº 169 da OIT. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fObserve-se  que  a  regularidade  do  licenciamento  ambiental  foi  reafirmada  em  decisão  judicial \n\ndo  Tribunal  Regional  Federal  (TRF),  que  reconheceu  que  as  medidas  adotadas  pela  Vale  estão  em \n\ntotal  consonância  com  as  exigências  dos  órgãos  técnico-ambientais  competentes.  A  título  de \n\nilustração, transcrevemos abaixo trecho de decisão judicial nesse sentido:  \n\n“Dos  dados  técnicos  e  estudos  presentes  no  processo  de  licenciamento,  praticamente \n\ntodos advêm da Administração Pública, a saber, da Fundação Cultural Palmares, do INCRA e \n\ndo IBAMA, e estão presentes nos estudos ambientais que compõem o licenciamento ambiental.  \n\nPortanto,  sem  elementos  concretos  que  justifiquem  a  paralisação  das  obras  de \n\nduplicação  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás,  a  tutela  antecipada  se  mostra  extremamente \n\nprejudicial  à  ordem  e  à  economia  pública,  posto  que  fulmina  a  atividade  do  Administrador \n\nPúblico, voltado ao licenciamento de implementação de obra de infraestrutura estratégica para \n\no  País,  que  visa  interligar  os  pátios  de  estacionamento  preexistentes,  “a  fim  de  suprir  a \n\ncrescente demanda associada ao transporte de insumos, materiais e pessoas” (fl. 5).”  \n\nFrisa-se  que  a  obra  não  se  refere  à  construção  ou  a  duplicação  inteira  da  ferrovia,  mas  tão \n\nsomente à interligação de pátios ferroviários já existentes ao lado da linha férrea original, o que trará \n\nbenefícios, inclusive, ao transporte de passageiros. Nesse sentido, a Vale vem investindo fortemente \n\nna formação de mão de obra local e em programas sociais e ambientais que visam o desenvolvimento \n\nsustentável da região e de sua população.  \n\nVale’s response  \n\nVale clarifies that the environmental license process concerning the duplication of EFC Railroad \n\nwas based in legal standards of federal, state and municipal range, in a way that the allegations of the \n\nECA Watch report do not correspond to the reality of the project. \n\nAll  studies,  plans  and  social-environmental  programs  developed  for  the  mitigation  of  impacts \n\ncaused by the work were regularly presented and consolidates in the Basic Environmental Plan (BEP). \n\nRegarding  the  indigenous  and  quilombolas  communities,  diagnostics,  impact  matrixes  and  specific \n\nrecommendations have been developed for each affected communities. \n\nOn  the  contrary  of  what  states  the  report,  Vale  acted  accordingly  to  the  legal  provisions, \n\npromoting  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special  regard  to  the  technical  studies  concerning \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

The communication \n\nwith the population living near the railroad is constant. \n\nThere  have  been  public  reunions  with  the  affected  communities  in  July  09,  10,  12,  and  13  in \n\n2012, besides the reunions dedicated exclusively to the indigenous and quilombola communities. Said \n\nreunions observed the terms of the CONAMA Resolution nº 09/86, which states the means of popular \n\nparticipation in the environmental licensing process. \n\nSince  the  studies  done  and  all  the  public  consultation  process  have  been  done  with  strict \n\nregularity, Vale acquired the respective licenses for the installation of the project, including the approval \n\nof FUNAI and Fundação Palmares for the expansion of the railroad. \n\nAlthough  the  contact  with  affected  communities  is  frequent,  irregular  occupations  have  been \n\noccurring along the railroad, threatening both the operations and the occupiers. Aiming to regularize the \n\nsituation,  the  company  has  been  negotiating  with  the  families  their  reallocation,  by  procedures  that \n\nfollow standards set by the World Bank. Our actions are guided by   five key internal documents: The \n\nVulnerable Involuntary Relocation Norm, the Social Action Policy, Involuntary Resettlement Procedure \n\nof  Vulnerable  People,  the  Community  Relations  Manual  for  Capital  Projects  and  the  Community \n\nRelations  Guide;  establishing  principles,  instruction,  criteria,  roles  and  actions  in  the  process  of \n\ninvoluntary relocation. \n\nRegarding  the  procedure  of  Free,  Prior  and  Informed  Consent  of  indigenous  and  traditional \n\npopulations, it’s important to highlight that said procedure is not thoroughly regulated in national sphere. \n\nAlthough Brazil has signed the OIT Convention nº 169, by the Legislative Decree nº 143/2002, there is \n\nstill  necessity  of  a  regulation  that  stipulates  procedures,  as  well  as  limits  to  the  application  of  said \n\nnormative. \n\nAside  from  that,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialog  established  between  Vale  and  the \n\ntraditional  communities  located  along  EFC,  as  well  as  the  availability  of  all  necessary  information \n\nrelated to the enterprise, in person or by the internet, fulfill the essential purpose intended by the OIT \n\nConvention nº 169. \n\nIt’s  important  to  note  that  the  regularity  of  the  environmental  licensing  was  reaffirmed  in  a \n\njudicial  decision  of  the  Federal  Regional  Court  (FRC)  that  recognized  that  the  measures  adopted  by \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

The communities protested Vale and the \n\ngovernment’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the legal agreement. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nEm decisão interlocutória datada de 26/09/2014, o juiz indicou que nem a Vale, nem os órgãos \n\npúblicos, cumpriram o acordo firmado com o Ministério Público Federal. Ocorre que em 23/10/2014, a \n\nVale apresentou ao Juízo sua resposta ao referido despacho em relação ao cumprimento do acordo, \n\ndemonstrando que atendeu aos pontos questionados, quais sejam: \n\nCorpos Hídricos: A Vale apresentou ao IBAMA os estudos referentes à recuperação dos corpos \n\nhídricos afetados pela Estrada de Ferro Carajás e sua duplicação. O Ibama solicitou complementações \n\nao  estudo,  que  foram  apresentadas  pela  Vale  27/06/2014.  Até  o  momento,  a  empresa  aguarda \n\ndefinição do órgão ambiental para dar continuidade ao projeto.   \n\nViadutos:  A  Vale  iniciou  a  construção  do  1º  viaduto  na  localidade  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  em \n\n07/08/2013, logo em seguida da emissão de autorização do IBAMA para início das obras. A obra de \n\nconstrução do viaduto encontra-se em andamento, estando dentro do prazo previsto no acordo com o \n\nMinistério Público Federal.  \n\nMelhorias: A Vale realizou melhorias nas 4 (quatro) passagens de nível localizadas em Monge \n\nBelo,  Santa  Helena,  Jaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  conforme  prevê  o \n\nacordo  com  o  Ministério  Público  Federal.  Destaca-se  que  os  próprios  analistas  do  IBAMA,  em \n\ninspeção realizada em 29/05/2014, atestaram que “todas as PN’s – passagens de nível - se encontram \n\nem  boas  condições  estruturais,  não  sendo  necessárias  ações  além  de  manutenção  de  rotina,  já \n\nexecutadas pela empresa”. \n\nDessa  forma,  a  Vale  entende  que  vem  cumprindo  com  suas  obrigações  e  que  não  houve \n\ndescumprimento do acordo celebrado com o Ministério Público Federal.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fVale’s response  \n\nOn an interlocutory decision of 26/09/2014, the judge indicated that neither Vale, nor the public \n\nagencies, fulfilled the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nIn  23/10/2014,  Vale  presented  at  court  its  answer  to  the  judicial  order,  concerning  the \n\ncompliance  with  the  agreement.  In  doing  so,  the  company  demonstrated  the  due  fulfillment  of  the \n\nquestioned points, namely: \n\nHydric  Bodies:  Vale  presented  to  IBAMA  the  studies  regarding  the  recuperation  of  the  hydric \n\nbodies  affected  by  Carajás  Railroad  and  its  duplication.  IBAMA  demanded  complementation  of  the \n\nstudies presented by VALE in 27/06/2014. Until this moment, the Company awaits definition from the \n\nEnvironmental Agency to give continuity do the project.  \n\nOverpass: Vale has initiated the construction of the first overpass of Jaibara dos Nogueiras site \n\nin  07/08/2013,  immediately  after  being  authorized  by  IBAMA  to  start  the  construction.  The  work  is \n\ncurrently in progress, being on schedule with the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nEnhancements:  Vale enhanced 4 (four)  level  crossings  located  in  Monge Belo,  Santa Helena, \n\nJaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  as  provided  in  the  agrément  with  the \n\nFederal  Public  Ministry.  It’s  important  to  note  that  the  analysts  of  IBAMA  themselves,  during  an \n\ninspection  done  in  29/05/14,  attested  that  “all  level  crossings  are  in  good  structural  condition,  being \n\nunnecessary any actions beyond the regular maintenance already performed by the Company”.  \n\nThus,  Vale  understands  that  it  has  been  complying  with  its  obligations  and  that  there  hasn’t \n\nbeen any non-compliance to the agreement celebrated with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\n3)  Acusações de Ex-Empregado \n\nIn 2013 a former Vale employee accused the company of illegally spying on a number of actors \n\nwho  are  critical  of  its  operations.  The  whistleblower,  who  played  an  important  role  in  the  company’s \n\nsecurity  department,  released  documents  revealing  that  the  company  took  steps  to  infiltrate  social \n\nmovements  that  accompany  affected  communities  in  the  defense  of  their  rights.  According  to  the \n\ndocuments,  the  company  developed  complex  biographical  files  from  information  that  was  allegedly \n\nobtained illegally. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe whistleblower accused the company of further illegal acts including the payment of bribes to \n\ngovernment officials, influence peddling, tapping telephones and hacking computers. Vale refuted the \n\nallegations  but  publicly  acknowledged  that  it  monitors  social  organizations.  In  2014,  the  International \n\nFederation of Human Rights conducted a fact-finding mission to Brazil and urged Brazilian authorities \n\nto take measures to prevent Vale from carrying out illegal espionage. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA  Vale  não  reconhece  e  refuta  as  alegações  do  ex-empregado.  As  autoridades  competentes \n\nestão  investigando  o  assunto  e  algumas  investigações  já  foram  arquivadas  devido  à  falta  de \n\ninformações e provas.  \n\nVale’s response \n\nVale  does  not  recognize  and  refute  the  allegations  of  the  former  employee.  The  competent \n\nauthorities are investigating the matter and some investigations were already dismissed due to lack of \n\ninformation and evidence.  \n\n4)  Gestão Ambiental no Sudeste do Pará e no Projeto S11D \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nThe project is also responsible for the destruction of native forest cover, and for damage to ecosystems \n\nand public health caused by air, soil and water contamination. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA Vale protege ou colabora com a proteção de uma área 3,5 vezes maior do que a ocupada por \n\nsuas  operações  globais,  totalizando  13,7  mil  Km²    de  áreas  naturais.  Em  2012,  a  Vale  investiu  US$ \n\n1,025 bilhão em proteção e conservação ambiental, em linha com o valor investido no ano anterior.  \n\nDesde  que  iniciou  a  extração  de  minério  de  ferro  no  sudeste  do  Pará,  em  1985,  a  empresa \n\ncontribui  com  a  preservação  de  mais  de  400  mil  hectares  de  mata  nativa,  através  da  criação  da \n\nFloresta Nacional de Carajás, e da proteção de outras áreas do bioma amazônico, em parceria com o \n\nInstituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio). \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fA Vale vem evoluindo no desenvolvimento de tecnologias e sistemas de gestão que a levaram \n\na  possuir,  hoje,  uma  operação  de  menor  impacto.  E  toda  essa  experiência  de  quase  30  anos  está \n\nreunida  no  projeto  S11D,  um  empreendimento  cuidadosamente  planejado  para  atingir  a  excelência \n\noperacional e à manutenção do meio ambiente ecologicamente equilibrado.  \n\nNo  projeto  S11D,  a  preocupação  em  diminuir  os  impactos  ambientais  começa  na  localização \n\nescolhida  para  a  instalação  da  usina  de  processamento  do  minério  de  ferro.  Será  em  uma  área  já \n\nantropizada (com interferência do ser humano) e fora da Floresta Nacional de Carajás.  \n\nCom o mesmo objetivo, de minimizar o impacto na floresta, 70% do ramal ferroviário que levará \n\na  produção  até  a  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás  também  serão  construídos  em  área  de  pastagem.  No \n\ntrecho que  passa  dentro  dos  limites  da  unidade  de  conservação,  serão  construídos  um  túnel  e  uma \n\nponte  para  evitar  impactos  diretos  na  vegetação  e  na  fauna,  com  investimento  adicional  de  R$  200 \n\nmilhões.  \n\nUma vez em operação, o projeto S11D seguirá diversos procedimentos que visam minimizar os \n\nimpactos  ambientais  negativos,  bem  como  maximizar  os \n\nimpactos  positivos  gerados  pelo \n\nempreendimento. . \n\nVale´s response \n\nVale  protects  or  helps  to  protect  an  area  3.5  times  larger  than  that  occupied  by  its  global \n\noperations,  adding  up  to  13,700  km2.  In  2011,  Vale  invested  US$1.030  billion  in  environmental \n\nmonitoring and protection, 40% up on the previous year.  \n\nSince  it  began  mining  iron  ore  in  the  the  Southeast  of  Pará  in  1985,  the  company  has  been \n\nhelping to conserve Carajás National Forest and other areas of the Amazon biome in partnership with \n\nthe Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).  \n\nOver the years, Vale has also developed technologies and management systems that have led \n\nto lower-impact operations. All of this experience gained over more than 30 years is incorporated into \n\nthe S11D project, which has been carefully planned to achieve operational excellence. \n\nIn  the  S11D  project,  Vale’s  concern  to  reduce  environmental  impacts  starts  with  the  location \n\nchosen for the iron ore processing plant: it will be built in an area already affected by mankind outside \n\nCarajás National Forest, thereby avoiding the need for deforestation. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

The aim of this process is \n\nto promote preventive and predictive maintenance, thereby improving the reliability of the railway.  \n\nIn  addition,  the  Carajás  Railway  has  high-technology  equipment  such  as  railway  tamping  and \n\nrenewal  machines,  ultrasound  equipment,  onboard  computers  in  locomotives,  training  simulators, \n\nfailsafe  signaling  systems,  derail  detection  equipment,  automated  wayside  rolling  stock  performance \n\ninstrumentation, hot box and hot wheel detection equipment, and distributed traction systems. \n\nIn  accordance  with  ANTT  standards,  Vale  uses  an  acoustic  signaling  system  as  a  safety \n\nmeasure  to  minimize  the  occurrence  of  accidents.  Horns  are  activated  by  the  locomotive  engineer \n\nwhenever there are official railway crossings or when people on or very near the track are detected, in \n\nline with criteria established in Vale’s Railway Operation Regulations. \n\nOfficial  railway  crossings  are  crossings  approved  and  recognized  by  Vale,  with  appropriate \n\nsignaling  and maintenance plans  in accordance with ABNT  standards. The Carajás  Railway  now  has \n\n126  railway  crossings  along  its  892  km  of  tracks,  spaced  approximately  7  km  apart  on  average.  In \n\naddition, Vale’s Community Relations and Business Security teams, together with the railway Operation \n\nand  Maintenance teams,  conduct periodic  actions focused  on the  safety of  the  people  living  near  the \n\nrailway.  This  work  includes  the  holding  of  safety  campaigns  and  the  distribution  of  materials  such  as \n\npamphlets,  educational  games,  brochures  and calendars, to be  used in classrooms,  at meetings  with \n\nlocal leaders and at railway crossings, etc. \n\nIn addition, in the process of expansion of the Carajás Railroad, 40 viaducts will be constructed \n\nover the railway, providing more security at the crossing of drivers and pedestrians. \n\nRio de Janeiro, 12 de Janeiro de 2015. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

The \nprevious  Espinar  Mayor,  Oscar  Mollahuanca,  was  involved  in  the  protests  as  mayor  in  both \n2000 and 2012, and as advisor to the United Defence Front for Espinar Interests (FUDIE) in \n2005.  \n\nIn  2002  a  Dialogue  Table  was  established  to  investigate  community  grievances  on  land \nexpropriation,  environmental  pollution  and  human  rights  with  the  participation  of  six  local \ncommunities  in  the  direct  area  of  influence  of  the  mine,  Tintaya  representatives  and  non-\ngovernmental organisations Oxfam Americas, Conicami and Cooperación.  \n\nOn 3 September 2003, BHP Billiton signed the Framework Agreement with Espinar provincial \nauthorities. Under the Framework Agreement, Tintaya and subsequently  Antapaccay makes \nan annual contribution of 3% of profit before tax to finance social improvement projects for the \nbenefit of over 70 communities in Espinar province among other commitments.  \n\nSince  acquiring the Tintaya mine from BHP Billiton,  Xstrata and subsequently  Glencore has \nfully  met  and  in  many  aspects  gone  beyond  all  its  obligations  under  the  Framework \nAgreement. The company has resolved the grievances that were discussed in the context of \nthe  Dialogue  Table.  As  a  result  it  was  agreed  to  rename  the  Dialogue  Table  as  the \nDevelopment  Table  in  2011,  a  change  that  reflected  how  the  mechanism  has  evolved  from \none  that  managed  liabilities  caused  by  historical  mining  activities  to  one  that  is  focused  on \npromoting  local  development.  Under  our  management,  all  the  grievances  relating  to  land \nexpropriation were resolved and it was agreed to dissolve the working group that addressed \nthis area of grievance.  \n\nThe  Framework  Agreement,  through  which  approximately  70%  of  our  voluntary  investments \nare  made,  is  supervised  by  a  General  Assembly  formed  by  37  organisations.  Tintaya-\nAntapaccay  has  one  representative  on  the  Management  Committee  which  is  comprised  of \neight  people  including  two  local  authorities,  three  civil  society  organisation  and  two  local \ncommunity  representatives.  The  Framework  Agreement  budget  is  divided  between  mega-\nprojects (20%) and district projects (80%). In the latter case, the budget is divided among the \neight  districts  of  Espinar  province  based  on  the  size  of  the  population  (80%)  and  poverty \nindicators  (20%)  of  each  district.  Community  members  then  participate  in  workshops  to \ndecide  which  projects  should  be  implemented  according  to  the  budget.  Since  inception, \nTintaya-Antapaccay  has  contributed  over  US$97million  through  this  mechanism  which  has \nenabled  the  implementation  of  major  infrastructure  projects  such  as  the  Espinar  Hospital,  a \nDairy  Plant,  the  Centre  of  Educational  Resources  of  Espinar  and  recently  an  Alpaca  Fibre \nPlant and has funded more than 800 smaller community projects in the region. \n\nWe have surpassed our commitments under the Framework Agreement to ensure that 70% of \nindirect and direct unskilled labour is drawn from local communities. We have increased local \nemployment  of  unskilled  labour  to  100%  at  the  new  Antapaccay  mine.  As  a  result  of  the \ndedicated training and procurement programs that we have put in place, Tintaya-Antapaccay \nhas  also  facilitated  the  start-up  of  around  70  local  suppliers  that  provide  services  such  as \ncatering, electrical services and maintenance. \n\nSince  acquiring  Tintaya,  we  have  worked  relentlessly  to  ensure  that  the  Framework \nAgreement  is  managed  effectively  and  delivers  sustainable  projects  to  provide  long-term \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fbenefits  for  the  communities  in  Espinar  province.  Since  the  agreement  was  signed  in  2003, \nmore  than  800  projects  agreed  by  the  communities  and  the  Espinar  authorities  have  been \ncompleted, including several large-scale infrastructure projects that benefit several districts of \nthe province. Each of these projects have been identified, developed and implemented by a \nmanagement committee comprising representatives from the Provincial  Municipality (current \nchair)  and  District  Municipalities  of  Espinar,  civil  society  organisations  including  FUDIE  (the \nEspinar  Civil  Society  Interest  Defence  Association),  communities  and  Tintaya-Antapaccay. \nThe  current  structure  provides  an  important  balance  between  government,  non-government \norganisations,  community  representatives  and  the  private  sector  and  has,  we  believe,  been \nan important factor in enabling the Framework Agreement to deliver projects more efficiently \nand effectively than many other social development funds in Peru. \n\nWe  have  continued  to  invest  significantly  in  social  and  community  development.  Since \nacquiring  Tintaya  in  2006,  we  have  voluntarily  contributed  around  US$82  million  under  the \nFramework Agreement and almost US$93 million  in  other donation mechanisms, in addition \nto our substantial tax and royalty payments that total  more than $915 million  over the same \nperiod.  \n\nThe Framework Agreement is an effective and very positive initiative between the company, \nthe Espinar province and its communities, which has been delivering tangible and sustainable \nbenefits  to  local  communities  over  a  number  of  years.  We  continuously  engage  with \ncommunities, representative organisations and the provincial authorities of Espinar to discuss \nhow we can work together to enhance the Framework Agreement. \n\nActive environmental management \nWe  strongly  reject  the  allegations  of  environmental  pollution  by  either  the  Tintaya  or \nAntapaccay mines. Our operations comply in full with all environmental and social regulations. \nOur operations undertake environmental monitoring on a regular basis and  are  subjected to \nboth external and internal audits to evaluate the site’s environmental performance. \n\nIn recent years, there have been two independent environmental studies on the presence of \nheavy metals in the waterways, soils and inhabitants of the catchment area of the Tintaya and \nAntapaccay  mines.  The  first  study  into  community  health  was  conducted  in  2010  by  Peru’s \nregional  health  ministry  (Censopas)  as  part  of  a  baseline  study  into  the  Quechua  mining \nproject, owned by another company, 10 kilometres upstream of the Tintaya mine. The second \nstudy  was  sponsored  by  two  NGOs,  Germany’s  Misereor  and  Peru’s  Vicaría  de  la \nSolidaridad, and conducted by a German student, Eike Hümpel, in 2011. It should be noted \nthat  this  study’s  methodology  was  seriously  flawed  in  that  it  did  not  take  into  account  the \ngeological characteristics of the area, such as the natural background mineralisation present \nin the region, which includes heavy metals.  \n\nNeither report states that Tintaya-Antapaccay is the cause of the presence of heavy metals in \nthe  area.  Both  reports  have  been  misused  by  the  previous  Espinar  Mayor  Oscar \nMollohuanca, non-governmental and civil society organisations and members of the Peruvian \nparliament as proof that Tintaya-Antapaccay is contaminating the environment. This incorrect \nassumption  was  widely  reported  in  the  Peruvian  press  and  undoubtedly  contributed  to \nheightening  tensions  among  local  people  prior  to  the  protests  in  May  2012.  In  fact,  the \nPeruvian  parliament’s  Ethics  Commission  launched  an  inquiry  against  a  Congress  member \nfor using the 2010 study to accuse the Tintaya mine of pollution and she subsequently issued \na retraction.  \n\nThe  Tintaya-Antapaccay  mine  is  located  in  a  naturally  highly-mineralised  area  along  the \nYauri-Andahuaylas copper belt where historical artisan and small-scale mining has occurred \nand  is  still  active.  Tintaya-Antapaccay  operates  a  closed-circuit  water  management  system \nand does not discharge mine water into the environment, although it holds permits to do so. \nTintaya-Antapaccay does not use, or mine, lead, arsenic or mercury at its operations.  \n\nOur environmental performance is subject to numerous internal and external audits. Peruvian \nregulatory  organisations  (previously  Osinergmin,  a  state  organisation  responsible  for \nsupervising  mining  and  energy  investments,  and  now  Peru’s  environmental  audit  and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fevaluation  organisation  OEFA)  have  taken  hundreds  of  samples  and  conducted  several \nmonitoring programs as part of their audit faculties in recent years and found no evidence of \npollution. All regulatory and participatory monitoring activities to date have demonstrated that \nTintaya-Antapaccay  operates  in  line  with  Peruvian  law  and  we  have  always  rejected \nallegations of environmental pollution at our Tintaya-Antapaccay operations. \n\nRegardless of location, we always aim to secure broad-based support for our activities. This \nwas  evidenced  by  the  overwhelming  community  support  we  received  during  the  public \nconsultation  process \nImpact \nAssessment. Today, Tintaya-Antapaccay undertakes participatory monitoring of its operations \nand the surrounding areas with the community and the Peruvian authorities.  \n\nthe  Antapaccay  expansion  project’s  Environmental \n\nfor \n\n2012 social unrest \nWe were deeply concerned that the protests in Espinar escalated into violence at the end of \nMay  2012.  At  the  time,  Tintaya-Antapaccay  advised  Mayor  Mollohuanca  that,  although  it \nwould  be  unable  to  meet  his  demand  to  increase  our  contribution  under  the  Framework \nAgreement to 30% from 3%, it was open to discussing enhancements to the agreement, for \nexample  by  increasing  commitments  to  hire  local  people  at  our  operations.  Despite  these \nattempts to maintain a dialogue with the communities and reach a peaceful solution, and the \nnational  government’s  prior  agreement  to  conduct  further  intensive  joint  environmental \nmonitoring in the province, the protests went ahead.  \n\nDuring  the  protests,  we  were  highly  concerned  for  the  safety  of  our  employees  and \ncontractors  in  the  region  and  of  the  local  communities  of  Espinar.  We  do  not  condone \nviolence of any kind and we are committed to respecting the human rights of our employees \nand community members in the region. \n\nWe  are  deeply  committed  to  respecting  human  rights.  Wherever  we  operate,  we  engage \nactively  with host communities to build constructive  dialogue, and pay  particular  attention to \nminimising  any  risk  of  human  rights  abuses  by  our  employees,  contractors,  or  security \nproviders.  At  our  sites  operating  in  regions  considered  to  be  high  risk,  we  use  the  United \nNations  Voluntary  Principles  on  Security  and  Human  Rights  (Voluntary  Principles)  to  guide \nthe  use  of  private  security  and  the  interaction  with  public  service  personnel.  Our  risk \nassessment and training methodologies are aligned with the Voluntary Principles. We actively \nengage  with  host  governments  to  raise  awareness  of  the  Voluntary  Principles  as  an \ninternational best practice standard in the area of security and human rights.  \n\nAll of our sites are required to conduct  human rights  risk assessments that are  aligned  with \nthe Voluntary Principles. For sites located in regions considered to be high-risk, such as Peru, \nhuman rights risk assessments take place on an annual basis; this approach is undertaken at \nTintaya-Antapaccay.    In  addition,  Tintaya-  Antapaccay  has  actively  engaged  with  Socios \nPerú, a local multi-stakeholder network working with the government to promote the Voluntary \nPrinciples, to share learnings and best practices with other operators in the country.  \n\nWe  incorporated  human  rights  into  the  initial  project  risk  assessment  for  the  Antapaccay \nexpansion project. This risk assessment included a review of the strength of the rule of law, \nthe potential for conflict and the challenges and potential impacts for local communities.  \n\nAs part  of our commitment to human rights,  all of our employee and contractors at  Tintaya-\nAntapaccay  receive  training  on  human  rights.  To  date  over  5,000  people,  including \nconstruction  contractors  at  the  Antapaccay  expansion  project,  have  participated  in  human \nrights awareness programmes. All security personnel working at Tintaya-Antapaccay receive \ntraining on our internal policies and procedures for human rights.  \n\nRelationship with the police \nThe  authors  of  the  Corporate  Conquistadors  report  have  fundamentally  misunderstood  the \nrelationship  between  Tintaya-Antapaccay  and  the  Policía  Nacional  del  Perú  (PNP).  It  is \nincorrect  to  state  that  the  PNP  acted  as  the  company’s  private  security  force  or  acted  on \nbehalf  of  the  company  during  the  May  2012  protests.  The  PNP  was  at  all  times  during  the \nMay  2012  protests  operating  under  its  own  chain  of  command  and  under  the  control  and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fauthority of the Peruvian Government. Tintaya-Antapaccay did not seek to (and, in any event, \nwould not be able to) exercise any direction over the PNP’s response to the protests. \n\nWhilst the Corporate Conquistadors report is correct to note that there was an agreement in \nplace  between  the  PNP  and  the  company,  dated  16  May  2011,  it  is  clear  that  neither  the \nauthors of the report, nor the authors of the report entitled “Mercenary Police at the service of \nMining  corporations”  cited  as  support  in  footnote  16,  have  had  sight  of  the  relevant \nagreement.  Accordingly,  none  of  those  authors  are  in  a  position  properly  to  understand  or \nspeak to the content or purpose of that agreement. We have clarified the nature and scope of \nthat agreement below. \n\nThe agreement was executed pursuant to Peruvian law, the Supreme Decree No. 019-71-IN, \nNo.053-2005-PCM,  Decree  Law  25707  and  Law  28305,  No.  086-92-PCM,  which  was \napproved by Supreme Decree 053-2005-PCM. In accordance with those laws, the agreement \nprovided  for  extraordinary  supplementary  police  services  in  matters  of  surveillance  and \nsafety,  inspection  and  control  of  controlled  chemical  materials  and  other  services  in  the \nTintaya mining camp. These services  were necessary  due to some of the materials used in \nthe mines’ operations, such as sulphuric acid, having the potential to make illegal substances, \nincluding explosives.  \n\nThe agreement  also makes specific reference to  the  company’s adherence to the  Voluntary \nPrinciples  and  expressed  the  expectation  that  the  PNP  assigned  to  the  Tintaya  mine  would \nmake  the  same  commitment  to  those  Principles.  Any  suggestion  that  this  agreement \nfacilitated  “the  criminalisation  of  protest  by  allowing  police  to  make  arbitrary  arrests,  torture \nhuman rights defenders and journalists” and constitutes “a systematic abuse of power”, as per \npage  14  of  the  report,  is  simply  erroneous  and  fails  to  take  any  account  whatsoever  of  the \ntrue nature of this agreement. In any event, we note that the report has misquoted the Inter \nAmerican Commission on Human Rights in this respect. The Commission was in fact referring \nto the violation of the State of Emergency laws by the Peruvian government, which is clearly \nnothing to do with the agreement or the company. \n\nWe  strongly  deny  any  suggestion  that  Glencore  has  little  regard  for  the  human  rights  of \nEspinar’s  people  or  that  the  company  has  enjoyed  the  protection  of  public  services  of  the \nPNP  to  repress  groups  that  reject  our  projects  and  demand  compliance  with  human  rights \nnorms.  We  respect  the  rights  of  our  stakeholders  to  voice  their  concerns  regarding  our \nprojects  in  a  non-violent  way.  We  have  in  no  way  acted  to  prevent  demonstrations  taking \nplace  at  our  operations. We  remain  committed  to  engaging  in  constructive  dialogue  with  all \nour  stakeholders  to  address  any  concerns  and  to  ensure  our  activities  and  significant \ninvestments continue to contribute to the long-term social and economic development of the \nprovince for the benefit of all. \n\nCoal  \nGlencore  recognises  that  climate  change  issues  are  part  of  the  political,  societal  and \nregulatory  landscape  in  which  we  operate.  We  believe  that  effective  climate  change  policy \nmust be informed by the realities of global energy demand and supply and balance the social \nand economic aspirations of countries and their citizens. \n\nWe recognise that energy is one of the fundamental building blocks of modern life and a key \nenabler  of  economic  and  social  progress.  The  need  for  access  to  secure,  reliable  and \naffordable energy is universal. \n\nGlencore is a member of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network (AIGN) whose stated \naim is to  \n\n“AIGN is a network of industry associations and individual businesses which \ncontribute to the climate change policy debate and see value in joint industry action \non climate change in order to promote sustainable industry development.” \n\nThe  AIGN  is  one  of  a  range  of  industry  stakeholders  which  provides  feedback  and \nsuggestions to Government on the topic of climate change.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\fWe object to the allegation that prior to its acquisition by Glencore, Xstrata Australia was part \nof the self-proclaimed ‘greenhouse mafia’. Xstrata never claimed to be part of any so called \n‘greenhouse mafia’, we consider this to be a derogative term was used by a member of the \nGreens party and a journalist in Australia. \n\nLike  many  companies  with  a  presence  in  Australia,  Xstrata  participated  in  public  policy \ndiscussions in Australia on the topic of climate change, carbon pricing and renewable energy \ntargets.  On  a  number  of  occasions,  Xstrata  expressed  valid  concerns  about  the  design  of \nproposed  policies  in  Australia  (CPRS  and  CEA)  and  the  potential  for  carbon  leakage  and \nnegative impacts on Australia’s trade competitiveness.  \n\nThe comments attributed to Xstrata Coal’s senior management team have been taken out of \ncontext  and  are  a  misrepresentation  of  their  views.  Peter  Freyberg’s  statement  that  taking \naction  on  coal  would  “cost  jobs  and  move  investment  offshore”  was  made  to  support  his \nthoughts on the possible negative impacts of a poorly and/or flawed designed climate change \npolicy. Mr Coates was one of a number of senior business people and stakeholders asked to \nprovide  feedback  to  the  Australian  Government  on  climate  change  matters.  It  is  totally \nincorrect  of  the  report  to  claim  that  Mr  Coates  “warned”  the  government  away  from  climate \nleadership. \n\nGlencore  is  a  member  of  a  number  of  industry  associations,  which  are  disclosed  on  its \nwebsite.  These  organisations  promote  the  view  of  industry,  providing  decision-makers  with \nthe opportunity to hear all sides of the story. Both Glencore and Xstrata have been present at \na  number  of  UNFCCC  Climate  Talks  over  the  years  as  a  legitimate  participant  and  an \nobserver of UNFCCC discussions. These talks are conducted in a public forum, are open to \nany  registered  delegate  either  as  a  company  or  as  a  member  of  a  recognised  industry \nassociation and are freely reported on by the media.  \n\nCarbon Capture and Storage  (CCS) is recognised by the International Energy Agency (IEA) \nas  an  important  low  emission  technology  that  will  be  required  to  significantly  reduce  global \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions.  It  is  entirely  appropriate  for  Glencore  to  support  the  further \ndevelopment and deployment of CCS technology. \n\nWe are disappointed by the incorrect claims made by the report, implying that Glencore is \n“actively and aggressively lobbying for false solutions to climate change through its myriad of \nshady lobby groups”. We have been and continue to be a constructive and informed \nparticipant on climate change policy issues. We take a legitimate interest in policy \ndevelopments on climate change and the potential impact these may have on our business, \nincluding from a compliance perspective. Our membership and presence in these discussions \nis transparent as are any submissions we make on these issues or comments made in our \npublic reporting."}

Tras  la  decisión  del  Estado  peruano  de \nprivatizar  esta  operación,  Magma  Copper  Co  adquirió  la  mina  en  1994  por  medio  de  una \nsubasta  pública  internacional.  En  1996,  Magma  Copper  fue  adquirida  por  Broken  Hill \nProprietary (BHP), empresa que, a su vez, se fusionó con Billiton en 2001 y que dio origen a \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

En mayo de 2006, Xstrata adquirió Tintaya de BHP Billiton. En mayo de 2013, \nGlencore adquirió Xstrata y es el actual operador del activo Tintaya-Antapaccay. \n\nAl momento de la compra de Tintaya por parte de Xstrata, los recursos minerales de la mina \nestaban  casi  agotados  y  se  había  previsto  el  cierre  de  sus  operaciones  para  2013.  Xstrata \ndestinó considerables inversiones a la exploración de las zonas aledañas con el objetivo de \nmantener  las  operaciones  de  explotación  y  procesamiento  de  mineral  en  la  provincia  de \nEspinar para el beneficio mutuo de la comunidad y la empresa. \n\nEn  2010,  el directorio de  Xstrata aprobó  una inversión  de  $1.470 millones para prolongar  y \nampliar  las  operaciones  por  medio  del  desarrollo  del  yacimiento  satélite  Antapaccay. \nActualmente, la moderna operación minera, de gran escala, Antapaccay, emplea tecnología \nde punta, aplica una gestión ambiental líder y ha prolongado las operaciones mineras en, al \nmenos,  18  años  a  una  mayor  tasa  de  producción,  lo  que  genera  importantes  beneficios \neconómicos  y  sociales  para  la  región  del  Cusco  y  específicamente  la  provincia  de  Espinar. \nTintaya cesó sus actividades en 2013. \n\nEl Convenio Marco \nDurante sus años de operación, Tintaya fue objeto de una serie de conflictos con pobladores \nlocales;  el  21  de  mayo  1990,  manifestantes  invadieron  el  campamento  minero  por  primera \nvez. Desde entonces, el 21 mayo se ha convertido en una fecha simbólica para las protestas \nde  los  pobladores  en  contra  de  la  operación  minera  y  en  esa  fecha  o  en  torno  a  ella  se \nsuscitaron  protestas  en  los  años  2000,  2003  y  2005  y  más  recientemente,  en  2012.  El \nanterior alcalde de Espinar, Sr. Oscar Mollohuanca, participó en las protestas de 2000 y 2012 \ncomo  alcalde  y  de  2005  como  asesor  del  Frente  Único  de  Defensa  de  los  Intereses  de \nEspinar (FUDIE). \n\nEn  2002,  se  instauró  una  mesa  de  diálogo  para  investigar  los  reclamos  de  la  comunidad \nsobre  expropiación  de  tierras,  contaminación  ambiental  y  derechos  humanos.  La  mesa \nestuvo  integrada  por  representantes  de  seis  comunidades  locales  del  área  de  influencia \ndirecta de la mina, de Tintaya y de las organizaciones no gubernamentales Oxfam Americas, \nConicami y Cooperacción. \n\nEl  3  septiembre  de  2003,  BHP  Billiton  suscribió  el  Convenio  Marco  con  las  autoridades \nprovinciales  de  Espinar.  En  virtud  de  este  convenio,  Tintaya  y  posteriormente  Antapaccay \nrealiza  una  contribución  anual  del  3%  de  sus  utilidades  antes  de  impuestos  para  el \nfinanciamiento de proyectos de mejoramiento social, en beneficio de las 70 comunidades de \nla provincia de Espinar, entre otros compromisos. \n\nDesde la adquisición de mina Tintaya a BHP Billiton, Xstrata, y posteriormente Glencore, ha \ncumplido  plenamente  con  sus  obligaciones  en  virtud  del  convenio  marco  y,  en  muchos \naspectos,  incluso  con  obligaciones  más  estrictas  que  las  estipuladas  en  el  convenio.    La \nempresa  dio  solución  a  los  reclamos  discutidos  en  el  marco  de  la  Mesa  de  Diálogo.  Como \nresultado de ello, en 2011, se acordó cambiar el nombre de la Mesa de Diálogo  a Mesa de \nDesarrollo, un cambio que reflejó la transición de un mecanismo abocado a gestionar pasivos \noriginados por actividades mineras históricas a uno dedicado a promover el desarrollo local. \nBajo nuestra gestión, se resolvieron todas las quejas  relativas a expropiación de tierras y se \nacordó disolver la comisión conformada para abordar los reclamos sobre esta materia.  \n\nEl  Convenio  Marco,  en  virtud  del  cual  se  realizan  cerca  del  70%  de  nuestros  aportes \nvoluntarios, es supervisado por una asamblea general conformada por 37 organizaciones. En \nel  comité  de  gestión,  que  consta  de  ocho  integrantes,  Tintaya-Antapaccay  posee  un \nrepresentante,  hay  dos  autoridades  locales,  tres  representantes  de  organizaciones  de  la \nsociedad civil y dos de la comunidad local. El presupuesto del Convenio Marco se distribuye \nentre megaproyectos (20%) y proyectos de distrito (80%). En el último caso, el presupuesto \nse  divide  entre  los  ocho  distritos  que  conforman  la  provincia  de  Espinar  sobre  la  base  del \ntamaño de la población (80%) y de los indicadores de pobreza (30%) de cada distrito. Luego, \nlos  miembros  de  la  comunidad  participan  en  talleres  para  decidir  qué  proyectos  deberían \nimplementarse  conforme  al  presupuesto.  Desde  su  creación,  Tintaya  Antapaccay  ha \naportado  más  de  USD  97  millones  por  medio  de  este  mecanismo,  que  ha  permitido \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fimplementar importantes proyectos de infraestructura, tales como el hospital de Espinar, una \nplanta de lácteos, el Centro de Recursos Educativos de Espinar y, recientemente, una planta \nprocesadora de fibra de alpaca. Además, ha financiado más de 800 proyectos comunitarios \nde menor tamaño en la región. \n\nSuperamos  los  compromisos  asumidos  en  virtud  del  Convenio  Marco  para  permitir  que  el \n70%  de  la  mano  de  obra  no  calificada,  tanto  directa  como  directa,  provenga  de  las \ncomunidades locales. En la nueva mina Antapaccay, aumentamos la utilización de mano de \nobra local no calificada a un 100%. Gracias a los programas de capacitación y adquisiciones \nque hemos dispuesto, Tintaya-Antapaccay también ha facilitado el lanzamiento de cerca de \n70 proveedores locales que prestan servicios, tales como catering, instalaciones eléctricas y \nmantenimiento. \n\nDesde la adquisición de Tintaya, nos hemos abocado sin cesar a velar por que el Convenio \nMarco  sea  gestionado  de  manera  eficaz  y  genere  proyectos  sostenibles  para  proporcionar \nbeneficios de largo plazo a las comunidades ubicadas en la provincia de Espinar. Desde la \nsuscripción  del acuerdo, en 2003, se han concretado más de 800 proyectos  acordados por \nlas  comunidades  y  las  autoridades  de  Espinar,  entre  ellos,  diversos  proyectos  de \ninfraestructura, de gran escala, que benefician a una serie de distritos de la provincia. Cada \nuno  de  estos  proyectos  fueron  definidos,  desarrollados  e  implementados  por  un  comité  de \ngestión  conformado  por  representantes  de  la  municipalidad  provincial  (que  lo  preside \nactualmente) y las municipalidades distritales de Espinar, organizaciones de la sociedad civil, \nentre ellas, FUDIE (Frente Único de Defensa de los Intereses de Espinar), las comunidades y \nTintaya-Antapaccay. La estructura actual asegura un  punto de equilibrio  importante entre  el \ngobierno,  las  organizaciones  no  gubernamentales,  los  representantes  de  la  comunidad  y  el \nsector  privado  y  —creemos—  ha  sido  un  factor  importante  para  que  el  Convenio  Marco \nejecute  los  proyectos  de  manera  más  eficiente  y  eficaz  que  muchos  otros  fondos  de \ndesarrollo social en Perú. \n\nHemos  seguido  efectuando  inversiones  significativas  en  desarrollo  social  y  comunitario. \nDesde  nuestra  adquisición  de  Tintaya,  en  2006,  hemos  efectuado  aportes  voluntarios \ncercanos  a  USD  82  millones  en  virtud  del  Convenio  Marco  y  de  casi  USD  93  millones \nmediante  otros  mecanismos  de  donación,  además  de  realizar  pagos  sustanciales  por \nconcepto de impuestos y regalías, que suman más de $915 millones para el mismo período.  \n\nEl Convenio  Marco es una iniciativa eficaz  y muy positiva entre la empresa, la  provincia de \nEspinar  y  las  comunidades,  que  ha  generado  beneficios  tangibles  y  sostenibles  para  las \ncomunidades locales durante varios años. Dialogamos continuamente con las comunidades, \nlas organizaciones representativas y las autoridades provinciales de Espinar para abordar la \nmanera de colaborar en pos del mejoramiento del Convenio Marco. \n\nUna activa gestión ambiental  \nRechazamos categóricamente las acusaciones de contaminación ambiental en contra de las \nminas  Tintaya  o  Antapaccay.  Nuestras  operaciones  cumplen  plenamente  con  todas  las \nnormativas  ambientales  y  sociales.  Nuestras  operaciones  realizan  monitoreos  ambientales \nde  manera  periódica  y  se  someten  a  auditorías,  tanto  internas  como  externas,  con  el \npropósito de evaluar el desempeño ambiental de nuestras instalaciones. \n\nMedio \n\nEn los últimos años, se han realizado dos estudios ambientales independientes para analizar \nla presencia de metales pesados en  los cursos de aguas,  suelos  y  habitantes  de las  zonas \nde  captación  de  las  minas  Tintaya  y  Antapaccay.  El  primer  estudio  sobre  salud  de  la \ncomunidad fue realizado, en 2010, por el Centro Nacional de Salud Ocupacional y Protección \nSalud \ndel \n(Censopas) del Instituto Nacional de Salud de Perú,  en el marco de un estudio de línea  de \nbase  del  proyecto  minero  Quechua,  propiedad  de  otra  empresa,  situado  a  10  km  aguas \narriba  de  mina  Tintaya.  El  segundo  estudio  fue  patrocinado  por  dos  ONG,  la  alemana \nMisereor  y  la  Vicaría  de  la  Solidaridad  de  Perú,  y  fue  realizado  por  la  estudiante  alemana \nEike Hümpel en 2011. Debe señalarse que la metodología aplicada en este estudio presenta \ngraves  defectos  y  no  considera  las  características  geológicas  de  la  zona,  tales  como  la \n\nAmbiente \n\npara \n\nla \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fmineralización  propia  de  las  condiciones  naturales  de  la  región,  que  incluye  metales \npesados.  \n\nNinguno  de  los  informes  afirma  que  Tintaya-Antapaccay  sea  causante  de  la  presencia  de \nmetales pesados en el área. Ambos informes fueron mal utilizados por el alcalde anterior de \nEspinar,  Sr.  Oscar  Mollohuanca,  por  organizaciones  no  gubernamentales  y  de  la  sociedad \ncivil  y  por  miembros  del  parlamento  peruano  como  prueba  de  que  Tintaya-Antapaccay \ncontamina el medio ambiente. Este supuesto erróneo fue difundido ampliamente en la prensa \nperuana y sin duda alguna contribuyó a recrudecer las tensiones entre los pobladores locales \nantes  de  las  protestas  de  mayo  de  2012.  De  hecho,  la  comisión  de  ética  del  Congreso  del \nPerú lanzó una investigación en contra de una parlamentaria por utilizar el estudio de 2010 \npara acusar a mina Tintaya de contaminación, parlamentaria que posteriormente debió emitir \nuna retractación.  \n\nLa mina Tintaya-Antapaccay está situada en una zona que presenta en forma natural suelos \naltamente mineralizados, pues se encuentra sobre la faja de cobre Yauri-Andahuaylas, en la \ncual se ha realizado  minería artesanal  y  pequeña minería  desde tiempos ancestrales hasta \nhoy.  Tintaya  Antapaccay  utiliza  un  sistema  de  circuito  cerrado  para  la  gestión  del  recurso \nhídrico y no vierte agua de la mina al medio ambiente, si bien está autorizada para hacerlo. \nTintaya Antapaccay no utiliza ni extrae plomo, arsénico o mercurio en sus operaciones.  \n\nSometemos nuestro desempeño ambiental a numerosas auditorías internas  y externas. Los \norganismos  reguladores  peruanos  (anteriormente,  Osinergmin,  una  institución  pública \nencargada de supervisar las inversiones en los sectores de minería y energía y, actualmente, \nOEFA,  el  organismo  de  evaluación  y  fiscalización  ambiental  de  Perú),  en  los  últimos  años, \nhan tomado cientos de  muestras  y realizado diversos programas de monitoreo  en el marco \nde  sus  facultades  fiscalizadoras  y  no  han  detectado  ninguna  evidencia  de  contaminación. \nHasta  la  fecha,  todas  las  actividades  de  monitoreo  reglamentarias  y  participativas  han \ndemostrado  que  Tintaya-Antapaccay  opera  conforme  a  la  legislación  peruana  y  siempre \nhemos  rechazado  las  acusaciones  de  contaminación  ambiental  en  contra  de  nuestras \noperaciones Tintaya-Antapaccay. \n\nIndependientemente  del  lugar,  siempre  procuramos  garantizar  un  amplio  apoyo  para \nnuestras  actividades.  Ello  quedó  demostrado  en  el  contundente  apoyo  comunitario  que \nrecibimos  con  ocasión  del  proceso  de  consulta  pública  sobre  la  evaluación  de  impacto \nambiental del proyecto de ampliación de Antapaccay. Actualmente, Tintaya-Antapaccay lleva \na cabo un monitoreo participativo de sus operaciones y sectores aledaños con la comunidad \ny las autoridades peruanas.  \n\nLas tensiones sociales de 2012 \nEstábamos fuertemente preocupados por la escalada de los actos de protesta en hechos de \nviolencia en Espinar a fines de mayo de 2012. En ese entonces, Tintaya-Antapaccay señaló \nal alcalde Mollohuanca que, si bien no le era posible cumplir con la demanda de aumentar su \naporte en virtud del convenio marco de un 3% a un 30%, estaba abierta a discutir mejoras al \nconvenio, por ejemplo, en materia del aumento del compromiso de contratación de personas \nlocales  en  nuestras  operaciones.  Pese  a  estos  intentos  de  mantener  el  diálogo  con  las \ncomunidades  y  lograr  una  solución  pacífica,  y  al  acuerdo  previo  del  gobierno  nacional  de \nrealizar  otro  monitoreo  ambiental  conjunto  intensivo  en  la  provincia,  las  protestas  siguieron \nadelante.  \n\nDurante  las  protestas  nos  preocupó  fuertemente  la  seguridad  de  nuestros  trabajadores \npropios  y  contratistas  en  la  región  y  de  las  comunidades  locales  de  Espinar.  No  toleramos \nninguna  forma  de  violencia  y  estamos  comprometidos  con  el  respeto  a  los  derechos \nhumanos de nuestros trabajadores y miembros de la comunidad en la región. \n\nEstamos  profundamente  comprometidos  con  el  respeto  a  los  derechos  humanos.  En  todos \nlos  lugares  en  que  ejercemos  nuestro  quehacer,  nos  relacionamos  activamente  con  las \ncomunidades  locales  con  el  fin  de  entablar  un  diálogo  constructivo  y  prestamos  especial \natención  a  minimizar  todo  riesgo  de  abuso  a  los  derechos  humanos  por  parte  de  nuestros \ntrabajadores  propios,  contratistas  o  proveedores  de  servicios  de  seguridad.  En  nuestras \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\finstalaciones  situadas  en  regiones  consideradas  de  alto  riesgo,  aplicamos  los  Principios \nVoluntarios  de  Seguridad  y  Derechos  Humanos  de  las  Naciones  Unidas  (Principios \nVoluntarios) como guía para el uso de servicios de seguridad privada y la interacción con el \npersonal de servicio público. Las metodologías que aplicamos para la evaluación de riesgos \nlos  Principios  Voluntarios.  Dialogamos \ny  capacitación  se  encuentran  en \nactivamente con los gobiernos locales para  sensibilizar acerca de los  Principios  Voluntarios \ncomo una norma de buena práctica internacional en el ámbito de la seguridad y los derechos \nhumanos. \n\nlínea  con \n\nExigimos a todas nuestras instalaciones realizar evaluaciones de riesgo  sobre los derechos \nhumanos que estén en línea con  los  Principios  Voluntarios.  En  el caso de  las  instalaciones \nsituadas  en  regiones  consideradas  de  alto  riesgo,  como  Perú,  las  evaluaciones  de  riesgo \nsobre  derechos  humanos  se  realizan  anualmente;  este  es  el  enfoque  aplicado  en  Tintaya-\nAntapaccay.    Además,  Tintaya-Antapaccay  colabora  activamente  con  Socios  Perú,  una  red \nlocal conformada por diversas organizaciones que trabaja con el gobierno para promover los \nPrincipios  Voluntarios,  compartir  aprendizajes  y  mejores  prácticas  con  otros  actores  en  el \npaís.  \n\nIncorporamos los derechos humanos a la evaluación inicial de riesgos asociados al proyecto \nefectuada  para  el  proyecto  de  ampliación  de  Antapaccay.  La  evaluación  de  riesgos \ncontempló  una  revisión  de  la  fuerza  del  Estado  de  Derecho,  el  potencial  de  conflicto  y  los \ndesafíos y posibles impactos para las comunidades locales. \n\nComo parte de nuestro compromiso con los derechos humanos, todos nuestros trabajadores \npropios  y  contratistas  de  Tintaya-Antapaccay  reciben  capacitación  en  derechos  humanos. \nHasta  la  fecha,  más  de  5000  personas,  entre  ellas,  contratistas  de  la  construcción  del \nproyecto de ampliación de Antapaccay,  han participado en programas de sensibilización en \nderechos humanos. Todo el personal de seguridad que labora en Tintaya-Antapaccay recibe \nformación  sobre  nuestras  políticas  y  procedimientos  internos  en  materia  de  derechos \nhumanos. \n\nNuestra relación con la policía \nLos  autores  del \ninforme  Conquistadores  corporativos  han  entendido  de  manera \nprofundamente  equivocada  la  relación  que  existe  entre  Tintaya-Antapaccay  y  la  Policía \nNacional  del  Perú  (PNP).  Es  incorrecto  afirmar  que  la  PNP  actuó  como  la  fuerza  de \nseguridad privada de la empresa o en representación de la empresa durante las protestas de \nmayo de 2012. En todo momento durante las protestas de mayo 2012, la PNP actuó bajo las \nórdenes  de  su  cadena  de  mando  y  bajo  el  control  y  la  autoridad  del  gobierno  peruano. \nTintaya Antapaccay no intentó dirigir (y, en cualquier caso, no tendría la capacidad para ello) \nla respuesta de la PNP en las protestas. \n\nSi bien el informe Conquistadores corporativos es correcto en señalar que existía un acuerdo \nentre la PNP y la empresa de fecha 16 mayo  de 2011, es claro que ni los autores de dicho \ninforme,  ni  los  autores  del  informe  titulado  “Policía  Mercenaria  al  Servicio  de  las  Empresas \nMineras” (citado en la nota 16 al pie de página), tuvieron a la vista el acuerdo pertinente. En \nconsecuencia, ninguno de los autores mencionados se encuentra en una posición adecuada \npara  comprender  o  referirse  al  contenido  o  propósito  de  dicho  acuerdo.  A  continuación, \nclarificamos la naturaleza y el alcance de dicho acuerdo. \n\nEl acuerdo se ejecutó en concordancia con la ley peruana, el Decreto Supremo N° 019-71/IN, \nel  Decreto  Supremo  N°  053-2005-PCM,  el  Decreto  Ley  N°  25707  y  la  Ley  N°  28305,  el \nDecreto  Supremo  N°086-92-PCM,  aprobado  por  el  Decreto  Supremo  N°053-2005-PCM.  En \nconcordancia  con  dichas  disposiciones  legales,  el  acuerdo  contemplaba  servicios  policiales \ncomplementarios  extraordinarios  en  asuntos  de  vigilancia  y  seguridad,  inspección  y  control \nde  materiales  químicos  controlados  y  otros  servicios  en  el  campamento  minero  Tintaya. \nEstos  servicios  eran  necesarios  debido  a  que  algunos  de  los  materiales  utilizados  en  las \noperaciones  de  las  minas,  tales  como  el  ácido  sulfúrico,  podían  utilizarse  para  fabricar \nsustancias ilegales, entre ellas, explosivos.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEste  acuerdo  también  efectúa  una  referencia  específica  a  la  adhesión  de  la  empresa  a  los \nPrincipios Voluntarios y expresa el deseo de que la PNP asignada a mina Tintaya asuma el \nmismo  compromiso  con  dichos  principios.  Cualquier  sugerencia  respecto  de  que  este \nacuerdo  haya  servido  “para  criminalizar  la  protesta,  pues  permite  a  la  policía  hacer \ndetenciones arbitrarias, torturas a defensores y periodistas”, y constituya “un sistemático uso \nabusivo  de  la  fuerza”,  tal  como  se  señala  en  la  página  14  del  informe,  es  simplemente \nequivocado  y  no  tiene  cuenta  alguna  de  la  verdadera  naturaleza  de  este  acuerdo.    En \ncualquier  caso,  observamos  que  el \nla  Comisión \nInteramericana de Derechos Humanos en esta materia. La Comisión se refería, de hecho, a \nla violación de la legislación del estado de emergencia por parte del Estado peruano, lo que \nclaramente no tiene que ver con el acuerdo o con la empresa. \n\nincorrectamente  a \n\ninforme  cita \n\nNegamos enérgicamente toda sugerencia de que Glencore tenga poca consideración de los \nderechos  humanos  de  los  pobladores  de  Espinar  o  que  la  empresa  haya  disfrutado  de  la \nprotección  de  los  servicios  públicos  por  parte  de  la  PNP  para  reprimir  a  los  grupos  que \nrechazan  nuestros  proyectos  y  demandan  el  cumplimiento  de  las  normas  de  derechos \nhumanos.  Respetamos  los  derechos  de  nuestros  grupos  de  interés  de  expresar  sus \ninquietudes  sobre  nuestros  proyectos  de  manera  no  violenta.  No  intervenimos  de  manera \nalguna para impedir las manifestaciones que ocurrían en nuestras operaciones. Mantenemos \nnuestro  compromiso  de  entablar  un  diálogo  constructivo  con  todos  nuestros  grupos  de \ninterés  para responder a las inquietudes  y asegurar  que  nuestras  actividades e inversiones \nsignificativas  continúen  contribuyendo  al  desarrollo  social  y  económico  de  largo  plazo  de  la \nprovincia para el beneficio de todos. \n\nEl carbón \nGlencore reconoce que  los desafíos relativos  al cambio climático forman parte del contexto \npolítico, social y regulatorio en el que debe desenvolverse. Creemos que una política eficaz \nen  materia  de  cambio  climático  debe  fundarse  en  las  realidades  de  la  oferta  y  la  demanda \nmundial  de  energía  y  encontrar  un  justo  equilibrio  entre  las  aspiraciones  sociales  y \neconómicas de los países y sus ciudadanos. \n\nReconocemos que la energía es uno de los componentes fundamentales de la vida moderna \ny un catalizador clave del progreso económico  y social. La necesidad de acceder a fuentes \nde energía seguras, confiables y a un costo abordable es universal. \n\nGlencore es miembro de la Australian Industry Greenhouse Network (AIGN o red australiana \nde la industria para reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero), la cual ha \ndeclarado el siguiente propósito:  \n\n“AIGN es una red de asociaciones de la industria y empresas individuales, que \ncontribuye al debate acerca de las políticas sobre cambio climático y que aprecia el \nvalor de una acción conjunta de la industria en materia de cambio climático con el fin \nde promover un desarrollo sostenible de la industria”. \n\nAIGN  es  uno  de  los  numerosos  actores  de  la  industria  que  efectúan  observaciones  y \nsugerencias al gobierno respecto del cambio climático.  \n\nRechazamos  la  acusación  de  que,  previamente  a  ser  adquirida  por  Glencore,  Xstrata \nAustralia haya sido parte del grupo autoproclamado como “Greenhouse Mafia” (la mafia del \nefecto  invernadero).  Xstrata  nunca  ha  afirmado  ser  parte  de  ningún  grupo  denominado \n“Greenhouse Mafia”. Nos parece que ese es un término despectivo, que fue utilizado por un \nmiembro del partido Greens y un periodista en Australia. \n\nComo  muchas  empresas  con  presencia  en  Australia,  Xstrata  participó  en  el  debate  sobre \npolíticas  públicas  en  Australia  en  materia  de  las  metas  sobre  el  cambio  climático,  la \ntarificación  del  carbón  y  las  energías  renovables.  En  muchas  ocasiones,  Xstrata  expresó \npreocupaciones válidas acerca del  diseño de  las políticas propuestas en  Australia (CPRS  y \nCEA) y sobre la posibilidad de fugas de carbono e impactos negativos para la competitividad \ncomercial de Australia. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\finexacta  de \n\ninterpretación \n\nLos  comentarios  atribuidos  al  equipo  de  alta  dirección  de  Xstrata  Coal  fueron  sacados  de \ncontexto  y  constituyen  una \nlas  opiniones  vertidas.  Las \ndeclaraciones  de  Peter  Freyberg  en  el  sentido  de  que  adoptar  medidas  contra  el  carbón \npodría  “costar  puestos  de  trabajo  y  ahuyentar  las  inversiones  hacia  afuera  de  Australia” \nfueron  hechas  para  apoyar  su  reflexión  sobre  los  posibles  impactos  negativos  que  podría \nacarrear una política mal diseñada o diseñada defectuosamente para el cambio climático. El \nSr.  Coates  fue  uno  de  los  muchos  altos  empresarios  y  actores  interesados  a  quienes  se \nsolicitó entregar retroalimentación al gobierno australiano sobre asuntos de cambio climático. \nEs  absolutamente  incorrecto  lo  señalado  en  el  informe  de  que  el  Sr.  Coates  habría \n“advertido” al gobierno que se mantuviera lejos del liderazgo climático. \n\nGlencore  es  miembro  de  una  serie  de  asociaciones  de  la  industria,  que  se  encuentran \nmencionadas  en  su  sitio  web.  Estas  organizaciones  promueven  la  visión  de  la  industria \nofreciendo  a  los  encargados  de  tomar  decisiones  la  oportunidad  de  escuchar  todas  las \naristas  de  la  historia.  A  lo  largo  de  los  años,  tanto  Glencore  como  Xstrata  han  estado \npresentes  en  varias  de  las  Conversaciones  sobre  el  Clima  sostenidas  por  la  Convención \nMarco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC) en calidad de legítimo \nparticipante  y  observador  de  las  discusiones  de  la  CMNUCC.  Estas  conversaciones  se \ndesarrollan  en  un  foro  público,  son  abiertas  a  todos  los  delegados  acreditados,  ya  sean \nempresas o miembros de una asociación reconocida de la industria, y se informa libremente \nacerca de ellas en los medios. \n\nLa captura  y el almacenamiento del carbono (CCS,  por sus siglas en  inglés) es reconocida \npor  la  Agencia  Internacional  de  la  Energía  (AIE)  como  una  tecnología  importante  de  baja \nemisión,  que  se  requerirá  para  reducir  significativamente  las  emisiones  de  gases  de  efecto \ninvernadero  a  nivel  mundial.  Es  absolutamente  apropiado  que  Glencore  apoye  el  futuro \ndesarrollo y utilización de la tecnología CCS. \n\nDeploramos las afirmaciones incorrectas que se efectúan en el informe en las que se implica \nque Glencore “está activa y agresivamente promoviendo sus falsas soluciones a la crisis \nclimática a través de su gran cantidad de grupos de cabildeo ocultos en las sombras”. Hemos \nsido y continuamos siendo un participante constructivo e informado en materia de política de \ncambio climático. Tenemos un interés legítimo en lo relativo al desarrollo de políticas sobre \ncambio climático y en el posible impacto que estas puedan tener sobre nuestra empresa, por \nejemplo, desde la perspectiva del cumplimiento. Nuestra participación y presencia en estas \ndiscusiones es transparente, así como lo son todas las observaciones que hemos efectuado \nsobre estas materias o los comentarios que hemos incluido en nuestros informes públicos."}

A  Vale  em  Moçambique, \npor  sua  escala  e  por  haver  se  concretizado  como  um  projeto  importante  para  a  economia  do \npaís, assume também o compromisso de contribuir para o desenvolvimento das comunidades \nlocais e para a melhoria de seus indicadores sociais. \n\nPara a implantação da Mina Carvão Moatize, cuja operação teve início em 2011, foi necessário \nrealizar  um  programa  detalhado  de  reassentamento  das  famílias  que  viviam  nas  áreas \nindustriais e de lavra. O projeto de reassentamento foi baseado em procedimentos e diretrizes \ninternas da empresa que visam a o respeito e observância aos direitos humanos, tais como a \nNorma  de  Remoção  Involuntária,  o  Manual  de  Relação  com  Comunidades  para  Projetos  de \nCapital,  o  Guia  de  Relacionamento  com  Comunidades  e  o  Procedimento  de  Remoção \nInvoluntária, documentos elaborados à luz das diretrizes internacionais, especialmente aquelas \ndefinidas pelo Banco Mundial e IFC – International Finance Corporation. \n\nEste  programa  começou  em  2006  e  contou  com  o  diálogo  social  com  o  governo  e \ncomunidades. A etapa de transferência das famílias foi concluída em 2010, com a realocação \nde  1.365  famílias  em  dois  reassentamentos,  Cateme,  com  características  rurais,  e  25  de \nsetembro, com características urbanas. A Vale está empenhada no desenvolvimento de ações \nde  apoio  a  essas  famílias,  em  conjunto  com  as  esferas  governamentais,  para  atender  às \nnecessidades das comunidades reassentadas. \n\nAs famílias reassentadas em Cateme receberam 0,8 hectare de terreno onde está implantada a \nsua residência. Para além deste, cada família recebeu 1 hectare de terra  totalmente destinada \nà produção agrícola, além de verba destinada a  potencializar a capacidade produtiva dessas \nfamílias, conforme demanda das próprias famílias e do Governo.  \n\nQuanto  à  assistência  alimentar  regular,  as  famílias  que  optaram  pelo  reassentamento  rural \nreceberam  pacotes  de  alimentos  referentes  à  quebra  no  ciclo  produtivo  de  suas  machambas. \nForam  distribuídos  três  pacotes  de  alimentos,  levando  em  consideração  a  produção  máxima \nque a área de machamba de cada família poderia alcançar. Desde que as famílias passaram a \ncultivar  nas  novas  machambas,  foram  introduzidas  técnicas  para  aumentar  a  produtividade, \ncomo  sementes  melhoradas,  fomento  da  tração  animal,  uso  de  inseticidas  naturais,  fomento \npecuário  de  gado,  melhoramento  genético  de  gado  e  fomento  da  produção  de  frangos.  Além \ndisso,  houve  a  distribuição  de  sete  mudas  de  fruteiras  para  cada  família,  um  total  de  14  mil \nunidades  e,  também,  apoio  técnico  permanente  de  uma  equipe  de  34  profissionais  para \norientar a atividade agrícola. \n\nPara  o  reforço  da  capacidade  agrícola,  a  Vale  disponibiliza  técnicos  e  trabalha  com \nextensionistas  agrários  do  Governo  na  assistência  às  famílias  em  técnicas  de  aumento  da \nprodutividade da terra. Entre outros projectos agrícolas, a Vale apoia: \n\nCampanha agrícola – disponibilizando sementes melhoradas que são canalizada aos Serviços \nDistritais  de  Actividades  Económicas  (SDAE)  que,  por  sua  vez,  disponibiliza  à  comunidade  a \num preço subsidiado através de agrodeallers. \n\nFomento de culturas de rendimento – Disponibilizando mais de 100 hectares em regime de \nsequeiro para fomento das culturas de rendimento, com 87,5 hectares de terras aráveis.  \n\nA  segurança  alimentar  tem  sido  também  objeto  de  capacitações  em  avicultura,  horticultura, \nfinanças  rurais  (inicluindo  liderança  e  associativismo),  culturas  de  rendimento,  pomares \nresidenciais  e  tracção  animal.  No  total,  até  agora,  foram  treinados  1.  364  moradores  do \nreassentamento, sendo que destes, 58% são mulheres.  \n\n1\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \n \n \n\fA  fim  de  fomentar  outras  possibilidades  de  profissionalização  e  geração  de  renda  para  esta \npopulação, a Vale vem oferecendo treinamentos em outras modalidades como capacitação de \nalfabetizadores;  capacitação  de  professores  e  alunos  em  carpintaria,  eletricidade  e  contrução \ncivil  básica;  pedreiro;  restaurante  e  bar;  corte  e  costura;  gestão  de  negócios;  corte  e  costura; \nempreendedorismo  feminino;  poupança  e  empréstimo;  associativismo,  etc.  Mais  de  2.255 \npessoas participaram do conjunto de treinamentos oferecidos pela Vale até agora.  \n\nEm relação às questões envolvendo água e irrigação dos reassentamentos, a Vale concluiu a \nreabilitação  do  sistema  de  abastecimento  de  água  existente  em  Cateme,  revendo  os \nequipamentos  e  condicionando-os  para  um  pleno  funcionamento.  Esta  iniciativa  incluiu \natividades  como  substituição  de  dois  depósitos  elevados  de  10  mil  litros;  colocação  de  três \nbóias  elétricas  nas  torres  elevadas;  substituição  de  bombas  pressurizadoras  e  fontanários; \nsubstituição  de  duas  eletrobombas  submersíveis  nos  poços;  e  implantação  do  projeto  de \nirrigação  gota  a  gota,  envolvendo  100  famílias  para  a  produção  de  horticulas,  iniciado  em  \njunho de 2013. \n\nA Vale também construiu um sistema de abastecimento e distribuição de água constituído por 4 \npoços  de  captação,  2  caixas  d´água  com  capacidade  de  40  m³  e  uma  cisterna  elevada  com \numa capacidade total de 500 m3. Estas fontes de água estão ligadas à rede de 34 fontanários, \natravés  de  11  km  de  tubulação  instalada  para  adução  e  distribuição  que  garante  maior \nautonomia, mesmo face à falta de energia elétrica. A Vale também financiou a construção de \nduas  represas  no  rio  Muaradzi,  que  atravessa  a  zona  de  Cateme.  Com  estas  represas,  os \nagricultores da comunidade reforçaram seu envolvimento em atividades agrícolas. Por forma a \nfacilitar  a  colecta  e  transporte  de  água,  a  Vale  distribuiu  em  Cateme  287  water  rollers  para  a \ncomunidade.  \n\nCom  respeito  a  melhorias  na  infraestrutura  local,  houve  a  reestruturação  e  manutenção  de \nestradas, drenagens e serviços de transporte e sociais. Além de construção de estrada de 8 km \ne  duas  pontes,  a  Vale  subsidiou  o  transporte  por  autocarros,  financiou  uma  escola  primária \nnova, uma escola secundária residencial, um centro de saúde e ambulância, além de local para \na  realização  de  mercado.  Foram  construídas  ainda  uma  casa  mãe  espera,  a  fim  de  impactar \npositivamente  sobre  a  saúde  materno-infantil,  uma  farmácia  pública.  Quanto  ao  investimento \nno acesso à eletricidade, a Vale reforçou e melhorou a  cablagem que transporta energia entre \nTete/Moatize/Cateme;  aumentou  a  rede  de  distribuição  por  todas  as  ruas  da  comunidade  de \nCateme,  incluindo  a  facilitação  da  ligação  entre  as  residências;  deu  provimento  à  iluminação \npública e estabeleceu uma estrutura de gestão da EDM na comunidade de Cateme. \n\n2"}

Vale in Mozambique, due to its scale \nand  its  implementation  of  an  important  project  for  the  country's  economy,  has  also  made  a \ncommitment to contribute to the development of local communities, as such, to the increase of \nopportunities and overall well-being of its members. \n\nAs  an  integral  part  of  the  implementation  of  the  Moatize  Coal  Mine,  which  began  operating  in \n2011, it was necessary to undertake a detailed resettlement program for the families living in the \nindustrial  and  mining  sites.  The  resettlement  process  was  based  on  Vale´s  internal  guidelines \nmeant  to  reinforce  the  observance  of  human  rights,  such  as  the  Resettlement  Norm  and \nProcedures and the Community Relations Guidelines. These documents are largely inspired by \ninternational  directives  such  as  those  defined  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation – IFC.  \n\nThis  program  started  in  2006  and  has  involved  social  dialogue  with  the  government  and \ncommunities.  The  family  transfer  stage  was  completed  in  2010,  following  the  resettlement  of \n1,365  families  to  two  areas:  the  rural  community  of  Cateme,  and  the  urban  district  of  25  de \nSetembro. Vale is dedicated to developing supporting these families, alongside the government, \nin order to meet the needs of the resettled communities. \n\nThe families resettled in Cateme receive a house in 0,8 hectare of land and 1 hectare foreseen \nto  agricultural  production.  Also,  they  have  received  cash  support  in  order  to  potentialize  the \nproduction of these families, as per demand of the families themselves and the governement.  \n\nRegarding  regular  food  assistance,  the  families  that  opted  for  rural  resettlement  received  food \npackages related to the loss of the production cycle on their plots of land. Three food packages \nwere  distributed,  taking  into  account  the  maximum  output  that  each  family's  plot  of  land  could \nhave produced. As the families have begun to cultivate their new plots of land, techniques have \nbeen  introduced  to  enhance  yields,  such  as  the  use  of  improved  seeds,  poultry  production, \nanimal traction, cattle herding and genetic improvement and the use of natural insecticides. In \naddition, seven fruit trees were distributed to each family, in a total of 14 units and permanent \ntechnical support of 34 professionals has been offered to guide the agriculture activities. These \ntechnicians work alongside government professionals in order to share techniques that enhance \nthe lands´ capacity and productivity: \n\n- Agricultural Campaign – Vale provides improved seeds that are channeled through the \nServiços Distritais de Atividades Econômicaas (SDAE). The prices of the seeds are subsidized \nto the communities via agro dealers. \n\n-  Support  to  subsistence  and  commercialization  agriculture  –  Vale  has  put  more  than \n\n100 hectares to the disposal of the community, among which 87,5 are arable.  \n\nFood  security  has  also  been  the  object  of  training  in  poultry,  horticulture,  rural  finances \n(including leadership and association), residential cultivation and animal traction. So far, 1.364 \nresettled individuals have been trained so far, 58% of which are women. \n\nIn  order  to  foment  other  possibilities  of  professionalization  and  income  generation  for  this \npopulation,  Vale  has  been  offering  training  in  other  modalities  such  as:  literacy  education, \ncarpentry for teachers and students, electricity and basic civil construction, masonry, business \nmanagement,  sewing,  women´s  entrepreneurship,  savings  and  landing,  etc.  More  than  2.255 \nresettled people have taken part on the trainings offered by Vale so far. \n\nIn relation to issues involving water and irrigation in the resettled communities, Vale has finished \nrehabilitating  the  existing  water  supply  systems  in  Cateme,  reviewing  equipment  and \nconditioning  it  in  order  to  work  fully.  This  initiative  included  activities  such  as  replacing  two \n10,000-litre raised tanks, installing three electric floats in elevated towers, replacing pressurized \n\n1\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fpumps  and  fountains,  replacing  two  submersible  electric  pumps  in  wells,  and  implementing  a \ndrip irrigation project involving 100 families to help them grow vegetables, initiated in June 2013. \n\nVale  has  also  built  a  water  supply  and  distribution  system  constituted  of  4  caption  wells,  2 \nreservoirs  with  the  capacity  of  40  m³  and  an  elevated  cistern  with  total  capacity  of  500  m3. \nThese  water  sources  are  linked  to  the  existing  network  of  34  fountains,  along  11  km  of  pipes \noffering  more  autonomy,  even  when  faced  with  electricity  cuts.  Vale  has  also  financed  the \nconstruction of two dams on the Muaradzi River, which courses through the Cateme area. With \nthese dams, local producers reinforce their involvement in agricultural activities. In order to turn \nthe  water  transportation  easier,  Vale  has  distributed  287  water  rollers  for  the  Cateme \ncommunity.  \n\nWith  regards  to  the  improvements  in  local  infrastructures,  roads,  drainage,  transportation  and \nother social services were restructures and maintained. Besides the construction of a 8 km road \nand two bridges, Vale has financed bus transportation for the community, a new primary school, \na boarding secondary school, a health center, an ambulance, and a place for the Market. A new \npublic  pharmacy  and  a  Casa  Mãe  Espera  (care  for  pregnant  women)  were  built  in  order  to \nreinforce  maternal  and  child  health.  Vale  has  also  invested  in  access  to  electricity,  reinforcing \nthe  transmission  lines  between  Tete,  Moatize  and  Cateme  and  has  increased  the  distribution \nnet in all streets of the Cateme community, including residencies and public electricity.

In this sense we would like to invite to read the report’s conclusions in the page \n55 of the report: \n (http://www.somo.nl/publications-en/Publication_4188/at_download/fullfile).  \n\nThese conclusions clearly reflect the efforts developed by Inditex regarding not only \nthe  improvement  of  the  working  conditions  in  our  supply  chain,  but  also  a  more \ngeneral  intervention  in  structural  problems  of  the  Brazilian  textile  sector  and,  in  a \nbroader sense, the social and labour integration of migrants in Brazilian society. All \nthese  initiatives  have  been  carried  out  in  close  collaboration  both  with  Brazilian \nNGOs and the Brazilian authorities and they shape the most innovative approach to \nthis issue in the Brazilian industry. \n\nDespite this global positive assessment, SOMO/Repórter Brasil focuses on two main \nconcerns:  a)  the  level  of effectiveness  of  the  compliance  programme  of  Inditex  in \nBrazil  and  b)  the  –according  to  the  editors  of  the  report-  apparent  contradiction \nbetween the CSR policy and the legal approach of the company. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fa)    In the specific field of compliance monitoring in the supply chain, although the \nreport  states  that  “provides  indications  that  the  company’s  supply  chain \nmonitoring  is  not  100%  effective”,  Inditex  can  guarantee  that,  after  the  case \ninvolving  the  Brazilian  company  Ahá  in  summer  2011,  there  has  been  not  a \nsingle  case  of  attempts  against  fundamental  labor  rights  among  the  Brazilian \ncompanies that manufacture its products.   \n\nThe  complete  list  of  Brazilean  companies  supervised  by  Inditex  since  2012 \naccount  for  450  companies,  with  more  than  2,800  audits  completed.  These \nprocedures involve inspections from both independent and international agencies \nas Intertek, SGS and Apcer, and internal surprise visits from in-house teams. Any \ninfringement detected is immediately solved, as the own audits show. \n\nThe  reports  that  you  mention  refer  to  supposed  labour  infringements  in  the \nBrazilean supply chain of Inditex in the past, during 2012, 2013 and 2014. As the \nreport  itself  recognize  (page  49),  most  of  the  initially  mentioned  cases  simply \nwere not related with companies working with Inditex (actually, 65% of the cases \nwere discarded by this reason). Secondly, almost all the cases really related with \nInditex  (85%)  refer  to  usual  discrepancies  between  employees  and  employers \nsolved through conciliation agreements driven under the Inditex’ effort of supply \nchain  monitoring.  The  remaining  cases  (10  during  more  than  two  years  and  a \nhalf) were sanctioned by Labour Courts in regular labour procedures. \n\nNone of the cases mentioned in the report relates to the violation of human rights \nor the systematic breach of basic labour rights, but rather discrepancies between \nemployees  and  employers  in  terms  of  their  respective  assessments  of  specific \naspects of their employment contracts. As is usual in a democratic country with a \nsystem of laws, procedures, and courts, workers are entitled to avail of their right \nto seek protection in a labour court to resolve those discrepancies. The exercise \nof  these  rights  cannot  and  should  not  be  interpreted  as  a  symptom  of  rights \nviolation  but  rather  as  a  sign  that  the  legal  protection  system  afforded  by  a \n\n \n \n \n \n\fdemocratic nation is working as intended. On the contrary, it represents the due \nexercise of his or her rights. \n\nIt  is  true  that  labour  litigation  is  far  more  prevalent  in  Brazil  than  in  other \ndeveloped  economies.  But  compared  to  average  incidence  rates  in  the  overall \nBrazilian  labour  market,  the  number  of  cases  brought  before  the  labour  courts \ninvolving  Inditex’s  supply  chain  point  to  significantly  lower  conflict  rates  - \nspecifically  an  approximate  annual  ratio  of  one  case  for  every  400  workers \ninvolved in Inditex’s supply chain, compared to an average in Brazil of one case \nfor every 25 workers. \n\nThe  report  also  refers  to  the  contents  of  a  hearing  at  the  Labour  Prosecutor’s \nOffice  in  July  2013  to  conclude  that  Inditex  itself  would  recognize  difficulties  to \neffectively  monitor  the  supply  chain.  This  is  just  a  translation  mistake  from  the \nPortuguese original document (attached), where the MPT prosecutors transcript \nInditex  statement  as  follows:  “Inditex  Group  considers  highly  unlikely  [that  a \nsupplier could divert orders to unauthorised workshops], since it would mean the \ncontract  termination  and  that  the  supplier  would  never  work  again  with  the \ngroup”.  Inditex  guarantees  the  correct  performance  and  control  of  the  Brazilian \nsupply chain, backed by the experience of the Framework Agreement signed with \nthe  Federation  of  Unions  and  the  know-how  of  the  audits  performed  by \nindependent companies. \n\nb)    The second concern of the report stands on legal strategy followed by Inditex. \nAs  you  know,  Inditex  has  challenged  the  administrative  procedure  of  the  so \ncalled “Dirty List”, alleging that there is not room for the constitutional right of self-\ndefense. The List is a public exposure of the Companies that have been accused \nof not respecting dignity and labour workers’ right in the supply chain. \n\nFrom  our  point  of  view,  SOMO/Repórter  Brasil  position  contradictorily  argues \nagainst  the  exercise  of  the  constitutional  right  of  any  natural  or  legal  person  to \nappeal a decision before the court authorities but denies it for Inditex.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fWe would like to remark that Inditex’s stance on the “dirty list” is clear-cut: Inditex \nconsiders the list itself totally constitutional. However, Inditex will always defend \nits  democratic  right  to  legitimately  uphold  its  rights  as  an  individual  or  as  a \ncompany,  and  we  have  not  been  given  the  right  to  a  legitimate  defence  in  this \nprocess. The possibility that Zara Brazil could be included on this list would be \nthat  has \nhighly  contradictory  as \ndemonstrated,   an  unprecedented  commitment  to  the  same  objectives  which \nthe “dirty list” sets out to achieve. Inditex would like to be heard, which the current \nprocedure does not allow. \n\nthreatens  punishing  a  company \n\nit \n\nInditex  has  not  only  been  able  to  guarantee  that  there  is  no  precarious \nemployment  among  its  Brazilian  suppliers  since  2011;  the  brand  has  also \ndeveloped  a  more  ambitious  and  innovative  plan  in  Brazil  over  the  last  three \nyears,  with  a  view  to  training  Brazilian  business  owners,  combating  informal \nlabour  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  supporting  the  integration  of  immigrant \ncommunities. Inditex has collaborated closely with renowned NGOs on this task, \nincluding CDHIC, CAMI and Missão Paz. The brand has also worked with public \nbodies  such  as  the  São  Paulo  State  Secretary  of  Justice  and  Defence  of \nCitizenship.  In  the  latter  case,  Inditex  has  contributed  the  funding  required  to \ncreate São Paulo’s Centre for the Integration of Immigrant Citizens. \n\nInditex is implementing one of the most innovative projects in its sector in Brazil \nin order to ensure the traceability of products. Zara is the only retail enterprise in \nBrazil that includes, in all the products manufactured within the country, a label \nspecifying  the  manufacturing  company  and  exact  location  where  the  garments \nwere made, as well as the date when the supplier last underwent an audit. The \nproject, which is called “Fabricado no Brasil” (“Made in Brazil”) is pioneering on a \nglobal level. \n\nfinal  comments  on \n\nthe  report,  we  would \n\nAs \nlist \nof   recommendations  for  clothing  brands  and  retailers  made  by  SOMO/Repórter \nBrasil  (chapter  7.5,  pages  62  and  63)  could  be  perfectly  consider  as  a  reflect  of \nInditex performance in Brazil: \n\nto  remark \n\nthat \n\nlike \n\nthe \n\n  \n \n \n\f-        Consistency  between  legal  and  CSR  strategy:  Inditex  legal  actions  are \nclearly focused on eliminate any sign of arbitrariness and avoid contradictions \nbetween social goals and administrative and legal procedures. Let us to also \nclarify  that  the  “dirty  list”  is  now  suspended  by  a  decision  of  the  Brazilian \nSupreme Court after the request of entities totally alien to Inditex. \n\n-        Supply  chain  mapping  /  Transparency:  Inditex  is  leading  both  the  product \ntraceability  and  the  transparency  of  its  supply  chain,  as  perfectly  shows  not \nonly the development of the accord with the Brazilean labour authorities but \nalso the pioneering project ‘Fabricado no Brasil’. \n\n-        Genuine  and  credible  grievance  mechanism:  The  report  itself,  although  it \ndoes  not  refer  to  the  grievance  mechanism  include  in  the  Inditex  Code  of \nConduct  for  Manufacturers  and  Suppliers,  expressly  mention  (page  43)  the \ndevelopment  of  the  ‘ad  hoc’  mechanism  established  by  Inditex  with  the \nBrazilean NGO CDHIC. \n\n2.- Comments on the articles: \n-  “Fashion  brand  Zara once  again  associated  with  Brazilian  labour  rights  abuses”,  SOMO \nand  Repórter  Brasil,   9  May  2015,  http://www.somo.nl/news-en/fashion-brand-zara-\nassociated-once-again-in-brazilian-labour-rights-abuses \n- [Português] “Zara corta oficinas de imigrantes e será multada por discriminação”, Repórter \nBrasil,  9  May  2015,  http://reporterbrasil.org.br/2015/05/zara-corta-oficinas-de-imigrantes-e-\nsera-multada-por-discriminacao/ \n\nAllegations  contained  in  these  articles  release  in  coordination  by  SOMO  and \nRepórter  Brasil  were  directly  responded  by  Inditex  to  the  authors,  as  could  easily \nchecked  visiting  http://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Respostas-\nZara.pdf. A summary of the Inditex´arguments is as follows: \n\nLabour infractions in the supply chain \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWith  regard  to  the  recent  Brazilian  Labour  Inspection´s  report  claiming  about \nsupossed labour infractions among companies supplying Inditex in Brazil, we must \nfirmly state that: \n\ni)  All  the  cases,  which  are  minor  infringements  that  could  be  easily  solved \nwhen  reported,  are  referred  to  previous  years,  mostly  2012  and  2013,  and \ncannot be defined as 'new'. \nii)  In  any  case,  it  is  not  understandable  why  they  have  not  been  reported \npreviously during all these years. \niii) Following the Law and the Inditex’s Agreement, the Labour inspection had \nthe obligation of reporting any finding to Inditex, which would have then days \nto solve the case. \niv)  Inditex’s  production  represents  only  the  15%  of  the  whole  manufacturing \ncapacity  of  the  Brazilian  companies  mentioned  in  the  Labour  Inspection \nreport, the rest being dedicated to other Brazilian brands. \nv)  The  filing  presents  many  other  inaccuracies  and  unfairly  targets  Inditex \n(please see below analysis about the ‘findings’). \nvi) For all these reasons it has been challenged by Inditex. \n\nWe truly believe that one claim like that cannot be sustained. \n\nAs a matter of fact, as we have previously mentioned, since 2012 Inditex has carried \nout more than 2,800 audits to the Brazilian companies that manufacture its products, \nsupported by the most demanding international procedures based on our Framework \nAgreement with the Global Federation of Unions (IndustriALL, which represents 50 \nmillion  workers  in  144  Countries)  and  performed  by  prestigious  international  and \nindependent agencies as Intertek, SGS and Apcer. Inditex can firmly guarantee the \ncorrect performance of this Brazilian supply chain in terms of labour standards. \n\nAs it has been mentioned beforehand, Inditex’s production represents only the 15% \nof the whole manufacturing capacity of this supply chain, the rest being dedicated to \nother Brazilian brands. It is surprising both that no other brand has been appointed in \nthis  sense  and  the  fact  that  in  all  this  period  since  2012  there  has  not  been  any \n\n \n \n \n \n\freport  from  the  authorities.  Should  they  be  right  now  –even  all  being  minor \nadministrative  cases-,  it  is  not  understandable  why  did  they  not  communicate  any \nissue on time. Mainly because Inditex’s 2011 Agreement with the Labour Inspection \nin Brazil obliges them to do so: to communicate it, should they find any issue, and \nafterwards Inditex had 10 days to solve the case. \n\nIn  the  meantime,  every  Inditex  audit  had  previously  detected  and,  what  is  more \nimportant, solved these cases through the Inditex Compliance Programme. \n\nAnalysis about the ‘findings’: \n\n- All of these cases are administrative infringements. There is not a single case of \nviolation of fundamental rights. \n-  All  of  the  cases  presented  concern  administrative  matters  that  can  be  easily \ncorrected when the irregularity is discovered. \n- During the whole period covered (from 2012 to 2015), audits performed by Inditex \nhave been implemented with its own correction plans, solving in many cases similar \nproblems to the ones included in the Labour Inspection file. \n\na)    Employees working without a formal contract in eight different companies \n\n·          After  checking  the  information  sent  by  the  MTE,  we  can  only  see  17 \nworkers  not  registered.  The  information  sent  by  the  SRTE/SP  does  not \nclarify as the list of all the companies with not registered workers does not \nfit  with  actual  non-compliance  of  in  the  single  files  of  each  of  these \ncompanies. \n\n·          Apparently,  some  or  many  of  these  workers  could  be  in  the  five \n\ncompanies that were not part of the supply chain \n\n·          Also,  our  the  audits  show  that  it  is  not  eight  but  six  companies  who \nwere actually part of the supply chain. Two of them, even being listed in \nthe  TAC  suppliers’  list,  they  were  blocked  for  different  reasons  prior  to \nmanufacture any garment. \n\n·         All these six companies were audited between July 2012 and July 2014 \n\n \n \n \n \n\f·         The audits show that there was also one not registered worker issue in \n\n2013 that was of course solved. \n\n·         None of these eight Companies work anymore in the scope of Inditex. \n\nThey have left to be suppliers between December 12 and July 14. \n\nb)    Companies with excess of working hours \n\n·         We could only confirm 16 of the Companies with these issues from the \n\ninformation sent by the MTE. \n\n·         One of them is blocked and never manufactured in the supply chain. \n·         Of the other 15, one does not work anymore in the supply chain. \n·         The audits for the other 14, suggested to two of them correction plans \nto eliminate any excess of working hours, which has been implemented. \n\n·         No other issues remain in this sense \n\nc)     Companies with FGTS debits \n\n·         In this case we could confirm all the 23 companies listed by the Labour \n\nAuthority. \n\n·         Six of them were blocked and never manufactured in the supply chain. \n·         The other 17 have been audited between July 2012 and April 2015. \n·         These audits also have found and corrected five FGTS debts. \n·          Six  of  these  companies  with  no  major  current  issues  remain  in  the \n\nsupply chain. \n\nd)    Companies with Health and Safety deficiencies \n\n·          We  can  confirm  that  the  audits  of  all  these  companies  have  been \nperformed  correctly  and  on  time  and  that  the  audits  show  a  permanent \ntask for improving health and safety standards. \n\nZara  currently  only  works  with  34  of  the  62  Brazilian  companies  the  SRTE/SP's \norders concern. Zara can confirm that there are no relevant irregularities, as shown \nby  the  audit  reports  produced  by  international  firms  that  specialise  in  such \ninspections: SGS, Intertek and Apcer. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fBaseless discrimination charge \n\nZara does not have any capacity to intervene in the recruitment of employees by the \ncompanies  with  which  it  maintains  commercial  relationships,  for  whom  Zara  is  just \none more client among many other, given that \nproduction  by  Zara  in  these  factories  implies  less  than  15%  of  the  total,  as  it  has \npreviosly  been  mentioned.  To  accept  this  premise  would  be  to  accept  that  all \nthis  alleged \nBrazilian  business  people \ndiscriminatory practices. \n\nthese  suppliers  apply \n\nthat  contract \n\nTo base this surprising, and completely untrue, accusation on the fact that inspectors \nhave  not  been  able  to  find  workers  of  Bolivian  origin  in  some  of  Zara's  suppliers \nleads to the somewhat absurd conclusion that this same discrimination is produced \nin any of the Brazilian companies that do not have Bolivian employees -or from any \nother nationality, origin or race. \n\nAlso, this allegation of discrimination is not supported by facts. Zara is a multinational \ncompany and naturally employs people from different origins and nationalities.  \n\nIt  is  important  to  remember  that  Zara  has  been  fighting  against  precarious \nemployment for years, with various initiatives and specific investment in Brazil. Since \n2011 the company has invested R$14 million in various programs, fundamentally for \nimmigrant support. \n\nThis social investment is focused on two aspects: \n-  Training  and  support  for  micro-companies  and  immigrant  employees  to  assist \nelimination of irregular practices in the textile sector of this country. \n-  Emergency  assistance  and  support  for  social  and  labour  integration  of  the \nimmigrants. \n\nThis task is carried out in collaboration with notable NGO's (such as CDHIC, CAMI or \nMissão  Paz)  and  also  includes  actions  such  as  the  funding  necessary  for  the \ncreation  of  the  Centre  for  Integration  of  Immigrants  to  Citizenship,  in  collaboration \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fwith the Secretary of Citizenship and Justice of the State of São Paulo. The Centre \nintends \nimmigrants  per  day,  assisting  with  migratory \nto  1000 \nstandardisation and promoting professional education. \n\nto  attend \n\nlíder  contra \n\n[Español]  “El \n\n3.- Comments on the following article: \n- \nmultinacionales”, El Diario, 28 April 2015, \n http://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/sociedad/esclavitud-infantil-trabajo-Asia-\nninos_0_382161784.html \n\nla  esclavitud \n\nincomoda  a \n\ninfantil  que \n\nlas  grandes \n\nThe statements made to a Spanish newspaper by Mr. Ehsan Ullah Khan are untrue, \nlack any foundation and they can only be the result of an unjustified obsession with \nslander purpose.

The  inclusion  of  our  name  among  these \nfactories’ buyers in some of the documents attached to the HRW report (which does not mention Inditex) \nonly could be the result of a misunderstanding. With regard to Zhong Yin (Cambodia) B Textile Co. Ltd, it \nwas an indirect supplier that provided months ago an order of 1,520 units. No more orders have been or \nwill be placed with this factory due to production concerns. \n\nDespite our limited ability to intervene (our purchases in this market are less than 2% of overall Inditex \npurchases), Inditex has always been very proactive in demanding the correct levels of Labour Rights and \ndecent wages to the Cambodian textile sector. \n\nIn this sense, we have offered our full assistance in this task to both the Cambodian union C.CAWDU and \nthe  international  trade  unions  federation  IndustriALL,  as  is  customary  practice  under  the  scope  of  the \nprocedures regulated by the Global Framework Agreement between IndustriALL and Inditex. \n\nWe  must  underline  the  importance  of  this  framework  agreement  as  it  has  shown  its  relevance  and \nefficiency  in  preventing  and  solving  issues  in  the  factories  and  in  the  supply  chain.  Based  in  the \nunderstanding  that  only  through  the  joint  efforts  of  all  major  players  in  the  textile  sector  the  never \nending  task  of  improving  conditions  can  be  achieved,  Inditex  and  IndustriALL  have  worked  together  in \nsolving  situations  in  India,  Bangladesh,  Morocco,  Brazil,  Portugal,  etc.  We  truly  believe  that  this  is  the \nright  path  to  build  a  solid  an  ethical  new  future  for  the  sector.  Mr.  Jyrki  Raina,  secretary  general  of \nIndustriALL,  has  stressed  the  importance  of  how  this  procedure  “has  developed  robust  systems  to \nprevent, control and remedy” potential breaches against workers’ rights. \n\nIt  is  of  importance  also  to  highlight  our  support  of  the  ILO  ‘Better  Factories’  Initiative,  which  has  been \nimplemented  in  Cambodia.  We  believe  that  initiatives  like  this,  in  which  all  major  players  included \nGovernments must be involved, are key to succeed in our purpose. \n\nFinally,  we  would  like  to  mention  the  long-term  commitment  of  Inditex,  alongside  other  international \napparel-makers,  to  establishing  an  adequate  labor  conflict  resolution  system  in  Cambodia.  We  believe \nthat  encouraging  steps  have  been  taken  in  this  direction  of  late  and  that  continued  progress  strongly \ndepends on engaged dialogue and  collaboration among all the  vested parties, namely employers, trade \nunions, buyers and NGOs.  \n\nCommunication and Corporate Affairs Division \nINDITEX"}

In this sense we would like to invite to read the report’s conclusions in the page \n55 of the report: \n (http://www.somo.nl/publications-en/Publication_4188/at_download/fullfile).  \n\nThese conclusions clearly reflect the efforts developed by Inditex regarding not only \nthe  improvement  of  the  working  conditions  in  our  supply  chain,  but  also  a  more \ngeneral  intervention  in  structural  problems  of  the  Brazilian  textile  sector  and,  in  a \nbroader sense, the social and labour integration of migrants in Brazilian society. All \nthese  initiatives  have  been  carried  out  in  close  collaboration  both  with  Brazilian \nNGOs and the Brazilian authorities and they shape the most innovative approach to \nthis issue in the Brazilian industry. \n\nDespite this global positive assessment, SOMO/Repórter Brasil focuses on two main \nconcerns:  a)  the  level  of effectiveness  of  the  compliance  programme  of  Inditex  in \nBrazil  and  b)  the  –according  to  the  editors  of  the  report-  apparent  contradiction \nbetween the CSR policy and the legal approach of the company. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fa)    In the specific field of compliance monitoring in the supply chain, although the \nreport  states  that  “provides  indications  that  the  company’s  supply  chain \nmonitoring  is  not  100%  effective”,  Inditex  can  guarantee  that,  after  the  case \ninvolving  the  Brazilian  company  Ahá  in  summer  2011,  there  has  been  not  a \nsingle  case  of  attempts  against  fundamental  labor  rights  among  the  Brazilian \ncompanies that manufacture its products.   \n\nThe  complete  list  of  Brazilean  companies  supervised  by  Inditex  since  2012 \naccount  for  450  companies,  with  more  than  2,800  audits  completed.  These \nprocedures involve inspections from both independent and international agencies \nas Intertek, SGS and Apcer, and internal surprise visits from in-house teams. Any \ninfringement detected is immediately solved, as the own audits show. \n\nThe  reports  that  you  mention  refer  to  supposed  labour  infringements  in  the \nBrazilean supply chain of Inditex in the past, during 2012, 2013 and 2014. As the \nreport  itself  recognize  (page  49),  most  of  the  initially  mentioned  cases  simply \nwere not related with companies working with Inditex (actually, 65% of the cases \nwere discarded by this reason). Secondly, almost all the cases really related with \nInditex  (85%)  refer  to  usual  discrepancies  between  employees  and  employers \nsolved through conciliation agreements driven under the Inditex’ effort of supply \nchain  monitoring.  The  remaining  cases  (10  during  more  than  two  years  and  a \nhalf) were sanctioned by Labour Courts in regular labour procedures. \n\nNone of the cases mentioned in the report relates to the violation of human rights \nor the systematic breach of basic labour rights, but rather discrepancies between \nemployees  and  employers  in  terms  of  their  respective  assessments  of  specific \naspects of their employment contracts. As is usual in a democratic country with a \nsystem of laws, procedures, and courts, workers are entitled to avail of their right \nto seek protection in a labour court to resolve those discrepancies. The exercise \nof  these  rights  cannot  and  should  not  be  interpreted  as  a  symptom  of  rights \nviolation  but  rather  as  a  sign  that  the  legal  protection  system  afforded  by  a \n\n \n \n \n \n\fdemocratic nation is working as intended. On the contrary, it represents the due \nexercise of his or her rights. \n\nIt  is  true  that  labour  litigation  is  far  more  prevalent  in  Brazil  than  in  other \ndeveloped  economies.  But  compared  to  average  incidence  rates  in  the  overall \nBrazilian  labour  market,  the  number  of  cases  brought  before  the  labour  courts \ninvolving  Inditex’s  supply  chain  point  to  significantly  lower  conflict  rates  - \nspecifically  an  approximate  annual  ratio  of  one  case  for  every  400  workers \ninvolved in Inditex’s supply chain, compared to an average in Brazil of one case \nfor every 25 workers. \n\nThe  report  also  refers  to  the  contents  of  a  hearing  at  the  Labour  Prosecutor’s \nOffice  in  July  2013  to  conclude  that  Inditex  itself  would  recognize  difficulties  to \neffectively  monitor  the  supply  chain.  This  is  just  a  translation  mistake  from  the \nPortuguese original document (attached), where the MPT prosecutors transcript \nInditex  statement  as  follows:  “Inditex  Group  considers  highly  unlikely  [that  a \nsupplier could divert orders to unauthorised workshops], since it would mean the \ncontract  termination  and  that  the  supplier  would  never  work  again  with  the \ngroup”.  Inditex  guarantees  the  correct  performance  and  control  of  the  Brazilian \nsupply chain, backed by the experience of the Framework Agreement signed with \nthe  Federation  of  Unions  and  the  know-how  of  the  audits  performed  by \nindependent companies. \n\nb)    The second concern of the report stands on legal strategy followed by Inditex. \nAs  you  know,  Inditex  has  challenged  the  administrative  procedure  of  the  so \ncalled “Dirty List”, alleging that there is not room for the constitutional right of self-\ndefense. The List is a public exposure of the Companies that have been accused \nof not respecting dignity and labour workers’ right in the supply chain. \n\nFrom  our  point  of  view,  SOMO/Repórter  Brasil  position  contradictorily  argues \nagainst  the  exercise  of  the  constitutional  right  of  any  natural  or  legal  person  to \nappeal a decision before the court authorities but denies it for Inditex.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fWe would like to remark that Inditex’s stance on the “dirty list” is clear-cut: Inditex \nconsiders the list itself totally constitutional. However, Inditex will always defend \nits  democratic  right  to  legitimately  uphold  its  rights  as  an  individual  or  as  a \ncompany,  and  we  have  not  been  given  the  right  to  a  legitimate  defence  in  this \nprocess. The possibility that Zara Brazil could be included on this list would be \nthat  has \nhighly  contradictory  as \ndemonstrated,   an  unprecedented  commitment  to  the  same  objectives  which \nthe “dirty list” sets out to achieve. Inditex would like to be heard, which the current \nprocedure does not allow. \n\nthreatens  punishing  a  company \n\nit \n\nInditex  has  not  only  been  able  to  guarantee  that  there  is  no  precarious \nemployment  among  its  Brazilian  suppliers  since  2011;  the  brand  has  also \ndeveloped  a  more  ambitious  and  innovative  plan  in  Brazil  over  the  last  three \nyears,  with  a  view  to  training  Brazilian  business  owners,  combating  informal \nlabour  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  supporting  the  integration  of  immigrant \ncommunities. Inditex has collaborated closely with renowned NGOs on this task, \nincluding CDHIC, CAMI and Missão Paz. The brand has also worked with public \nbodies  such  as  the  São  Paulo  State  Secretary  of  Justice  and  Defence  of \nCitizenship.  In  the  latter  case,  Inditex  has  contributed  the  funding  required  to \ncreate São Paulo’s Centre for the Integration of Immigrant Citizens. \n\nInditex is implementing one of the most innovative projects in its sector in Brazil \nin order to ensure the traceability of products. Zara is the only retail enterprise in \nBrazil that includes, in all the products manufactured within the country, a label \nspecifying  the  manufacturing  company  and  exact  location  where  the  garments \nwere made, as well as the date when the supplier last underwent an audit. The \nproject, which is called “Fabricado no Brasil” (“Made in Brazil”) is pioneering on a \nglobal level. \n\nfinal  comments  on \n\nthe  report,  we  would \n\nAs \nlist \nof   recommendations  for  clothing  brands  and  retailers  made  by  SOMO/Repórter \nBrasil  (chapter  7.5,  pages  62  and  63)  could  be  perfectly  consider  as  a  reflect  of \nInditex performance in Brazil: \n\nto  remark \n\nthat \n\nlike \n\nthe \n\n  \n \n \n\f-        Consistency  between  legal  and  CSR  strategy:  Inditex  legal  actions  are \nclearly focused on eliminate any sign of arbitrariness and avoid contradictions \nbetween social goals and administrative and legal procedures. Let us to also \nclarify  that  the  “dirty  list”  is  now  suspended  by  a  decision  of  the  Brazilian \nSupreme Court after the request of entities totally alien to Inditex. \n\n-        Supply  chain  mapping  /  Transparency:  Inditex  is  leading  both  the  product \ntraceability  and  the  transparency  of  its  supply  chain,  as  perfectly  shows  not \nonly the development of the accord with the Brazilean labour authorities but \nalso the pioneering project ‘Fabricado no Brasil’. \n\n-        Genuine  and  credible  grievance  mechanism:  The  report  itself,  although  it \ndoes  not  refer  to  the  grievance  mechanism  include  in  the  Inditex  Code  of \nConduct  for  Manufacturers  and  Suppliers,  expressly  mention  (page  43)  the \ndevelopment  of  the  ‘ad  hoc’  mechanism  established  by  Inditex  with  the \nBrazilean NGO CDHIC. \n\n2.- Comments on the articles: \n-  “Fashion  brand  Zara once  again  associated  with  Brazilian  labour  rights  abuses”,  SOMO \nand  Repórter  Brasil,   9  May  2015,  http://www.somo.nl/news-en/fashion-brand-zara-\nassociated-once-again-in-brazilian-labour-rights-abuses \n- [Português] “Zara corta oficinas de imigrantes e será multada por discriminação”, Repórter \nBrasil,  9  May  2015,  http://reporterbrasil.org.br/2015/05/zara-corta-oficinas-de-imigrantes-e-\nsera-multada-por-discriminacao/ \n\nAllegations  contained  in  these  articles  release  in  coordination  by  SOMO  and \nRepórter  Brasil  were  directly  responded  by  Inditex  to  the  authors,  as  could  easily \nchecked  visiting  http://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Respostas-\nZara.pdf. A summary of the Inditex´arguments is as follows: \n\nLabour infractions in the supply chain \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWith  regard  to  the  recent  Brazilian  Labour  Inspection´s  report  claiming  about \nsupossed labour infractions among companies supplying Inditex in Brazil, we must \nfirmly state that: \n\ni)  All  the  cases,  which  are  minor  infringements  that  could  be  easily  solved \nwhen  reported,  are  referred  to  previous  years,  mostly  2012  and  2013,  and \ncannot be defined as 'new'. \nii)  In  any  case,  it  is  not  understandable  why  they  have  not  been  reported \npreviously during all these years. \niii) Following the Law and the Inditex’s Agreement, the Labour inspection had \nthe obligation of reporting any finding to Inditex, which would have then days \nto solve the case. \niv)  Inditex’s  production  represents  only  the  15%  of  the  whole  manufacturing \ncapacity  of  the  Brazilian  companies  mentioned  in  the  Labour  Inspection \nreport, the rest being dedicated to other Brazilian brands. \nv)  The  filing  presents  many  other  inaccuracies  and  unfairly  targets  Inditex \n(please see below analysis about the ‘findings’). \nvi) For all these reasons it has been challenged by Inditex. \n\nWe truly believe that one claim like that cannot be sustained. \n\nAs a matter of fact, as we have previously mentioned, since 2012 Inditex has carried \nout more than 2,800 audits to the Brazilian companies that manufacture its products, \nsupported by the most demanding international procedures based on our Framework \nAgreement with the Global Federation of Unions (IndustriALL, which represents 50 \nmillion  workers  in  144  Countries)  and  performed  by  prestigious  international  and \nindependent agencies as Intertek, SGS and Apcer. Inditex can firmly guarantee the \ncorrect performance of this Brazilian supply chain in terms of labour standards. \n\nAs it has been mentioned beforehand, Inditex’s production represents only the 15% \nof the whole manufacturing capacity of this supply chain, the rest being dedicated to \nother Brazilian brands. It is surprising both that no other brand has been appointed in \nthis  sense  and  the  fact  that  in  all  this  period  since  2012  there  has  not  been  any \n\n \n \n \n \n\freport  from  the  authorities.  Should  they  be  right  now  –even  all  being  minor \nadministrative  cases-,  it  is  not  understandable  why  did  they  not  communicate  any \nissue on time. Mainly because Inditex’s 2011 Agreement with the Labour Inspection \nin Brazil obliges them to do so: to communicate it, should they find any issue, and \nafterwards Inditex had 10 days to solve the case. \n\nIn  the  meantime,  every  Inditex  audit  had  previously  detected  and,  what  is  more \nimportant, solved these cases through the Inditex Compliance Programme. \n\nAnalysis about the ‘findings’: \n\n- All of these cases are administrative infringements. There is not a single case of \nviolation of fundamental rights. \n-  All  of  the  cases  presented  concern  administrative  matters  that  can  be  easily \ncorrected when the irregularity is discovered. \n- During the whole period covered (from 2012 to 2015), audits performed by Inditex \nhave been implemented with its own correction plans, solving in many cases similar \nproblems to the ones included in the Labour Inspection file. \n\na)    Employees working without a formal contract in eight different companies \n\n·          After  checking  the  information  sent  by  the  MTE,  we  can  only  see  17 \nworkers  not  registered.  The  information  sent  by  the  SRTE/SP  does  not \nclarify as the list of all the companies with not registered workers does not \nfit  with  actual  non-compliance  of  in  the  single  files  of  each  of  these \ncompanies. \n\n·          Apparently,  some  or  many  of  these  workers  could  be  in  the  five \n\ncompanies that were not part of the supply chain \n\n·          Also,  our  the  audits  show  that  it  is  not  eight  but  six  companies  who \nwere actually part of the supply chain. Two of them, even being listed in \nthe  TAC  suppliers’  list,  they  were  blocked  for  different  reasons  prior  to \nmanufacture any garment. \n\n·         All these six companies were audited between July 2012 and July 2014 \n\n \n \n \n \n\f·         The audits show that there was also one not registered worker issue in \n\n2013 that was of course solved. \n\n·         None of these eight Companies work anymore in the scope of Inditex. \n\nThey have left to be suppliers between December 12 and July 14. \n\nb)    Companies with excess of working hours \n\n·         We could only confirm 16 of the Companies with these issues from the \n\ninformation sent by the MTE. \n\n·         One of them is blocked and never manufactured in the supply chain. \n·         Of the other 15, one does not work anymore in the supply chain. \n·         The audits for the other 14, suggested to two of them correction plans \nto eliminate any excess of working hours, which has been implemented. \n\n·         No other issues remain in this sense \n\nc)     Companies with FGTS debits \n\n·         In this case we could confirm all the 23 companies listed by the Labour \n\nAuthority. \n\n·         Six of them were blocked and never manufactured in the supply chain. \n·         The other 17 have been audited between July 2012 and April 2015. \n·         These audits also have found and corrected five FGTS debts. \n·          Six  of  these  companies  with  no  major  current  issues  remain  in  the \n\nsupply chain. \n\nd)    Companies with Health and Safety deficiencies \n\n·          We  can  confirm  that  the  audits  of  all  these  companies  have  been \nperformed  correctly  and  on  time  and  that  the  audits  show  a  permanent \ntask for improving health and safety standards. \n\nZara  currently  only  works  with  34  of  the  62  Brazilian  companies  the  SRTE/SP's \norders concern. Zara can confirm that there are no relevant irregularities, as shown \nby  the  audit  reports  produced  by  international  firms  that  specialise  in  such \ninspections: SGS, Intertek and Apcer. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fBaseless discrimination charge \n\nZara does not have any capacity to intervene in the recruitment of employees by the \ncompanies  with  which  it  maintains  commercial  relationships,  for  whom  Zara  is  just \none more client among many other, given that \nproduction  by  Zara  in  these  factories  implies  less  than  15%  of  the  total,  as  it  has \npreviosly  been  mentioned.  To  accept  this  premise  would  be  to  accept  that  all \nthis  alleged \nBrazilian  business  people \ndiscriminatory practices. \n\nthese  suppliers  apply \n\nthat  contract \n\nTo base this surprising, and completely untrue, accusation on the fact that inspectors \nhave  not  been  able  to  find  workers  of  Bolivian  origin  in  some  of  Zara's  suppliers \nleads to the somewhat absurd conclusion that this same discrimination is produced \nin any of the Brazilian companies that do not have Bolivian employees -or from any \nother nationality, origin or race. \n\nAlso, this allegation of discrimination is not supported by facts. Zara is a multinational \ncompany and naturally employs people from different origins and nationalities.  \n\nIt  is  important  to  remember  that  Zara  has  been  fighting  against  precarious \nemployment for years, with various initiatives and specific investment in Brazil. Since \n2011 the company has invested R$14 million in various programs, fundamentally for \nimmigrant support. \n\nThis social investment is focused on two aspects: \n-  Training  and  support  for  micro-companies  and  immigrant  employees  to  assist \nelimination of irregular practices in the textile sector of this country. \n-  Emergency  assistance  and  support  for  social  and  labour  integration  of  the \nimmigrants. \n\nThis task is carried out in collaboration with notable NGO's (such as CDHIC, CAMI or \nMissão  Paz)  and  also  includes  actions  such  as  the  funding  necessary  for  the \ncreation  of  the  Centre  for  Integration  of  Immigrants  to  Citizenship,  in  collaboration \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fwith the Secretary of Citizenship and Justice of the State of São Paulo.

On 10 November, our\nemployees at Antamina mine in Peru began industrial action motivated by the profit sharing\nthat employees receive. IndustriALL alleged that the strike was in response to health and\nsafety violations, Antamina routinely violating the collective bargaining agreement and\nemployees being denied fair payment for bonuses and overtime and being excluded from the\nMiners’ Pension Fund.\n\nThe profit-sharing payment was lower in 2014 due to lower production at Antamina as a result\nof planned lower head grades; this was in full compliance with the law. Both the regional and\nnational governments in Peru ruled the strike illegal.\n\nThroughout the strike, Antamina continued to operate, supported by non-striking employees.\nThe strike ended on 8 December and all workers returned to work.\n\nWe take a proactive approach towards industrial relations, actively engaging with our\nemployees and the unions representing them. We report on the number of employees\nrepresented by an independent trade union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement\neach year in our sustainability report (71% in 2014). We also report in our sustainability report\non the number, duration and status of industrial action that takes place at our operations. The\nmajority of our assets have good working relationships with the unions representing our\nemployees. We are committed to working honestly and openly with labour unions at all of our\noperations and undertake negotiations in good faith.\n\nWe recognise that our people are fundamental to our success. We treat all of our employees\nand contractors fairly and with respect.\n\nWe uphold the rights of all our workers to freedom of association, right to unionise and\ncollective representation, regardless of their location or purpose. We are active in upholding,\nprotecting and promoting human rights and are committed to the United Nations’ Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. We support the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human\nRights as a framework for the responsibilities of governments and corporations to protect the\nrights of individuals and groups and ensure that redress is available if any of these rights are\ninfringed.\n\nOur Code of Conduct sets out the standards we expect all of our people to meet and\neveryone working for Glencore, regardless of the location or function, is expected to fully\napply it to their workplace and responsibilities.

Together with Gap Inc and N Brown Group plc, we have sent a joint letter, urging the Government to set a negotiated minimum wage level that is uniform across all industries as well as annual reviews of the minimum wage.\nOur role as a brand and buyer is not to set or recommend the level of wages. Our approach is that wages should be negotiated between the parties on the labour market. We require our suppliers to pay their employees the wages and overtime remuneration to which they are legally entitled, and check that they do so.  We are well aware that the opportunities for employees to negotiate are limited in many countries, including Myanmar. That is why we are developing projects and programs which have the aim of strengthening employees’ rights and their ability to negotiate on their own behalf on their terms and conditions through trade unions or other elected employee representatives.\nOn 17 July, H&M published on its website a \"\nStatement on Wages and Industrial Relations in Myanmar\n\"\nWe welcome the efforts of the Myanmar Government to enact the Minimum Wage Law; however, we are concerned that it has not been implemented in the past two years since its enactment. In setting a minimum wage level, we advise that the Government set a uniform level across all industries in compliance with the ILO C.131 Minimum Wage Fixing Convention. If the garment industry wage levels are lower than other industries, it will not be able to attract and retain a skilled labor force, which it needs to develop and grow into a thriving economic driver.\nThe minimum wage should be reconsidered through an annual review mechanism, which is inclusive of key stakeholders, and is aimed at laying the foundation for a vibrant tripartite industrial relations and wage level negotiations process based on transparency, inclusiveness and peaceful negotiation.\nWe attach high importance to freedom of association – according to ILO Convention C087 Freedom of Association and peaceful resolution of conflict.  Ideally this should lead to social dialogue between employers and worker representatives in which issues can be constructively resolved and in which more broadly – according to ILO Convention C. 98 – Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining can ensue.\nOccasionally–whenever issues cannot be resolved–workers may choose to go on strike or protest. We attach great importance to the peaceful resolution of worker protests. When violence is used by public or private sector security forces to curtail workers’ peaceful protests, this is likely to be more of a deterrent to companies considering sourcing from Myanmar than the strikes themselves, and will have a significant negative impact on Myanmar’s reputation.  Similarly, where workers representatives are detained or dismissed for striking, this will also have a negative impact on Myanmar’s reputation and will be a factor which investors consider.\nThis lack of clarity in the regulatory environment can cause business uncertainty and we encourage the Minimum Wage Law’s urgent implementation, uniform across all industries."}

The  entities  that  filed \nthe public civil lawsuit appealed this decision and the appeal should be heard soon by the Superior \nCourt of Justice, which may order the construction work to be halted once more.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nVale clarifies that the environmental licensing of the Carajás Railroad (EFC)’s  expansion was based \non the legal standards of the federal, state and municipal spheres. All the social and environmental \nstudies, plans and programs developed to mitigate the impacts caused by the work were properly \nsubmitted  and  compiled  in  the  Basic  Environmental  Plan  (PBA).  With  regard  to  indigenous  and \nquilombola \nspecific \nrecommendations  have  been  developed  for  each  affected  community.  All  these  steps  had  the \nparticipation  of \nintense  process  engagement  and \nconsultation,  offering  access  to  information  about  the  enterprise  before  the  implementation  had \nbegun,  discussing  their  worries  and  demands  and  working  on  short  and  long  term  mitigation \nprograms  \n\nindigenous  communities,  reflecting  an \n\nimpact  matrices \n\nanthropological \n\ncommunities, \n\ndiagnoses, \n\nand \n\nVale  acted  in  line  with  legal  provisions,  holding  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special \nconcern  for  technical  studies  regarding  indigenous  peoples  and  quilombola  communities,  and \nextensive  dialogue  with  them.  Communication  with  communities  near  the  railroad  is  permanent. \nPublic meetings were held with the affected communities on July 9, 10, 12 and 13, 2012, in addition \nto  meetings  dedicated  exclusively  to  quilombola  and  indigenous  communities.  These  public \nmeetings and hearings complied with the terms of CONAMA Resolution 09/86, which provides for \nprocedures for public participation within the scope of environmental licensing.  \n\nDue  to  the  regularity  of  the  studies  and  the  entire  public  consultation  process,  Vale  obtained  the \nrespective environmental licenses to install the project, and obtained approval from FUNAI and the \nPalmares Foundation to expand the railroad.  \n\nConcerning  the  Free,  Prior,  and  Informed  Consent  procedure  for  indigenous  and  traditional \npopulations, although Brazil abides by ILO Convention 169, through Legislative  Decree 143/2002, \nthe regulations stipulating procedures and the scope of rules is still under discussions.. Regardless \nof  this,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialogue  established  between  Vale  and  the  traditional \ncommunities  along  the  EFC,  as  well  as  the  provision  of  all  necessary  information  related  to  the \nproject  previous  of  its  implementation  to  these  communities,  in-person,  and  the  consultation  on \nwhich  and  how  the  mitigations  plans  should  be  developed  and  implemented  meet  the  essential \nobjective of ILO Convention 169. \n\nThe regularity of the environmental licensing process was reaffirmed in a court ruling of the Federal \nRegional Court (TRF), which recognized that the measures taken by Vale are in full compliance with \nthe requirements of the competent technical and environmental authorities. Note that the work does \nnot  involve  building  a  new  railroad  or  double-tracking  the  entire  length  of  the  existing  one,  but \nmerely  connecting  existing  railroad  yards  along  the  original  track,  which  will  generate  benefits  for \ngeneral  cargo  and  passenger  transportation,  besides  the  iron  ore.  Accordingly,  Vale  has  been \ninvesting  heavily  in  local  manpower  training  and  social  and  environmental  programs  to  boost  the \nlocal development of the region and its population. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

In  search  of  a  better  life  or \nescaping from their families, they try to reach São Luís in a state of extreme vulnerability, danger to \ntheir lives and utter lack of dignity. These children and teenagers hide among the iron ore, with only \ntheir  heads  appearing,  or  using  the  upper  part  of  a  soft  drink  bottle  as  a  funnel  through  which  to \nbreathe. Climbing into the iron ore railcars while the train is moving is extremely dangerous, leading \nin many cases to injury or mutilation. Cases of physical violence and threats against the children by \nVale’s   security   guards   have   also   been   reported.  Operating  for  three  decades  in  the  region,  Vale \ndoes not admit that this is an impact caused by mining and claims it is a consequence of existing \nsocioeconomic  problems.

In  the  case  of  railroad  crossings,  Vale \nconducts  periodic  inspections  to  regularize  or  remove  illegal  crossings.  To  regularize  them,  the \ncompany counts the number of vehicles that use them in order to identify the need for signage and \ncrossing adjustments, or to install a road bridge. \n\nOfficial  railroad  crossings  are  those  that  have  been  approved  and  recognized  by  Vale,  and  they \nreceive proper signage and maintenance. The Carajás Railroad has 126 official railroad crossings \nalong its 892-km length, with an average distance between crossings of around 7 km.  \n\nAccording  to  the  National  Association  of  Railroad  Transportation  Companies  (ANTF),  the  EFC  is \nnow  considered   one   of   Brazil’s   leading   railroads,  not  only  due  to  its  freight  volumes,  but  also \nbecause it uses cutting-edge technology in its operations, making it highly productive, efficient and \nsafe.

This  study  was  carried  out  by  UFES  under  the  technical \ncoordination of IEMA, and was completed in 2011. Material was collected between April 2009 and \nJanuary  2011  at  nine  monitoring  stations  in  Greater  Vitória.  As  a  result,  it  was  seen  that  the \natmospheric  quality  standards  defined  by  the  National  Environment  Council  are  being  complied \nwith, and that the contribution of industries is only predominant at the Senac Hotel station, on Boi \nIsland.  At  the  Enseada  do  Suá  and  Carapina  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  of  the  same \nmagnitude as the contribution  called  “human  activities” (re-suspension of soils and streets, vehicles \nand  burned  objects).  At  the  other  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  not  predominant,  with  a \nshare varying from 10% to 25% of total contributions.  \n\nThe  available  study,  however,  did  not  consider  the  environmental  improvements  implemented  at \nTubarão  Complex  in  recent  years,  as  it  was  completed  before  the  measures  provided  for  in  the \nEnvironmental Commitment Agreement were taken. As a result, for Vale it is essential to carry out \nnew  studies  to  update  and  expand  the  data,  to  determine  the  share  of  different  sources  in  the \ncomposition  of  the  “black  dust”  in  each  region  of  Greater  Vitória and enable strategic management \nof  the  region’s  air  quality.  \n\nThe  company  is  participating  in  new  studies  in  partnership  with  the  State  Public  Prosecution \nMinistry and the State Environment and Water Resources Institute. \n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the company invested R$700 million in environmental controls. As a result \nof  these  investments,  Vale’s  entire  production  system  at  Tubarão Complex, from the arrival of iron \nore  until  its  loading  onto  ships,  is  equipped  with  the  most  modern  environmental  control \ntechnologies.  \n\nThis investment includes the following: the installation of wind fences, pioneering structures in Brazil \nthat reduce the wind speed around piles of iron ore and pellets, cutting the amount of dust carried \ninto the air by 77%; the application of dust polymers and suppressants, products that prevent dust \nemissions  in  piles  of  iron  ore  and  pellets;  the  use  of  new  longer  chutes  on  ship  loaders  to  direct \nproducts  into  vessel  holds;  the  enclosure  of  areas  where  products  are  transferred  from  one \nconveyor belt to another; and the operation of 25 electrostatic precipitators, equipment that is 99% \nefficient in controlling emissions in smokestacks. \n\nTubarão  Complex  also  has  an  Environmental  Control  Center,  which  uses  a  CCTV  system \ncomposed  of  22  continuously  operating  cameras  to  monitor  Vale’s   operations,  in  order  to \npreventively  guarantee  the  effectiveness  of  environmental  controls.  This  enables  immediate \ndecision making, with agility and efficiency, in the event of operational deviations. \n\nVale reiterates its commitment to the environment and the communities of Greater Vitória. \n\nVale  is  fully  willing  to  collaborate  with  the  Parliamentary  Commission  of  Inquiry  about  black  dust \ninstigated by the Legislative Assembly of Espírito Santo in order to investigate particulate emissions \nand their effect on the health of Greater  Vitória’s  people, and it reiterates that it is always open to \ndialogue with society. \n\n8)  Death of two workers in Sudbury, Canada \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Cateme  High  School,  in  turn,  is  designed  for  up  to \naround  650  students  and  has  12  classrooms,  a  library,  accommodation  for  270  students,  and  an \ninformation technology room. \n\nOn July 6, 2012, Vale and the central government signed a memorandum of understanding in order \nto  establish  coordinated  actions  between  the  public  sphere,  the  company  and  community \nrepresentatives  to  maintain  the  existing  infrastructure  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the \ncommunities of Cateme and 25 de Setembro. \n\nThe  following  actions  have  been  carried  out:  maintenance  of  public  drains  and  streets, \nimprovements  to  the  water  supply  system,  expansion  of  the  power  grid,  construction  of  sports \nfacility,  investments  in  agriculture,  development  of  solutions  to  support  public  transport,  and \ninvestments in health, such as the delivery of the 25 de Setembro Health Center and donation of an \nambulance.  \n\nActions  are  being  developed  to  establish  alternative  income  generation  sources,  such  as  the \nfollowing: \n\n  Production  and  sale  of  chickens  to  increase   families’   income.  This  project  has  supported \n197 poultry farmers (109 women and 88 men) who are in full production, making a profit of \nUS$250 to US$350 per batch.  \n\n  Vegetable program,  which  is  designed  to  increase  families’  income  by  growing  and  selling \nvegetables  (tomatoes,  lettuces,  kale,  cabbages,  eggplants,  cucumbers,  peppers  and \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

So far, 61 kits drip-feed  irrigation  systems  have  been  installed  in  the  families’  yards \n(39 belonging to women and 22 to men). \n\n  Cash crop program, benefiting 176 families involved in growing sesame seeds and peanuts. \n\nThese families receive technical assistance from Vale.  \n\n  Home orchard program, aimed  at  increasing  families’  income  by  producing  and  selling  fruit,  \nwhile  encouraging  fruit  consumption  to  improve  the  community’s   diet.  This  program \nbenefited 57 families, by acquiring 2,892 fruit trees (including mango, guava and lemon). \n\n  Development of poultry and horticulture value chain in Cateme, through the installation of a \n\nslaughterhouse and vegetable packing house.  \n\n  Holding  of  vocational  training  courses  on  electricity,  IT  and  construction  for  150  young \n\npeople in Cateme.  \n\nIn  order  to  reinforce  community  dialogue  and  engagement,  and  promote  civic  and  citizenship \nactivities,  Vale  has set up  a number of  community centers. Among  other purposes, these centers \nare  designed  to  share  information,  interests  and  expectations,  build  mutual  trust,  improve \nknowledge of local reality and support the community in finding solutions to demands raised during \nmeetings between the company and residents. The community centers involve the collaboration of \ncommunity  agents,  who  are  members  of  the  community  hired  by  Vale  to  facilitate  community \ndialogue.  \n\nThe actions conducted by Vale in region include the following: \n\n \n\nImplementation of a community radio station: In partnership with the Social Communication \nInstitute,  Vale  has  established  a  community  radio  station  in  Cateme  to  produce  programs \naimed at community development. \n\n  Health: Construction of “Mothers’  Waiting  House,” a building designed to receive pregnant \nwomen  awaiting  birth.  The  Cateme  Health  Center,  which   includes   the   Mothers’   Waiting  \nHouse, serves communities located within a 20-km radius. \n\n  Road  building:  As  a  way  of  supporting  the  communities  and  improving  Cateme’s  \n\naccessibility, Vale built an 8-km paved road, including two bridges. \n\n  Expansion of power grid: In response to community requests, Vale funded the expansion of \n\nthe power grid, to cover all the new neighborhoods of Cateme. \n\n \n\nIncrease  in  water  storage  capacity:  Vale  has  built  two  dams  in  Cateme,  raising  the  water \nstorage  capacity  to  supply  crops  and  livestock.  It  has  also  distributed  drums  to  facilitate \nwater transportation, reducing the amount of time spent on this activity.  \n\n  Promotion  of  livestock  farming:  Vale  donated  150  cattle  to  50  families.  Each  family \nreceived three  animals  (two  oxen  to  be  used  as  draft  animals  and  one  cow  for \nreproduction).  The  company  also  donated  25  Brahman  bulls  to  improve  the  genetics  of \nlocal cattle. \n\n  Training  on  rural  finance:  Around  800  families  have  done  training  on  savings  and  credit, \nleadership,  management  and  business  development,  and  how  to  establish  and  run \nassociations. This training culminated in the formation of eight associations and two unions \nin  the  community  of  Cateme.  The  aim  of  this  training  was  to  ensure  food  security  by \npromoting entrepreneurial  capabilities and skills to create and manage small self-sufficient \nenterprises to generate income. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Na  área  de  carregamento  e  descarregamento,  há  uma  alta  concentração  de  poeira,  que \ncausa a perda da  vegetação na região e coloca em risco a saúde dos habitantes. A partir de um \nestudo  realizado,  o  Instituto  de  Estudos  Sociais  e  Econômicos  Moçambicano  (Iese)  alertou  que \nMoatize  poderá  enfrentar  graves  problemas  de  poluição  atmosférica,  devido  às minas  de  carvão, \nalém  de  constatar  que  a  presença  no  ar  de  poluentes,  como  o  dióxido  de  enxofre,  óxidos  de \nnitrogénio  e  monóxido  de  carbono,  poderá  ser  prejudicial  para  a  saúde  da  população  em  longo \nprazo.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “In  the  district  of  Moatize,  in  Tete  province,  Mozambique,  home  to  one  of  the \nworld’s   largest   coal   deposits,   Vale  S.A.  is  engaged  in  open-pit  coal  mining.  In  the  loading  and \nunloading area, there is a high concentration of dust, causing a loss of vegetation in the region and \nendangering  the  health  of  its  inhabitants.  A  study  carried  out  by  the  Mozambican  Social  and \nEconomic  Study  Institute  (Iese)  warned  that  Moatize  may  suffer  serious  atmospheric  pollution \nproblems due to its coal mines, and found that the presence in the air of pollutants such as sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide  may  be  harmful  to  the  population’s  long-term health.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nWith regard to air quality, we have a real-time monitoring network with stations located inside and \noutside the concession area, measuring emissions levels. To gauge possible emissions arising from \nthe concession area, in April 2015 we set up a station within the community (in the boundary with \nthe concession area). We follow air quality legal standards. We monitor SO2, NO2, O3, PTS, PM10 \nand PM2.5. These parameters record concentrations below the standards at our monitoring station \nlocated  between  the  mining  concession  and  the  community,  indicating  a  low  impact  of  mining \nactivity. On the other hand, the monitoring station located inside the town of Moatize presents high \nlevels of particulate matter, indicating the influence of other activities on these concentrations. The \nconcentrations recorded so far at the station in the boundary of the community and the concession \narea may be associated with the effectiveness of the environmental particulate control measures in \nplace at the mine, namely fixed sprinkler systems in the stockyard, mist cannons at the run of mine \n(ROM)  pad,  sprinkling  of  temporary  access  roads,  and  the  application  of  a  bitumen-based \nbiodegradable   emulsion   called   “Dust-a-Side”   on   permanent   access   roads   to   reduce   particulate  \nmatter emissions. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Contudo,  a  Vale  não  se  responsabiliza  pelos \nacidentes e nem pelas sete mortes ocorridas. Negando, deste modo, sua própria negligência e os \nimpactos  da  intensificação  da  extração  mineral  na  saúde  do  trabalhador.  Para  piorar,  a  empresa \ncostuma culpabilizar as vítimas. \n\nNo processo de intensificação da jornada de trabalho, a Vale conseguiu anular a jornada de turno \nrodízio de seis horas. Este turno garante, minimamente, que, diante de um trabalho desgastante, \ndecorrente  do  revezamento  da  jornada  entre  os  períodos  diurno  e  noturno,  além  de  perigoso  e \ninsalubre  como  o  da  mineração,  os  trabalhadores  consigam  algum  tipo  de  bem-estar  e  tenham \ntempo  livre  fora  das  minas.  O  aumento  da  jornada  de  trabalho  para  oito  horas  resulta  em  mais \nacidentes,  mais  afastamentos  por  problemas  de  saúde  e  no  aumento  de  uma  doença  que  vem \nassolando os trabalhadores mineiros: a depressão.” \n\nEnglish version: “In  Canada,  Minas  Gerais  and  Parauapebas,   labor unions  denounce the under-\nreporting of work accidents, increase in length of working days, high amount of overtime demanded, \nincrease in pressure and  harassment within the company, co-opting of unions, and persecution of \nunion leaders. \n\nIts  2013  Sustainability  Report  mentions  some  accidents  that  occurred  within  its  operational  sites. \nHowever,  Vale  does  not  take  responsibility  for  these  accidents,  nor  for  the  seven  deaths  that \noccurred.  In  this  way,  it  denies  its  own  negligence  and  the  impacts  of  intensification  of  mineral \nextraction  on  workers’  health. To make things worse, the company continues to blame victims. \n\nAs part  of the  working  day intensification  process, Vale has managed to end the six-hour rotating \nshift working day. This system ensures that, given the stress involved in taking turns doing day and \nnight  shifts,  as  well  as  the  dangerous  and  unhealthy  nature  of mining  work,  workers  obtain  some \nkind of wellbeing and have free time away from the mines. The increased length of working days to \neight hours is resulting in more accidents, more leave due to health problems, and growing cases of \na disease that has been ravaging mining workers: depression. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

O  sindicato \nMetabase Inconfidentes, em Minas Gerais, por exemplo, acusa a Vale de engessar as ações dos \nsindicatos e criar empecilhos às tentativas de garantir melhores condições de vida e trabalho. Um \ndos mais recentes casos foi a perseguição a dirigentes, que culminou com a demissão do diretor \nsindical  Vander  Luis  Ferreira,  em  junho  de  2014,  sem  qualquer  justificativa  razoável.  Na  época, \nestavam  ocorrendo  várias  manifestações  de  trabalhadores  e  da  população  em  geral  que \nreivindicavam  condições  básicas  de  trabalho,  segurança,  saúde  e  transporte  nas  localidades  em \nque a Vale e outras mineradoras atuam. O diretor foi penalizado por ter ousado criticar a empresa \ndiante da imprensa. Este tem sido o padrão histórico de atuação da Vale, tanto no Brasil como no \nexterior. Em 2008, o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Indústrias Petroquímicas (Sindiquímica),  do \nParaná[8],  encaminhou  uma  queixa  sobre  as  práticas  antissindicais  da  Vale  para  a  Organização  \nInternacional do Trabalho (OIT). \n\nNa   operação   em   Voisey’s   Bay,   Labrador,   Canadá,   a   relação   entre   a   Vale   e   o   sindicato   não   foi  \ntotalmente reparado, e o legado da greve de 18 meses (2009-2011) continua.  Há relatos de que, \napós o fim da greve, a Vale continua com as práticas de gestão arbitrária no local de trabalho. A \nVale  continua  a  dificultar  a  vida  dos  trabalhadores  através  da  busca  por  acordos  nos  casos  de \nprocessos  e  arbitragem.  O  estilo  de  gestão  da  empresa  Vale  é  muitas  vezes  interpretado  como \numa  estratégia  para  minar  sutilmente  a  força  dos  sindicatos,  e  isolar  a  liderança  sindical  eleita \ndemocraticamente. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

O  Sindicato  Metabase  Carajás,  no  Pará,  é  o  maior \nsindicato mineiro do país e por se localizar no coração da principal mina da Vale possui um papel \nestratégico  para  a  empresa.  A  prática  de  cooptação  da  Vale  no  sindicato  veio  à  tona  em  2014, \nquando, após 20 anos, um grupo de trabalhadores conseguiu inscrever uma chapa para concorrer \nà  presidência  do  sindicato  sem  ser  derrotada  nos  bastidores.  Durante  essas  duas  décadas,  a \nempresa  e  o  próprio  movimento  sindical  cooptado  alegavam  a  inexistência  de  oposição  entre  os \ntrabalhadores, abafando a permissiva influência da empresa e a insatisfação dos trabalhadores.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “Contrary  to  Vale’s  claims,  workers  and  communities  report  a  non-existence  of \ndialogue,  intimidating  practices  and  a  permanent  policy  of  co-opting  the  labor  movement  and  its \nrepresentatives in order to control criticism. The Metabase Inconfidentes union in Minas Gerais, for \nexample,  accuses  Vale  of  stifling  the  actions  of  unions  and  creating  obstacles  to  attempts  to \nguarantee better living and working conditions. One of the most recent cases was the  persecution \nof leaders, which culminated in the dismissal of union director  Vander Luis Ferreira in June 2014, \nwithout  any  reasonable  grounds.  At  the  time,  various  protests  were  taking  place  among  workers \nand  the  general  public  to  demand  basic  working,  safety,  health  and  transport  conditions  in  the \nlocations  where  Vale  and  other  miners  operate.  The  director  was  penalized  for  having  dared  to \ncriticize the company in the press. This  has  been  Vale’s  standard conduct over time, both in Brazil \nand  abroad.  In  2008,  the  Petrochemical  Industry  Workers  Union  (Sindiquímica)  in  Paraná[8] \nsubmitted   a   complaint   about   Vale’s   anti-union  practices  to  the  International  Labor  Organization \n(ILO). \n\nAt  the  operation  in  Voisey’s Bay, Labrador, Canada, relations between Vale and the union were not \ncompletely repaired, and the legacy of the 18-month strike (2009-2011) remains. There are reports \nthat  following  the  end  of  the  strike,  Vale  continues  to  have  arbitrary  management  practices  in  the \nworkplace. Vale  continues  to  hinder  workers’  lives  by  pursuing  agreements  in  cases of lawsuits and \narbitration. The  company’s  management  style  is  often  interpreted as a strategy to subtly undermine \nunions’  power  and  isolate  democratically  elected union leaders. \n\nDisrespect for free association and co-opting of union. The Carajás Metabase Union in Pará is the \nlargest  mining  union  in  the  country,  and  because  it  is  located  at  the  heart  of  Vale’s  main  mine,  it  has  \na strategic role for the company. Vale’s  practice  of  co-opting the union came to light in 2014, when \nafter  20  years  a  group  of  workers  managed  to  register  a  team  of  candidates  to  compete  for  the \nunion’s  presidency  without  being  defeated  behind  the  scenes. Throughout these two decades, the \ncompany  and  the  co-opted  union  movement  itself  alleged  a  lack  of  opposition  among  workers, \nstifling  the  company’s  permissive  influence  and  workers’  dissatisfaction.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nVale rigorously complies with legislation and respects union freedom and collective bargaining.

Além  dos  impactos  ambientais,  há  um \naumento  crescente  do  uso  de  grandes  volumes  de  água  como  insumo  gratuito  pelas  grandes \nmineradoras, especialmente no que se refere aos minerodutos. \n\nA água é o principal insumo do setor da mineração, sendo utilizada no processamento e transporte \ndo minério. Os impactos desta atividade sobre as águas são extremamente graves, englobando a \ndestruição  de  lençóis  de  água  no  subsolo;  piora  na  qualidade  da  água  no  momento  de  sua \ndevolução, em relação à sua retirada; diminuição da sua disponibilidade; e contaminação de rios, \nmares  e  nascentes  com  rejeitos  químicos,  entre  outros.  Desse  modo,  a  mineração  compromete \nnão  apenas  o  uso,  mas  o  acúmulo  e  a  renovação  das  águas,  provocando  o  fim  das  nascentes. \nAlém  dos  impactos  ambientais,  há  um  aumento  crescente  do  uso  de  grandes  volumes  de  água \ncomo  insumo  gratuito  pelas  grandes  mineradoras,  especialmente  no  que  se  refere  aos \nminerodutos. Em apenas uma hora de funcionamento, eles utilizam água suficiente para abastecer \nao menos uma cidade com 500 mil habitantes no mesmo período de tempo. Em 2012, houve mais \noutorgas para o uso de água na mineração do que para a indústria no Brasil. \n\nNo  Canadá,  o  projeto  de  extração  de  níquel  Voisey’s  Bay, da Vale, é bastante polêmico devido à \ncontaminação  do  Lago  Sandy,  que  possui  um  ecossistema  único.  Utilizado  como  local  para \ndespejo de rejeitos, o lago foi convertido em uma bacia com mais de 400 mil toneladas de dejetos, \nde acordo com denúncias de organizações locais. Além da Vale ser ré na maior Ação Civil Pública \nda história do Canadá por  problemas ambientais, ela  foi condenada,  em 2010, ao pagamento  de \ncerca de C$ 36 milhões (dólares canadenses) em indenização para mais de sete mil moradores de \nPort Colborne, em Ontário.  \n\nEm  Minas  Gerais,  berço  da  criação  da  Vale,  são  inúmeros  os  casos  de  conflitos  entre  o  uso  da \nágua  para  as  operações  da  empresa  e  o  abastecimento  da  população.

A expansão desta \nmina  aconteceu  em  2007,  e  a  cava  foi  realizada  muito  perto  da  comunidade  e  da  fonte  de \nabastecimento do distrito. Os moradores já notam que algumas nascentes estão assoreadas e que \na vazão dos cursos  d’água  diminuiu  consideravelmente,  além  dos problemas decorrentes da poeira \nda  mina  e  da  poluição  do  ar  também  terem  se  agravado  muito.  Mesmo  assim,  a  Vale  planeja \nreabrir  a  mina  Tamanduá,  que  estava  fora  de  atividade  há  cerca  de  quinze  anos.  Esta  mina \nlocaliza-se ainda mais próxima da comunidade do Morro da Água Quente, e perigosamente perto \nda  fonte  de  água  que  abastece  a  sede  do  município  de  Catas  Altas.  Ou  seja,  as  duas  fontes  de \nabastecimento  da  cidade  estão  em  risco  devido  às  operações  da  Vale.  Trata-se  da  segurança \nhídrica de mais de cinco mil pessoas.  \n\nOutro  grave  conflito  de  uso  da  água  pela  Vale  se  encontra  no  modal  de  escoamento  dos \nminerodutos, onde a polpa do minério de ferro é bombeada através da água durante 24 horas por \ndia. A Samarco (empresa em que a Vale detém 50% das ações) opera três minerodutos em Minas \nGerais, que saem da mina Alegria, em Mariana, e vão até o porto do Ubu, em Anchieta, no Espírito \nSanto.  Cada  um  deles  possui  mais  de  400  km  de  extensão.  Os  três  minerodutos  gastam  uma \nmédia de 4.400m³/hora. Depois de décadas destruindo os mananciais dos municípios de Mariana e \nOuro Preto, a empresa precisou captar água para os minerodutos e as usinas da Samarco no Rio \nConceição,  localizado  no  distrito  de  Brumal,  na  cidade  de  Santa  Bárbara.  A  adutora  construída \npara estes fins utiliza 82% do potencial hídrico do rio. Moradores da região informam que na época \nda estiagem o rio termina, literalmente, no ponto de  captação para o duto.  É importante ressaltar \nque, em 2010, um dos minerodutos da Samarco rompeu no município de Espera Feliz, causando \num grave desastre ambiental.” \n\nDestruição da Serra do Gandarela e de seus recursos hídricos \n\nHá  7  anos  o  Movimento  pela  Preservação  da  Serra  do  Gandarela,  do  qual  participam  diversas \norganizações e cidadãos de Minas Gerais e de todo o Brasil, atua no enfrentamento às pretensões \nminerárias  da  Vale.  A  Serra  do  Gandarela  abriga  a  última  grande  área  intacta  do  quadrilátero \nferrífero-aquífero e o mais importante aquífero e mananciais de água de alta qualidade da região, \nafluentes das bacias hidrográficas dos rios das Velhas (Bacia do Rio São Francisco) e Piracicaba \n(Bacia  do  Rio  Doce).  Por  esses  motivos,  a  sociedade  civil  organizada  solicitou  a  criação  de  um \nParque  Nacional  e  de  uma  Reserva  de  Desenvolvimento  Sustentável  (RDS).  Desconsiderando  a \nenorme  relevância  ambiental,  paisagística,  científica  e  cultural  da  região,  assim  como  o  amplo \ndebate  social  sobre  o  tema  e  sua  tramitação  no  âmbito  técnico  do  Instituto  Chico  Mendes  de \nConservação  da  Biodiversidade (ICMBio), o  Ministério do Meio Ambiente (MMA) encaminhou  e a \npresidente Dilma Rousseff criou, através de decreto em 13 de outubro de 2014, o Parque Nacional \nda  Serra  do  Gandarela[33],  sem  contemplar  em  sua  demarcação  as  áreas  que  reúnem  o  maior \nnúmero  de  atributos  que  justificam  a  criação  da  Unidade  de  Conservação  federal.  Assim, \ninestimável  patrimônio  socioambiental,  comprometendo \ncolocaram  sob  ameaça  esse \nirremediavelmente  mananciais  essenciais  para  as  cidades  vizinhas,  como  Caeté,  Nova  Lima, \nRaposos,  Rio  Acima,  Santa  Bárbara  e  Barão  de  Cocais,  além  da  última  reserva  estratégica  de \nágua para o abastecimento de Belo Horizonte e sua região metropolitana. Em um período em que \nhá graves ameaças ao abastecimento de água e conflitos de uso na própria região Sudeste, não \nfaz  nenhum  sentido  criar  um  Parque  Nacional  excluindo  de  seus  limites  áreas  de  extrema \nrelevância ambiental e  hídrica. Muito menos permitir nesta área  a exploração mineral pretendida, \nprincipalmente  pela  Vale  com  os  projetos  Apolo,  Piacó  e  Baú.  A  Vale  fez  gestões  para  reduzir  a \nárea  do  Parque  Nacional.  Desde  2007,  a  empresa  insiste  em  concretizar  seus  empreendimentos \nminerários  na  região  e,  para  isso,  já  foram  diversas  as  suas  tentativas  para  ter  a  Mina  Apolo \nlicenciada. Esta empresa, portanto, não respeita a relevância da Serra do Gandarela, nem sequer \nno sentido da garantia de água para milhões de pessoas.” \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts of water \nare used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. \n\nWater  is  the  mining   sector’s   main  input,  and  it  is  used  in  processing  and  transporting  ore.  The \nimpacts  of  this  activity  on  water  are  extremely  serious,  including  the  destruction  of  underground \nwater tables, deterioration of water quality when it is returned compared to when it was extracted, a \nreduction  in  its  availability,  and  contamination  of  rivers,  seas  and  springs  with  chemical  waste, \namong  other  things.  Thus,  mining  harms  not  just  the  use  of  water,  but  also  its  accumulation  and \nrenewal, causing an end to springs. Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts \nof water are used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. In just one hour \nof  operation,  these  pipelines  use  enough  water  to  supply  a  city  of  at  least  500,000  inhabitants \nduring  this  period.  In  2012,  there  were  more  permits  for  water  use  in  mining  than  in  industry  in \nBrazil. \n\nIn Canada, Vale’s  Voisey’s  Bay nickel mining project is very controversial due to the contamination \nof  Sandy  Pond,  which  had  a  unique  ecosystem.  Used  as  a  dumping  ground  for  waste,  the  pond \nwas  converted  into  a  basin  containing  more  than  400,000  metric  tons  of  waste,  according  to \ncomplaints from local organizations. As well as  Vale being the defendant in the largest public civil \nlawsuit  in   Canada’s   history   for   environmental  problems,  in  2010  it  was  sentenced  to  pay  around \nC$36 million (Canadian dollars) as compensation to more than 7,000 residents of Port Colborne in \nOntario.  \n\nIn Minas Gerais, Vale’s  birthplace,  there are numerous cases of conflicts between the use of water \nfor the company’s  operations  and  to  supply  the  population. In the municipality of Catas Altas, Vale \nextracts  iron  ore  from  São  Luiz  Mine  in  the  district  of  Morro  da  Água  Quente.  This  mine  was \nexpanded  in  2007,  and  mining  has  since  taken  place  very  near  the  community   and   the   district’s  \nwater  supply  source.  Residents  have  noted  that  some  springs  are  silting  up  and  that  the  flow  of \nwatercourses has reduced considerably. In addition, problems arising  from  the  mine’s  dust  and  air  \npollution have also become much worse. Despite this, Vale plans to reopen Tamanduá Mine, which \nwas  inactive  for  around  15  years.  This mine  is  located  even  closer  to  the  community  of  Morro  da \nÁgua  Quente,  and  dangerously  near  the  water  source  that  supplies  the  main  town  in  the \nmunicipality of Catas Altas. In  other  words,  the  town’s  two  water  sources  are  jeopardized  by  Vale’s  \noperations. The water security of more than 5,000 people is at stake. \n\nAnother serious conflict  regarding  Vale’s  water  use  is  found  in  its ore slurry pipelines, in which iron \nore slurry is pumped using water for 24 hours a day. Samarco (a company in which Vale has a 50% \nstake) operates three ore slurry pipelines in Minas Gerais, from Alegria Mine in Mariana to the Port \nof  Ubu  in  Anchieta,  Espírito  Santo.  Each  of  these  pipelines  is  more  than  400  km  long.  The  three \npipelines consume an average of  4,400 m³ of water per hour. After decades destroying springs in \nthe municipalities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, the company needed to extract water for  Samarco’s \nore  slurry  pipelines  and  plants  from  the  Conceição  River,  located  in  the  district  of  Brumal,  in  the \nmunicipality  of  Santa  Bárbara.  The  water pipe built for this  purpose uses  82%  of  the  river’s   water \npotential. Residents of the region say that in the dry season, the river literally dries up completely at \nthe   water   pipe’s   inflow   point.  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  2010,  one  of  Samarco’s   ore   slurry  \npipelines burst in the municipality of Espera Feliz, causing a major environmental disaster. \n\nDestruction of Gandarela Hills and their water resources \n\nFor  seven  years,  the  Movement  to  Preserve  the  Gandarela  Hills,  featuring  the  involvement  of \nvarious organizations and citizens from Minas Gerais and across Brazil, has been fighting against \nVale’s  mining  plans. The Gandarela Hills are home to the last large intact area of the ‘iron-aquifer \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

For these reasons, organized civil  society requested the creation  of a National  Park \nand  a  Sustainable  Development  Reserve.  Disregarding   the   region’s   enormous   environmental, \nlandscape, scientific and cultural relevance, as well as extensive social debate about the topic and \nits processing within the technical scope of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation \n(ICMBio),  the  Environment  Ministry  submitted  plans  for,  and  President  Dilma  Rousseff  created, \nthrough  a  decree  on  October  13,  2014,  the  Gandarela  Hills  National  Park[33],  without  including \nwithin its boundaries the areas with the largest number of attributes that justified the creation of the \nfederal Conservation Unit. Thus, they endangered this priceless social and environmental heritage, \nirreparably  harming  essential  water  sources  for  neighboring  municipalities,  such  as  Caeté,  Nova \nLima, Raposos, Rio Acima, Santa Bárbara and Barão de Cocais, as well as the last strategic water \nreserve to supply Belo Horizonte and its metropolitan region. At a time when there are serious water \nsupply   threats   and   usage   conflicts   in   Brazil’s   Southeast   region,  it  does  not  make  any  sense  to \ncreate  a  National  Park  whose  boundaries  exclude  areas  of  extreme  environmental  and  water \nresource  relevance.  It  makes  even  less  sense  to  permit  mining  exploration  there,  especially  that \nplanned  by  Vale  through  its  Apolo,  Piacó  and  Baú  projects.  Vale  made  efforts  to  reduce  the \nNational   Park’s   area.  Since  2007,  the  company  has  been  insisting  on  implementing  its  mining \nprojects in the region, and to this end it has made various attempts to get Apolo Mine licensed. This \ncompany, therefore, does not respect the importance of the Gandarela Hills, not even to guarantee \nwater for millions of people.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nApolo Project \n\nVale  began  studies  for  the  Apolo  Project  around  2006,  conducting  hydrogeological  studies  that \nsupported  the  respective  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  in  its  diagnosis  and  prognosis  of  the \nproject’s   impacts   on   the   region’s   water   resources.  The  results  of  these  studies  indicate  that  the \nApolo Project will not harm the water supply of Belo Horizonte and adjacent cities, and any impacts \nwill  be  duly  mitigated  in  line  with  prevailing  environmental  legislation  and  demands  by  the \nenvironmental licensing authority. \n\nThe Apolo Project’s  area  is  home  to  the water supply sources for the cities of Barão de Cocais and \nCaeté,  and  part  of  the  city  of  Belo  Horizonte.  The  main  allegation  against  the  project  among \norganized civil society is that there are several springs in its area of influence and that this is likely \nto affect the water supply of part of the local population. \n\nAlso regarding water supply issues, considering the study to evaluate water availability in the basins \nof the upper stretches of the Velhas and Paraopeba rivers, which are home to springs that feed the \nmetropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, COPASA’s  water  extraction  facility  from  the Velhas River is \nlocated around 7 km upstream from where it is joined by the Prata Stream, which is the watercourse \ninfluenced by the Apolo Project’s  implementation  area. \n\nTherefore, we  clarify  that  the  project’s  area  of  influence  is  not  related  to  the  water  extraction  points  \nused for the water supply in question. In addition, all water withdrawal points that currently supply \nthe metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte are located in areas of influence of mining projects, but no \nimpacts by these projects  on  water stocks allocated for public supply  have  ever been detected or \nforecast.  We  also  stress  that  in  our  environmental  controls,  we  have  also  created  an  extensive \nnetwork to monitor indicators, such as the quality and flow of watercourses. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Since then, the project has not moved forward. It is currently suspended. \n\nIt is important to note that Vale will only start implementing the Apolo Project once its environmental \nlicense has been duly approved, and in accordance with prevailing environmental legislation. \n\nCatas Altas \n\nIn 2010, Vale obtained an operating license to expand its activities at São Luiz Mine. \n\nVale clarifies that its activities do not interfere with water extraction points used to supply the district \nof Morro da Água Quente  and Catas Altas, which are found upstream  from  the  mine’s  operations. \nThe company monitors the flow and quality of water in the watercourses located around the project. \nThe  results  of  this  monitoring  have  been  in  accordance  with  the  parameters  determined  by \nlegislation. \n\nWith regard to particulate matter emissions, the company takes measures to control dust and it has \nan  air  quality  monitoring  network  to  measure  particulate  levels  in  the  area  around  the  operation. \nThe monitoring results have been within the limits determined by legislation. \n\nAll this monitoring work is officially registered with the environmental authority, in accordance with \nthe  operating  license’s  conditions. \n\nSamarco \n\n The   water   resource   management   is   a   fundamental   issue   on   Samarco’s   operations   and   plans.  \nSeveral  studies  and  project  have  being  developed  in  order  to  adopt  more  sustainable  practices. \nThis  work  is  oriented  by  the  aims  of  optimize  and  rationalize  the  water  use,  reduce  the  need  of \nmake-up  water,  increase  recirculation  water  rate  and  ensure  the  water  quality  discarded  to \nenvironment. \n\nIt’s   important   to   highlight   that   Samarco   does   not   withdraw   water   specifically   to   feed   the   pipelines.  \nThe water to the transport came from iron ore processing withdraw. So, regardless the pipeline, the \nwithdraw water is necessary due the industrial process nature. Part of water is treated and returns \nto water bodies close to company with quality level according the law requirements. About 90% of \nwater demanded by Samarco is recycled and the part used on pipeline is separated and used again \nin the pelletizing process in Espírito Santo. Those initiatives avoid, in large scale, the need of new \nwithdraw out of the environment. Nowadays Samarco uses 1632m3/h of water to transport ore pulp \nand not 4400m3/h as described. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAll   Samarco’s   withdraw   is   conducted   according   the   standards   established   by   the   authorizations  \nissued  for  the  competent  environmental  agency  after  conducted  studies  attesting  the  viability. \nSamarco has permits in five different places in order to avoid water stress in a particular place. \n\nThe  water  withdrawal  on  Santa  Bárbara  river  is  part  of  its  strategy  and  started  with  the  third \nconcentration plant operation launched on April 2014. The information about the use of 82% of the \nriver  capacity  is  unfounded.  According  to  the  IGAM  Ordinance  nº49/2010,  article  5º,  §1º,   “The \nmaximum limit of consumption withdraws to be permitted in the portion of water basing limited for a \nconsidered section, in natural conditions, will be 30% of Q7,10 (minimum flow rate in 7 (seven) days \nand  10  (ten)  years  of  recurrence)  being  assured  downstream  of  the  withdraw  minimum  residual \nflows  equal  of  70%  of  the  Q7,10”.  So,  the  water  used  by  Samarco  doesn’t  restrict others withdraws \nin  different  points  of  Santa  Bárbara  river.  As  established  by  the  law  above    on  that  specific  point \nwould be  allowed  withdraw of 3467m3/h and Samarco is allowed to  withdraw up to 2050m3/h, as \nthe flow rate defined by the permit – “Portaria  de  Outorga  Nº01323/2001”.   \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  in  2012  was  published  the  Resolution  SEMAD-IGAM  nº1548,  March \n29th, 2012 changing the permitted withdraw flow rate to 50% of Q7,10. On this conditions would be \nallowed to withdraw 5778m3/h on that point of Santa Bárbara river. \n\nThe  Federal  law  13199/99  (National  law  of  waters)  item  I,  Art.  3º  established  “the  right  of  access  of  \nall   to   water   resources,   priority   to   public   supply   and   ecosystem   maintenance”.   So   the   Samarco’s  \nwithdraws do not compete with human supply. In 38 years of pipelines operation there is no records \nof conflicts for water use in the neighborhood of company operations. \n\nRelated to the pipeline leaking in 2010 it should be noticed this is a localized occurrence identified \nand treated by the company with agility and transparency. \n\nSamarco,  immediately  after  the  identification  of  the  occurrence  informed  and  involved  the \ncompetent  authorities  and  took  care  of  all  work  to  rehabilitate  the  area.  The  action  was  properly \nfollowed  by  the  competent  authority  and  received  the  municipality  formal  recognition  for  the \ncompany responsibility and especially for the way of conduction the actions related to the fact. \n\nVoyces Bay \n\nVale is committed to long term sustainable development  – Vale’s  approach to sustainability entails \nbalancing environmental, social and economic factors from a macro perspective to achieve a result \nthat prioritizes the greater good and the best interests of the communities in which it operates.  The \noutcomes  of  the  Sandy  Pond  and   Port   Colborne   legal   matters   demonstrate   Vale’s   respect   for   the  \nenvironment and record of compliance with prevailing laws and regulations.  \n\nSandy Pond  \n\nThe  “Sandy  Pond  Alliance  for  the  Protection  of  Canadian  Waters”  filed an Application in the Federal \nCourt of Canada in June 2010  asking that  the  Metal  Mining Effluent  Regulations (\"MMER\")  under \nthe Fisheries Act, which permit the use of a lake or pond as a Tailings Impoundment Area (\"TIA\"), \nbe  declared  void  and  unlawful.  The  Application  does  not  seek  a  specific  remedy  or  order  against \nVale  but  rather  named  the  Government  of  Canada  and  challenged  the  Government  decision  to \nenact certain MMER provisions. The Sandy Pond Alliance position was that the Fisheries Minister \nand the Cabinet were not authorized under the Fisheries Act to enact regulations which permit the \nuse  of  a  fish  habitat  (i.e.,  a  lake  or  pond)  for  tailings,  the  result  of  which  is  the  destruction  of \nfreshwater aquatic life in the habitat. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The status of this matter is that the Sandy Pond Alliance \napplication was rejected by the Court without impact to Vale.   \n\nThe  Sandy  Pond  site  emerged  as  the  clear  and  most  responsible  selection  after  detailed \nexamination and comparison of several possible sites for the RSF.  A requirement related to the use \nof  Sandy  Pond  is  the  protection  of  fish  and  fish  habitat  under  the  Fisheries  Act  of  Canada.  The \nDepartment  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans   (DFO)   operates   on   the   “No   Net   Loss”   principle:   any   loss   of  \nproductive  fish  habitat  has  to  be  offset  in  an  acceptable  manner  so  that  there  is  no  net  loss  in \ncapacity.  Fish  habitat  can  be  altered  only  if  authorized  by  the  Minister  of  Fisheries.  Such \nauthorization  is  granted  only  if  an  acceptable  Fish  Habitat  Compensation  Plan  is  in  place  and  a \nbinding agreement is reached on its implementation. \n\nVale has legally relocated the freshwater aquatic life from Sandy Pond and continues to responsibly \nuse  Sandy  Pond   as   a   residue   storage   site   for   Vale’s   Long   Harbour   processing   plant   operations.    \nThis  is  all  in  accordance  with  prevailing  laws  and  regulations.    The  Sandy  Pond  residue  storage \nfacility (RSF) is one of 19 authorized impoundment areas in Canada. \n\nPCR Class Action Lawsuit \n\nA  class  action  lawsuit  in  Ontario  court  alleged  that  historic  emissions   from   Vale’s   Port   Colborne  \nrefinery had resulted in elevated nickel levels in the soil  and adversely affected property values of \nneighboring properties.  Vale acknowledged that there is nickel in the soil and that the majority of it \ncame  from  the  historical  (pre-1960)  operation  of  the  nickel  refinery  in  Port  Colborne.  Vale  put \nforward the position that the refinery was at all times operated in compliance with the environmental \nregulation  of  the  day  and  that  the  level  of  nickel  in  soil  was  below  the  standards  set  to  protect \nhuman health.  \n\nAt trial, the judge awarded damages to the Class Action plaintiffs in the amount of CDN$36 million \nplus  legal  costs.  This  decision  was  subsequently  reversed  by  the  Ontario  Court  of  Appeal, \naccepting  all  of  Vale’s  positions.  Thus  no  payment  by  Vale  to the Plaintiffs was required.  \n\nVale  recognizes  the  historical  soil  contamination  and  has  worked  to  undertake  Risk  Assessments \n(RAs),  as  required  by  the  Ontario  Ministry  of  the  Environment  (MOE).  The  RAs  evaluated  human \nhealth risk, ecological risk and risk to agricultural crops.  The studies provided further evidence that \nthe level of soil contamination does not represent a health risk to the  community.  The  MOE’s  review  \nof  Vale’s  RAs  is  ongoing.  Vale  continues  to  implement  its  risk  management  plan  to  address  areas  \nwith higher nickel soil contamination. \n\n17)  Xikrin: compensation programs \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “No  Pará,  o  povo  Xikrin  realizou  diversos  protestos  em  2014.

During  one  of \nthem, the  entrance  to  Vale’s  Onça Puma project in the Ourilândia do Norte region was blocked and \nproduction  halted.  The  indigenous  people  allege  that  nickel  mining  is  causing  extensive  harm  to \npeople’s   health   and   affecting   the   Cateté  River,  which  serves  the  community.  According  to  the \nFederal Prosecution Ministry, despite the health impacts on the Xikrin people, Vale has not begun \nany  compensation  program  and  has  not  complied  with  any  of  the  established  conditions.  Another \nVale  project,  the  Salobo  copper  extraction  project,  is  also  causing  negative  consequence  for  this \nsame people, by affecting areas where they collect nuts. For this reason, Salobo is the object of a \npublic civil inquiry under way at the Federal Prosecutor’s  Office  in  Marabá, Pará.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nOnça Puma \n\nAll  the  stages  of  the  Onça  Puma  project  were  planned  so  as  to  prevent  and  safeguard  the \nindigenous  people  and  their  territories  from  any  negative  consequences  that  may  arise  from  its \nimplementation or during its operational phase.  \n\nVale  also  understands  that,  following  the  completion  of  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté  Ethno-Ecological \nStudies,  which  detailed  the  impacts  on  these  indigenous  areas  more  directly,  and  proposed \nmitigating  actions,  strategies  and  measures  for  them,  any  detailed  information  needed  for  the \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA-RIMA)  has  already  been  supplied.  Based  on  the  impacts \nidentified  in  this  study,  a  Basic  Environmental  Plan  featuring  appropriate  mitigation  programs  was \nproduced  with  the  indigenous  community  participation.  However,  the  indigenous  people  are  not \nallowing  the  programs  that  were  defined,  with  their  participation  and  decision,  to  be  implemented \nwithin their indigenous land. They want extra financial resources to be paid by the company for their \nconsumption needs. The mitigation plan is established to have the financial resources being applied \nin  environmental  conservation,  health,  safety  improvement,  land  securing  and  monitoring,  cultural \nstrengthening  and  productive  activities,  in  an  equitable  way.  They  are  not  supposed  to  pay  for \ncosting  and  acquisition  of  consumer  goods  that  have  no  correlation  with  the  impacts  and  often \ngenerate  new  negative  impacts  to  these  populations,  including  their  socio-cultural  aspects  and \nhealth.   The direct financial transfer is not either equitably distributed by them. Therefore, some get \nmore  resources  than  others,  generating  new  internal  ruptures.  The  simple  increase  of  resources \nposes more threat to these people. A strong long term sustainable plan with good governance and \nmanagement  is  needed.    Vale  has  been  conducting  all  the  activities  outside  the  indigenous  land \ndefined in the Basic Environmental Plan, including the following: (i) Monitoring of water quality in the \nXikrin do Cateté indigenous land (monitoring of concentrations of heavy metals that could affect the \nindigenous  people’s  health);;  and  (ii)  Actions  to  mitigate  the  silting of the Cateté River (proposal for \nstructures to control this silting). This monitoring work has shown no change in turbidity that could \ninfluence   the   water   body’s   visual   characteristics.   Regarding   heavy   metals,   the   anomalies   found  \n(higher  concentrations)  are  related  to  regional  and/or  local  geology,  including  hydro-chemical \nprocesses,  water-rock  interactions,  the  time  that  water  spends  in  the  aquifer,  and  speed  of \ninfiltration. \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  since  1982  Vale  has  provided  support  to  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté \nindigenous  people,  complementing  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  Brazilian  state,  providing \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The project is fully \nsituated inside the Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest, a conservation unit protected by the competent \nenvironmental  authority,  and  human  occupation  in  the  location  is  prohibited.  Due  to  the \nconsiderable distance between the project and the indigenous villages where the  Xikrin do Cateté \npeople  live,  as  well  as  the  strict  environmental  control  systems  inherent  to  the  project,  these \ncircumstances  allow  us  to  affirm  that  there  are  no  significant  impacts  on  the  physical,  biotic  and \nsocioeconomic  environment  affecting  the  indigenous  land.  Discussions  have  been  held  with  the \nXikrin do Cateté people since the start of the Salobo Project. Although  they  did  not  use  the  project’s  \narea  before  it  began,  their  use  of  this  area  has  since  been  facilitated,  thereby  expanding  their \noptions  for  collecting  nuts  –  a  traditional  activity  that  the  company  now  supports  annually  on  a \nvoluntary basis. \n\n18)  Mãe Maria Indigenous Land \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “Em  2015,  o  MPF  pediu  à  Justiça  Federal  que  obrigue  a  mineradora \nVale a voltar imediatamente a dar apoio à saúde dos indígenas da Terra Indígena Mãe Maria, em \nBom Jesus do Tocantins, no sudeste do Pará. A empresa suspendeu o atendimento de saúde aos \nindígenas  após  uma  manifestação  realizada  próxima  à  EFC.

Nevertheless, it maintained emergency services for the indigenous people as well \nas  treatments  under  way  and  high-complexity  or  high-cost  specialist  treatments.

The  three  villages  without  Agreements  in  place  are  receiving  urgent  and \nemergency services, as well as high-complexity or high-cost specialist  treatments,  reflecting  Vale’s  \ncommitment  to  respect  the  communities  it  interacts  with,  in  order  to  promote  the  development  of \nlasting  and  healthy  relations  with  the  Gavião  people.  At  no  time  has  Vale  refused  to  engage  in \ndialogue  with  the  Gavião  people,  and  we  have  always  respected  their  culture  and  social \norganization. \n\n19)  Biopalma \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Seguindo a lógica do marketing verde, em 2011, a Vale comprou 70% \nda  empresa  Biopalma  da  Amazônia  S.A.

A  destinação  principal  do  óleo  é  a  produção  de  biodiesel  pela  Vale  para \nalimentar sua frota de locomotivas, máquinas e os equipamentos de grande porte das operações \nno  Brasil.  No  entanto,  a  Biovale  é  denunciada  por  conflitos  territoriais,  desmatamento  e \ncontaminação  por  agrotóxicos  de  igarapés,  que  alimentam  inúmeros  rios  da  região.  Em  2014,  o \nInstituto  Evandro  Chagas  comprovou  a  contaminação  por  agrotóxico  em  plantações  de  dendê, \nregistradas em um relatório de perícia feita nos municípios de São Domingos do Capim, Concórdia \ndo  Pará, Bujaru  e  Acará.  Além disso, desde 2008 quilombolas de Concórdia,  no  Pará, acusam a \nterras,  ameaçando-os  com \nempresa  de  pressionar  agricultores  para  venderem  suas \ndesapropriações e índios Tembé do território Turé-Mariquita denunciam os impactos das atividades \nda empresa em suas terras, através da contaminação por agrotóxicos, tendo os índios apreendido, \nem protesto, em 2014, oito carros e tratores da Biopalma.

However,  Biovale  has  been  denounced  for \nterritorial  conflicts,  deforestation  and  pesticide  contamination  of  streams   feeding   the   region’s  \nnumerous rivers. In 2014, The Evandro Chagas Institute found pesticide contamination in palm tree \nplantations, as recorded in a report by a specialist produced in the municipalities of São Domingos \ndo  Capim,  Concórdia  do  Pará,  Bujaru  and  Acará.  Furthermore,  since  2008  members  of  a \nquilombola community in Concórdia, Pará, have accused the company of pressuring farmers to sell \ntheir  lands,  threatening  them  with  expropriation,  and  Tembé  indigenous  people  in  the  Turé-\nMariquita  territory   have   complained   about   the   impacts   of   the   company’s   activities   on   their   lands, \nthrough  pesticide  contamination.  In  2014,  these  indigenous  people  seized  eight  cars  and  tractors \nbelonging  to  Biopalma  in  protest.  In  other  words,  behind  the  image  of  a  company  that  is \nsustainable, responsible and concerned about future generations, there lies the same old practice \nof usurping and neglecting territories and communities. With regard to food prices, notwithstanding \nfactors  such  as  seasonal  situations,  crop  failures  and  sales  obstacles,  the  technical  supervisor  of \nthe Pará Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese), Roberto Sena, \nbelieves there is a relationship between the advance of palm trees and the rise in food prices.The \nproblem of family farming is the lack of a production policy; people have stopped growing cassava \nin  favor  of  palm  trees,’  he  says.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nBiopalma operates strictly according to labor and environmental legislation, and it clarifies that it has \nhad access to the “Technical report to evaluate surface water and bottom sediment located in areas \npotentially  impacted  by  palm  oil  tree  cultivation  in  the  municipalities  of  Concórdia  do  Pará  and \nBujaru,” produced by the Evandro Chagas Institute. This document does not contain any evidence \nof  pesticide-contaminated  surface  water,  and  its  analyses  of  sediments  detected  residues  of  DDT \nand Endossulfan – products that are not used by Biopalma. \n\nThe  company  emphasizes  that  it  does  not  have  any  activities  inside  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion.  Despite  this,  it  carries  out  sustainable  projects  to  support  the  indigenous  community, \nfocused  on  education,  health, \nfood  security,  basic  sanitation,  maintenance,  and  access \ninfrastructure.  For  example,  the  company  has  equipped  a  health  center  and  installed  micro  water \nsupply  facilities,  among  other  things,  all  in  accordance  with  the  ethno-environmental  report \nproduced in 2011 and updated in August 2012, and under Funai’s  supervision. \n\nIt should be noted that despite the actions taken by Biopalma to support the indigenous community \nof the Turé Mariquita territory, on December 24, 2014 indigenous person Lucinho Tembé began to \nlead  a  series  of  illegal  actions  against  the  company,  including  the  unlawful  seizure  of  vehicles, \ninterruptions of activities, threats to company employees, and theft of objects and fuel. In exchange \nfor the seized goods, the indigenous people presented a series of demands, which included, among \nother materials items, a monthly transfer of cash unconnected to any actions. The goods were only \nrecovered by Biopalma following a court ruling by the judge of the Second Federal Court of Belém. \nWe  emphasize  that  there  is  no  proof  of  any  impacts  caused  by  Biopalma’s   activities   on   the  \nindigenous territory. In addition, the study conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute did not cover \nthe municipality of Tome Açu, where the indigenous community in question is located. \n\nThus,  the  Federal  Prosecution  Ministry  filed  Injunction  in  order  to  investigate  the  alleged \ncontamination  of  the  indigenous  territory.  Biopalma  was  summoned  and  it  presented  its  defense. \nFollowing the legal procedures, the lawsuit was dismissed  by the judge of the Ninth Federal Court \nof Belém. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The  indigenous  leaders  have  presented  their  claims  and  Biopalma  is  evaluating \ntheir  pertinence in relation  to their areas of activity, namely  education, health, food security,  basic \nsanitation, maintenance, and access infrastructure. At the moment there are no direct conflicts.  \n\nRegarding the allegation of deforestation,  it should be noted that the  Biopalma project has a  zero \nrate of deforestation, as it is exclusively planting palm trees in areas already altered, in line with the \nobligations  arising  from  environmental  legislation  and  the  company’s   objectives  and  principles  to \nconserve the biodiversity and ecosystem around it. As a result, the company is maintaining natural \nareas  of  habitat,  thereby  contributing  to  environmental  balance  and  the  conservation  of  natural \nresources in the region. \n\nIn the last six (6) months, it was identified that the  company’s  areas  allocated for “Reserva Legal”  \nsites  (legally  mandated  minimum  areas  of  native  habitat)  and/or  considered  Permanent \nPreservation  areas  have  been  systematically  invaded  for  illegal  logging,  especially  in  the \nmunicipalities of Acará, Tomé Açú and Concórdia do Pará. \n\nIn order to reduce incidents of illegal logging, Biopalma filed crime reports at the police station in the \nmunicipality where each property in question is located, and made a request to the Pará Specialist \nEnvironmental Police Department (DEMA) to launch a police inquiry to put a definitive end to such \nactions,  which  harm  not  only  the  company,  but  society  as  a  whole.  Biopalma  has  also  reported \nthese cases to the environmental authorities.  As a result of the measures taken by  Biopalma, the \nCivil  Police  have  already  carried  out  two  operations  in  the  region,  culminating  in  the  seizure  of \nillegally extracted timber.  \n\nRegarding the aforementioned territorial conflicts, Biopalma states that at no time has it made any \nkind  of  threats  to  rural  farmers  located  in  the  region  to  sell  their  lands,  and  it  has  certainly  not \nundertaken  any  planting  work  and/or  acquired  properties  belonging  to  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion. As stated before, Biopalma has been planting in already degraded areas. \n\nWith  regard  to  the  conflict  with  the  quilombola  community,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  request  to \ndemarcate  the  Amarqualta  quilombola  territory  was  filed  in  2011,  after  Biopalma  acquired  the \nproperties.  As  soon  as  it  became  aware  of  the  request  for  quilombola  demarcation,  the  company \nsuspended the planting of palm trees in the contested area and began to monitor the demarcation \nprocess with the Pará Land Institute (ITERPA), the body responsible for the process of demarcating \nquilombola  territory.  Alongside  the  administrative  process  under  way  at  ITERPA,  the  State  Public \nProsecution Ministry instigated a public civil inquiry to investigate the claims made by the members \nof the quilombola community regarding the activities of palm tree-growing companies, particularly in \nterms of land conflicts involving an area that is awaiting land title. Because of these administrative \nprocesses, Biopalma has had several meetings with ITERPA, the quilombola communities and the \nState  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  to  resolve  the  situation  through  negotiation.  At  the  moment,  the \nvalidity  of  the  land  titles  for  overlapping  properties  claimed  by  Biopalma  and  ITERPA  is  being \nevaluated. \n\nLaunched  in  February  2010,  Biopalma’s   Family   Farming   Program  consists  of  a  partnership  to \nproduce  palm  oil  fruit  with  rural  farming  families  in  northeast  Pará.  The  farmers  are  funded  via \nBanco  da  Amazônia,  Banco  do  Brasil  and  Banco  do  Estado  do  Pará  (Banpará),  with  credit  lines \nsupplied  by  the  National  Program  to  Strengthen  Family  Farming  (PRONAF  –  ECO  DENDÊ),  a \nfederal  government  program  to  acquire  saplings,  maintain  plantations  and  grant  financial  support \nfor subsistence needs in the first three years after planting until the first crops are harvested. \n\nAround  650  families  are  partners  of  this  Biopalma  program,  dedicating  part  of  their  lands  to  palm \ntree  plantations  and  receiving  technical  assistance,  as  well  as  guaranteed  purchases  of  raw \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n35 \n\n \n \n \n\fmaterials  for  30  years  of  production.  Farmers  already  at  the  harvesting  stage,  i.e.  at  least  three \nyears  after  planting,  have  seen  a  significant  increase  in  their  purchasing  power,  which  is  also \nresulting in growth in the acquisition of goods and services in  the  program’s  areas of influence. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  to  strengthen  family  farming  among  the  producers  served  by  the  program, \nBiopalma  conducts  monitoring  and  provides  technical  support  needed  for  the  families  to  develop \ntheir agricultural production, given that they also grow other crops on the same property. \n\nOne  of  the  ways  used  to  encourage  families  to  plant  a  variety  of  crops  is  the  “Productivity  Trio,” a \nprogram  formalized  through  a  partnership  between  Biopalma  and  Embrapa  that  involves  a \ncombination of three components of a cassava production system and their application at the family \nproperties in question.  \n\nThe Productivity Trio has the capacity to  use the spaces between  the rows of palm trees to grow \ncassava  roots  without  harming  the  perfect  plant  development  of  the  palm  trees.  The  Productivity \nTrio  has  been  implemented  in  cleared  areas  where  the  slash  and  burn  technique  had  previously \nbeen usual. By using the Trio system, it has been possible to double cassava yields  without using \nfertilizer, by focusing on using the best spacing to plant seedlings, clearing the areas and selecting \ncassava seedlings. As the planted palm trees take  three  years to begin producing fruit, and given \nthat cassava crops are the foundation of family farming in the area, cassava is grown between the \nrows of palm trees, in line with the following principles: \n\n  Non-encouragement of monoculture in family farming; \n\n  Diversification  of  production,  given  that  many  other  crops  besides  cassava  may  be \nintercropped (including corn, rice, beans and  watermelon), provided that technical spacing \ncriteria are followed, as guided by Biopalma’s  technical  team; \n\n  Guaranteed food security for the families benefited by Biopalma’s  Family  Farming  Program; \n\n  Guaranteed income even before oil palm fruit production begins,  given that the palm trees \n\ncomplement income produced by other food crops (beans, corn, rice and fruits). \n\nBiopalma  is  a  company  with  the  mission  to  produce  palm  oil  and  byproducts  in  a  sustainable \nmanner.  Our  operational  excellence  makes  us  a  leading  company  in  the  market,  and  this \nrecognition  has  only  been  possible  thanks  to  work  performed  with  respect  for  safety  and  the \nenvironment. \n\n20)  Belo Monte \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Um dos projetos mais polêmicos em que a Vale está envolvida, na sua \ncrescente busca por energia, é a construção da usina hidrelétrica de Belo Monte na Volta Grande \ndo Rio Xingu, no estado do Pará.

Major  delays  in  construction  and  constant  cost  increases \ndemonstrate that Belo Monte is not economically viable, as social movements have been saying for \ndecades.” \n\nVale’s Response \n\nIn March 2015, Vale transferred its 9% stake in Norte Energia Participações S.A. (the Belo Monte \nhydroelectric  power  plant)  to  Aliança  Norte  Energia  Participações  (Aliança  Norte),  a  joint  venture \nbetween Vale and Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nVale now indirectly holds a 4.59% interest in Belo Monte, while Cemig GT has a 4.41% stake in the \nproject through Aliança Norte. This  reduction  in  Vale’s  interest  in  Belo Monte is in line with its global \nstrategy  to  focus  on  its  core  business,  without  harming  the  availability  of  electric  power  for  its \noperations. \n\nThrough  Aliança  Norte,  Vale  appoints  one  member  and  a  respective  alternate  member  to  Norte \nEnergia’s   Board   of   Directors,   with   the   right   to   one   vote   at   meetings,   where   subjects   need   to   be  \napproved  by  a  vote  of  at  least  eight  members.  Vale  and  Cemig  GT  alternately  appoint  Aliança \nNorte’s   member   of   the   Board   of   Directors   every   three   years,   as   determined   in   Aliança   Norte’s  \nshareholders agreement. \n\nEnvironmental and social issues, among other strategic topics, are discussed by the Environmental \nAdvisory  Committee,   whose   members   are   appointed   by   Norte   Energia’s   shareholders.   Vale,  \nthrough  Aliança  Norte,  appoints  one  representative  to  this  committee  and  a  respective  alternate \nmember  until  the  end  of  the  Belo  Monte  hydroelectric  project’s  implementation  phase.  Starting from \nthe  operational  phase,  Cemig  GT  and  Vale  will  then  alternately  appoint  their  representative  every \nthree   years.   The   committee’s   main   objective   is   to   analyze   social   and   environmental   subjects   and  \nrecommend  whether  or  not  to  approve  measures  to  Norte  Energia’s   Board   of   Directors,   which   is  \ncomposed of 12 members appointed by shareholders \n\nNorte  Energia  provides  frequent  information  on  their  site.  It  is  important  mentioning  that  over  the \ncourse  of  its  planning,  the   plant’s   design   was   profoundly   modified  in  order  to  restrict  its  potential \nimpacts   on   the   environment   and   the   region’s   population.

Of this total, it will be \nnecessary to deforest  156 km2 (27%), because the remainder of the area consists of the riverbed \nand non-native vegetation  formations, such as pastureland, areas of crops, and mineral extraction \nsites. \n\nThe Belo Monte project has taken necessary precautions not to flood any indigenous lands and  to \navoid impacts in implementing the construction of sites, access roads, dam and other engineering \nstructures needed to build  the project. There are also no plans to resettle villages, in line with the \nproject’s  commitment  to  reduce  its  impacts on the surrounding area and local communities. \n\nDuring  its  implementation  phase,  the  project  is  investing  around  R$4.23  billion  in  social  and \nenvironmental initiatives, of which R$2.74 billion had been spent by February 2015 (64% of the total \nplanned  amount).  The  management  of  social  and  environmental  aspects  is  guided  by  the  Basic \nEnvironmental  Plan,  which  is  being  implemented  through  117  programs,  plans  and  projects, \nencompassing  social, \ninvestments,  aimed  at \ncompensating  for  and  mitigating  the  potential  impacts  identified  in  the  environmental  viability \nstudies.  \n\nland-related  and  physical-biotic \n\nindigenous, \n\nSocial investments in local municipalities and indigenous communities represent around 60% of the \nbudget, covering social, cultural, economic and infrastructure aspects. \n\nThey include initiatives to  monitor and  improve health, education, training,  income generation and \nappreciation  of  cultural  and  intangible  heritage.  Of  these  investments,  108  projects  have  been \ncompleted  to  build  or  renovate  schools,  basic  health  centers  and  hospitals  (in  rural  and  urban \nareas), and by the end of the project there should be 136 new facilities. In programs for indigenous \npeople, more than R$226.3 million of the planned R$358.7 million has already been invested. \n\nAs part of social and environmental requirements related to the creation of Belo  Monte’s  reservoir,  \nwork  is  under  way  to  comply  with  the  National  Solid  Waste  Plan,  which  has  involved  remediating \nexisting dumps, completed in October 2012, and implementing sanitary landfills, in operation since \nearly  2013,  for  the  municipalities  of  Altamira  and  Vitória  do  Xingu,  benefiting  a  population  of \napproximately 120,000 people.  \n\nAlso  in  2013,  work  began  on  building  these  municipalities’   entire   water   and   sewage  systems, \ninvolving  investments  of  around  R$500  million  and  completed  in  late  2014,  significantly  improving \nthe way urban waste is disposed of in the region, where conditions used to be much worse than in \nBrazil as a whole. \n\nAs  the  reservoir  is  formed,  the  urban  population  living  in  areas  of  “palafitas”  (houses  on  stilts)  in  the  \ncity  of  Altamira  is  being  resettled  in  new  neighborhoods.  In  all,  4,100  houses  have  been  built  in \nareas equipped with comprehensive basic and leisure infrastructure to improve  the  people’s  quality  \nof life. \n\nThe  implementation  of  the  Basic  Environmental  Plan  also  involves  actions  for  the  physical-biotic \nenvironment,  including  research,  monitoring  and  environmental  conservation  activities.

Vale  is also responsible for polluting the sea  and modifying  its biodiversity  due to iron ore \nsedimentation  in  the sea  in the region of  Camburi,  in Vitória. It is  also  possible  to observe similar \nsituations  in  São Luís, Maranhão,  where fishermen are affected by  the  Port  of Ponta  da  Madeira, \nand in Malaysia, where the Teluk Rubiah Maritime Terminal was opened by Vale in 2014. \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nIn  São  Luís,  Maranhão,  Vale  monitors  the  area  around  the  piers  of  Ponta  da  Madeira  Maritime \nTerminal, located in São Marcos Bay. This work is done in partnership with the Federal University of \nMaranhão  (UFMA),  through  its  Oceanography  Department,  and  consists  of  evaluating  the  marine \necosystem of waters in the area around Vale’s  port  operations. The results indicate that there is no \nevidence of alterations to the marine environment composed of fauna and flora organisms. A team \nof  researchers  in  different  fields,  including  bioscience,  oceanography,  zoology  and  geochemistry, \nuses modern equipment to measure water and sediment quality parameters. \n\nTKCSA clarifies that the decline in fishing in Sepetiba Bay has been occurring since the 1970s for \nnumerous reasons that are not influenced by the company, which began its construction activities in \n2005  and  started  up  in  June  2010.  All  the  compensatory  measures  for  fishing,  as  established  by \nINEA, have been met by the company. \n\nIn  Vitória,  Vale  produced  and  officially  submitted  the  complementary  studies  requested  by  the \nenvironmental  authorities  following  an  analysis  of  work  presented  in  July  2013.

It should be \nnoted that the material in  question,  deposited during the  1970s,  is confined  to the far north of the \nbeach and has not caused any impacts on the rest of the shore. It is also important to emphasize \nthat  since  the  1980s  the  company  has  used  control  measures  to  impede  this  kind  of  occurrence, \nand has been conducting marine monitoring of the bay for 26 years. \n\nSechura   Bay   (Bahía   de   Sechura)   in   Peru,   located   near   Miski   Mayo   mining   company   (Vale’s  \nsubsidiary) is constantly monitored by OEFA, the Peruvian environmental inspection agency. OEFA \nensures   that   the   particulate  material   from   phosphate   rock   released   in   the   mining   company’s   truck  \nboarding area is within the limits established by law. Other renowned institutes in the country, such \nas the Technological Institute of Production (Instituto Tecnológico de la Producción  – ITP) and the \nPeruvian  Sea  Institute  (Instituto  del  Mar  del  Perú  –  IMARPE),  state  that  the  Sechura  Bay \ncontaminant factors are not related to the mining activity. Additionally, we report that the phosphate \nis transported in fully covered conveyor belts, which prevent contact of the product with the air. This \nmeasure is part of the continuous improvement action plan put in place by Miski Mayo in 2011. The \ncompany  reinforces  its  commitment  to  the  environmental  preservation  of  the  regions  where  it \noperates. In 2012 it urged authorities and other companies in the Piura region to join efforts towards \nproper sanitation in the Sechura Bay in Peru. As a result, in 2014 a Supreme Resolution (nº 288-\n2014-PCM) was issued and a number of meetings and participatory monitoring activities under this \ninitiative took place. As for the previous consultation in San Martin de Sechura; the process is not \ncarried out by the investment project lead, but by the relevant governmental body which, in the case \nof the mining sector in Peru, is the Ministry of Energy and Mines. In order to approve inception of \nMiski Mayo operations, the Ministry established that there was no need for a previous consultation, \ngiven that San Martín de Sechura Community is not an indigenous population. In addition to that, at \nthat particular moment, previous consultation processes had not been regulated by local legislation \n(which  entered  into  force  in  2011).  The  Vice  ministry  of  Intercultural  Affairs  within  the  Ministry  of \nCulture,  which  is  the  body  in  charge  of  recognizing  Indigenous  populations  in  Peru,  does  not \nacknowledge  the  presence  of  Indigenous  populations  in  the  Piura  department,  where  the  San \nMartín de Sechura community  is located. Even so, the company established a  lasting relationship \nwith neighborhood communities, providing them with information on the enterprise, clarifying doubts \nand  supporting  the  community  grievance  process,  which  is  fundamental  for  proper  social  impact \nmanagement.  \n\n22)  Piquiá de baixo, Açailândia, Maranhão \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “A luta pelo território em Piquiá de Baixo.

By trying to challenge the process of recognizing \nthe  quilombola  lands,  Vale  once  more  demonstrates  its  modus  operandi  to  enable  its  projects  by \ndepriving social groups of free enjoyment of the different social, economic, environmental, cultural \nand  historical  possibilities  of  their  territories.  In  September  2014,  the  EFC  was  occupied  by  rural \nworkers  from  35  quilombola  communities  in  Maranhão,  who  demanded  a  series  of  measures  to \nguarantee  their  territorial  rights.

Following this protest, some members of these communities \nhave been sued in the courts or investigated in Federal Police inquiries established at  Vale S.A.’s  \nrequest.” \n\nVale’s  Response  \n\nDuring the land titling process for the quilombola communities of Monge Belo and Santa Rosa dos \nPretos, a cartographic error was  observed in the public notices published by  INCRA in the  official \ngazette  (DOU).  As  well  as  featuring  the  wrong  coordinates,  the  polygons  presented  in  the  public \nnotice overlapped the area  allocated to the right-of-way strip for the  EFC’s  operation.  Considering  \nthese  facts   and   with   the   safety   of   people   and   the   operation’s   maintenance   in   mind,   Vale  made  a \nrequest for the respective administrative corrections to be made as part of the land titling process \nfor these territories. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

These  commitments  include  the  construction  of  four  railroad  bridges,  one  of  which  was \ndelivered  in  June  2015.  Construction  work  on  the  second  bridge  began  in  March  2015  and  we \nexpect it  will be completed in February  2016. Accordingly,  we  will meet the schedule stipulated in \nthe court settlement, which provides for the construction of two more bridges, in 2017 and 2018. \n\nSince the agreement was signed, relations with the communities have progressed with no conflicts. \n\nOn  July  10,  2014,  the  president  of  the  National  Institute  for  Colonization  and  Agricultural  Reform \n(INCRA)  published  INCRA  Ordinance  355,  recognizing  and  declaring  the  lands  of  the  remaining \nquilombo community of Santa Rosa dos Pretos. \n\nAs part of the licensing process, the Palmares Cultural Foundation – the federal government body \nresponsible for the quilombola component in environmental licensing processes  – determined that \nthere  are  15  communities  in  the  Carajás  Railroad’s   area   of   direct   influence.  Of  these  15 \ncommunities,  nine  are  proceeding  with  the  process  of  implementing  initiatives  to  mitigate  and/or \ncompensate for impacts arising  from  the  EFC’s  operation  and  expansion  work, as specified in the \nBasic  Environmental  Plan,  which  was  validated  following  public  consultations.  These  initiatives \ninclude  sub-programs  to  strengthen  quilombola  culture,  to  support  communication,  to  promote \nsafety and to prevent people and animals from being hit by trains. Vale is waiting for approval from \nthe other six communities, where the corresponding initiatives have been suspended at the request \nof the Federal  Public  Defender’s  Office while the Palmares Cultural Foundation clarifies a number of \nmatters to this entity. \n\nVale remains in dialogue with all the communities and has made a request for approval from the six \ncommunities so that it can execute the initiatives provided for in the Basic Environmental Plan. \n\n26) \n\nThe  Vale  Foundation’s  Education Initiatives \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Através da Fundação Vale, a Vale S.A. investe em inúmeros projetos \nligados  à  educação  infantil  e  de  jovens  e  adultos,  tanto  dos  seus  trabalhadores,  quanto  nas \ncomunidades  próximas  aos  seus  empreendimentos.

These   projects   are   part   of   the   company’s   strategy   to   seek   legitimacy,  both  among \nsociety  and  in  the  markets.  Mining  is  a  sector  recognized  for  its  major  social  and  environmental \nimpacts.  As  a  result,  programs  linked  to  the  social  responsibility  of  companies  are  designed  to \nminimize  the  effects  inherent  to  mining  activity.  However,   in   Vale’s   projects   one   may   note   the  \ndevelopment of palliative  measures  that  take  advantage  of  the  state’s  omissions in the localities in \nquestion. In other words, Vale claims for itself a role that belongs to the state. The Vale Foundation \nfunctions  through  public-private  social  partnerships,  which  as  the  company  itself  describes,  are \npacts  between  government,  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  to  promote  regional  development, \nenabling  the  company  to  benefit  from  tax  incentives.  What  is  not  evident  is  how  its  social \nresponsibility  activities  interfere  with  decision-making  processes  within  the  public  authorities.  A \ngood  example  of  this  is  Vale’s   partnerships   with   Municipal   Education   Secretariats  to  offer \nprofessional  development  courses  for  teachers,  directors  and  supervisors  at  schools  looking  for \ncontinuing professional training. These courses, organized and conducted by the Vale Foundation, \nare  an  important  instrument  to   deploy   the   company’s   ideology  in  society,  making  its  vision \nhegemonic  and  directly  affecting  the  formation  of  social  subjectivity.  Besides  contributing  to  the \nconstruction  of  a  very  positive  image  for  the  company,  investment  in  sectors  such  as  education, \nhealth,  culture  and  the  environment  offer  various  possibilities  to  expose  facts  and  figures  that  are \nnot strictly financial about Vale, and serve to generate social value for the company, influencing its \nmarket value and role.

Além \ndisso,  essa  parceria  compromete  a  autonomia  científica  no  estudo  das  relações  entre  meio \nambiente e sociedade no Brasil, principalmente no que se refere ao setor da mineração.” \n\nEnglish version: “Vale  Capes Awards. An example of this kind of investment by the company was \nthe  launch  of  the  Vale-Capes  Science  and  Sustainability  Awards,  created  through  a  partnership \nbetween the Brazilian Education Ministry’s  graduate  education  support  agency (Capes) and Vale. \n\nEstablished  during  the  Rio  +20  Conference,  this  scheme  distributes  prizes  for  PhD  and  MA \ndissertations associated with environmental and social topics. Vale’s  partnership  with  one  of  Brazil’s  \nleading public institutions in the field of knowledge production is a way for the company to validate \nits image as an important promoter of new technologies and practices for sustainable development, \ncloaking  its  action  as  one  of  the  main  players  responsible  for  serious  social  and  environmental \nconflicts, both in Brazil and other countries. Furthermore, this partnership harms scientific autonomy \nin the study of relations between the environment and society in Brazil, especially with regard to the \nmining sector.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nSince 2009, when it created its Technology and Innovation Department, Vale has been establishing \ndistinctive ways of interacting with the science and technology community. This movement is based \non   the   company’s   perception  that  its  frontiers  need  to  be  expanded  to  permit  broader  and  more \nstructured  dialogue  with  other  players.  By  expanding  its  frontiers  and  developing  closer \nrelationships with academic institutions, the company shows that it values institutional coordination \nand  the  pursuit  of  complementary  interests  and  ways  of  working.  This  stance  is  aligned  with  the \nprinciple of open innovation, through which divergent views give way to cooperation and institutional \ncoordination.  \n\nIn  line  with  this  model,  Vale  has  developed  several  initiatives  together  with  the  academic \ncommunity,  including  the  launches  of  public  contests  in  partnership  with  government  entities  to \npromote  scientific  knowledge.  These  initiatives  include  the  Vale-Capes  Science  and  Sustainability \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The initiative \nwas implemented through a national public contest, in which any student who completed an MA or \nPhD  course  in  2001,  at  any  Brazilian  university,  could  take  part.  In  its  latest  edition  (2014),  127 \npapers  were  submitted  from  all  over  Brazil  (90  MA  and  37  PhD  dissertations),  up  from  110  the \nprevious year. The award-winning papers included studies about the use of solar energy and social \ntechnologies  to  combat  poverty,  both  from  states  that  do  not  have  Vale  operations.  Given  the \ninitiative’s  success, Capes will not only maintain the awards in the coming years, but also proposes \nto hold a seminar regarding the winning entries for the next edition. \n\nVale  believes  that  a  modern  and  developed  society  is  the  result  of  dialogue,  in  which  differences \nare  viewed  as  opportunities  and  solutions  are  constructed  through  institutional  cooperation. \nAccordingly, university-company relationships are an ideal solution. \n\n29) \n\nCOMEFC \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Em 2013, no Maranhão, 23 prefeituras decidiram se reunir para criar o \nConsórcio dos Municípios da Estrada de Ferro Carajás (Comefc).

Vale’s  activities  have  made  a \nsignificant contribution to GDP, allowing mining regions to improve their HDI over the last 70 years \nin  the  State  of  Minas  Gerais  and  over  the  last  30  years  in  the  North  of  Brazil.  There  is  no \nquestioning  that  mining  activities  in  Brazil  have  had  a  positive  impact  at  the  national  and  local \nlevels. Numerous studies conducted by different specialists offer evidence to this end. One of them \nwas conducted by Oxford Policy Management, ICMM and IBRAM and can be accessed  on  ICMM’s  \nwebsite:  http://www.icmm.com/document/5423.

That  said,  it  is  important  to \nclarify that the  allegation  that  Vale’s  activities  have  had  negative impacts in Brazil, Mozambique are \nbased  on  two  reports  that  have  partial  and  misleading  information:  the  2012  Public  Eye  and  the \n2015 Unsustainability Report. \n\nWe worked on the clarification and rectification  of the main allegations made against  Vale  in  both \nReports.

All  these  steps  had  the \nparticipation  of \nintense  process  engagement  and \nconsultation,  offering  access  to  information  about  the  enterprise  before  the  implementation  had \nbegun,  discussing  their  worries  and  demands  and  working  on  short  and  long  term  mitigation \nprograms  \n\nindigenous  communities,  reflecting  an \n\nimpact  matrices \n\nanthropological \n\ncommunities, \n\ndiagnoses, \n\nand \n\nVale  acted  in  line  with  legal  provisions,  holding  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special \nconcern  for  technical  studies  regarding  indigenous  peoples  and  quilombola  communities,  and \nextensive  dialogue  with  them.  Communication  with  communities  near  the  railroad  is  permanent. \nPublic meetings were held with the affected communities on July 9, 10, 12 and 13, 2012, in addition \nto  meetings  dedicated  exclusively  to  quilombola  and  indigenous  communities.  These  public \nmeetings and hearings complied with the terms of CONAMA Resolution 09/86, which provides for \nprocedures for public participation within the scope of environmental licensing.  \n\nDue  to  the  regularity  of  the  studies  and  the  entire  public  consultation  process,  Vale  obtained  the \nrespective environmental licenses to install the project, and obtained approval from FUNAI and the \nPalmares Foundation to expand the railroad.  \n\nConcerning  the  Free,  Prior,  and  Informed  Consent  procedure  for  indigenous  and  traditional \npopulations, although Brazil abides by ILO Convention 169, through Legislative  Decree 143/2002, \nthe regulations stipulating procedures and the scope of rules is still under discussions.. Regardless \nof  this,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialogue  established  between  Vale  and  the  traditional \ncommunities  along  the  EFC,  as  well  as  the  provision  of  all  necessary  information  related  to  the \nproject  previous  of  its  implementation  to  these  communities,  in-person,  and  the  consultation  on \nwhich  and  how  the  mitigations  plans  should  be  developed  and  implemented  meet  the  essential \nobjective of ILO Convention 169. \n\nThe regularity of the environmental licensing process was reaffirmed in a court ruling of the Federal \nRegional Court (TRF), which recognized that the measures taken by Vale are in full compliance with \nthe requirements of the competent technical and environmental authorities. Note that the work does \nnot  involve  building  a  new  railroad  or  double-tracking  the  entire  length  of  the  existing  one,  but \nmerely  connecting  existing  railroad  yards  along  the  original  track,  which  will  generate  benefits  for \ngeneral  cargo  and  passenger  transportation,  besides  the  iron  ore.  Accordingly,  Vale  has  been \ninvesting  heavily  in  local  manpower  training  and  social  and  environmental  programs  to  boost  the \nlocal development of the region and its population. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Em  seu \npercurso da mina ao porto, os trens da Vale atravessam mais de cem comunidades tradicionais e \nindígenas, dentre outros grupos sociais.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “Train  hopping  children.  There  is  no  mining  without  disaster.  In  Pará  and \nMaranhão,  boys  and  girls,  mostly  from  the  municipalities  of  Marabá  and  Parauapebas,  risk  their \nlives  by  traveling  clandestinely   on   Vale’s   freight   or   passenger   trains.  In  search  of  a  better  life  or \nescaping from their families, they try to reach São Luís in a state of extreme vulnerability, danger to \ntheir lives and utter lack of dignity. These children and teenagers hide among the iron ore, with only \ntheir  heads  appearing,  or  using  the  upper  part  of  a  soft  drink  bottle  as  a  funnel  through  which  to \nbreathe. Climbing into the iron ore railcars while the train is moving is extremely dangerous, leading \nin many cases to injury or mutilation. Cases of physical violence and threats against the children by \nVale’s   security   guards   have   also   been   reported.  Operating  for  three  decades  in  the  region,  Vale \ndoes not admit that this is an impact caused by mining and claims it is a consequence of existing \nsocioeconomic  problems.  In  their  journey  from  mine  to  port,  Vale’s   trains   cross   more   than   100  \ntraditional and indigenous communities, among other social groups.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nThe  phenomenon  known  as  the  “train  hopping  children”  consists  of  the  practice  of  children  and \nteenagers  covertly  entering  the  railcars  of  the  Carajás  Railroad  (EFC),  on  journeys  from \nParauapebas in Pará to São Luis in Maranhão, or vice versa. \n\nThe  EFC  extends  for  892  km  and  crosses  27  municipalities  (four  in  Pará  and  23  in  Maranhão), \npassing around 100 communities.  \n\nThe  Maranhão  State  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  filed  a  public  civil  lawsuit  in  2011,  and  in  the \nfollowing year a partial agreement was made to produce a Safety Plan to be implemented following \nanalysis and discussion between the parties. \n\nOn  March  16,  2012,  the  Maranhão  State  Public  Prosecution  Ministry,  together  with  several  public \nauthorities, deputies, representatives of public defender offices, the Pará State Public Prosecution \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

In  the  case  of  railroad  crossings,  Vale \nconducts  periodic  inspections  to  regularize  or  remove  illegal  crossings.  To  regularize  them,  the \ncompany counts the number of vehicles that use them in order to identify the need for signage and \ncrossing adjustments, or to install a road bridge. \n\nOfficial  railroad  crossings  are  those  that  have  been  approved  and  recognized  by  Vale,  and  they \nreceive proper signage and maintenance. The Carajás Railroad has 126 official railroad crossings \nalong its 892-km length, with an average distance between crossings of around 7 km.  \n\nAccording  to  the  National  Association  of  Railroad  Transportation  Companies  (ANTF),  the  EFC  is \nnow  considered   one   of   Brazil’s   leading   railroads,  not  only  due  to  its  freight  volumes,  but  also \nbecause it uses cutting-edge technology in its operations, making it highly productive, efficient and \nsafe.  To  guarantee  maximum  operational  safety  and  high  productivity  for  its  customers,  the  EFC \ncontinuously  invests  in  maintaining  and  expanding  its  assets,  including  by  acquiring  locomotives \nand specialist railcars to transport a variety of goods. \n\nDespite presenting continual improvements in the internationally adopted indicator of accidents per \nmillion  train-km  (mTKm),  which  takes  into  account  accidents  in  line  with  the  number  of  trains  and \ndistance  travelled,  we  know  we  still  need  to  do  more.  We  run  a  series  of  initiatives  to  mitigate \nimpacts and have teams dedicated to managing, monitoring, tracking and responding to incidents. \n\nOur mitigation initiatives include educational and awareness-raising campaigns in communities near \nthe  railroad,  modernization  and  expansion  of  signaling  systems,  the  identification  of  critical \nstretches  in  terms  of  environmental  risks,  weather  monitoring,  and  expansion  of  the  number  of \nsimulators and train operation training courses.

This  study  was  carried  out  by  UFES  under  the  technical \ncoordination of IEMA, and was completed in 2011. Material was collected between April 2009 and \nJanuary  2011  at  nine  monitoring  stations  in  Greater  Vitória.  As  a  result,  it  was  seen  that  the \natmospheric  quality  standards  defined  by  the  National  Environment  Council  are  being  complied \nwith, and that the contribution of industries is only predominant at the Senac Hotel station, on Boi \nIsland.  At  the  Enseada  do  Suá  and  Carapina  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  of  the  same \nmagnitude as the contribution  called  “human  activities” (re-suspension of soils and streets, vehicles \nand  burned  objects).  At  the  other  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  not  predominant,  with  a \nshare varying from 10% to 25% of total contributions.  \n\nThe  available  study,  however,  did  not  consider  the  environmental  improvements  implemented  at \nTubarão  Complex  in  recent  years,  as  it  was  completed  before  the  measures  provided  for  in  the \nEnvironmental Commitment Agreement were taken. As a result, for Vale it is essential to carry out \nnew  studies  to  update  and  expand  the  data,  to  determine  the  share  of  different  sources  in  the \ncomposition  of  the  “black  dust”  in  each  region  of  Greater  Vitória and enable strategic management \nof  the  region’s  air  quality.  \n\nThe  company  is  participating  in  new  studies  in  partnership  with  the  State  Public  Prosecution \nMinistry and the State Environment and Water Resources Institute. \n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the company invested R$700 million in environmental controls. As a result \nof  these  investments,  Vale’s  entire  production  system  at  Tubarão Complex, from the arrival of iron \nore  until  its  loading  onto  ships,  is  equipped  with  the  most  modern  environmental  control \ntechnologies.  \n\nThis investment includes the following: the installation of wind fences, pioneering structures in Brazil \nthat reduce the wind speed around piles of iron ore and pellets, cutting the amount of dust carried \ninto the air by 77%; the application of dust polymers and suppressants, products that prevent dust \nemissions  in  piles  of  iron  ore  and  pellets;  the  use  of  new  longer  chutes  on  ship  loaders  to  direct \nproducts  into  vessel  holds;  the  enclosure  of  areas  where  products  are  transferred  from  one \nconveyor belt to another; and the operation of 25 electrostatic precipitators, equipment that is 99% \nefficient in controlling emissions in smokestacks. \n\nTubarão  Complex  also  has  an  Environmental  Control  Center,  which  uses  a  CCTV  system \ncomposed  of  22  continuously  operating  cameras  to  monitor  Vale’s   operations,  in  order  to \npreventively  guarantee  the  effectiveness  of  environmental  controls.  This  enables  immediate \ndecision making, with agility and efficiency, in the event of operational deviations. \n\nVale reiterates its commitment to the environment and the communities of Greater Vitória. \n\nVale  is  fully  willing  to  collaborate  with  the  Parliamentary  Commission  of  Inquiry  about  black  dust \ninstigated by the Legislative Assembly of Espírito Santo in order to investigate particulate emissions \nand their effect on the health of Greater  Vitória’s  people, and it reiterates that it is always open to \ndialogue with society. \n\n8)  Death of two workers in Sudbury, Canada \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The  dispersion  of \nparticulate matter in the air and water at the moment when the phosphate is loaded onto ships for \nexport  is  causing  severe  respiratory  problems  among  people  who  live  near  the  port,  and \nimbalances in the marine system, affecting the health and livelihood of local fishermen.  \n\nIn 2011, a complaint was made against the company by members of the PetroPeru workers’  union, \nwho  work  at  a  terminal  300  meters   from   Vale’s   vessels.  This  complaint  resulted  in  the  company \nbeing  fined  in  2013  by  Peru’s   Environmental   Evaluation   and   Inspection   Agency   (Oefa).  In \nDecember  2014,  Vale  was  reported  to  the  United  Nations  rapporteur  in  Cumbre  de  Los  Pueblos, \nLima.  A  representative  of  the  San  Martín  de  Sechura  Community  Defense  Front,  Augusto \nChapilliquen, alleged that ‘the mineral deposits are on community land  privatized in 2005 by Vale, \nwhich began exploration in 2010, without prior consultation, in breach of ILO Convention 169.’ \n\n“In  Sechura  Bay  in  Peru,  eutrophication  –  a  process  that  provokes  excessive  growth  of  biomass \nand  the  impoverishment  of  diversity  due  to  an  increase  in  nutrients  in  an  ecosystem  –  caused  by \nthe loading of phosphate powder directly affects the livelihoods of a large share of the local people \nwho make a living from fishing.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nSechura Bay in Peru, located near Vale subsidiary Mineradora Miski Mayo, is constantly monitored \nby  Peru’s  environmental  inspector,  OEFA,  which  has  found  that  the  particulate  matter  arising  from  \nthe   loading   of   phosphate   rock   in   the   mining   company’s   truck   loading  area  is  below  the  limits \npermitted by law. \n\nOther  competent  institutes  in  the  country,  such  as  the  Production  Technology  Institute  (ITP)  and \nPeruvian Sea Institute (IMARPE), have stated that the factors that are contaminating Sechura Bay \nare not related to mining activity. \n\nIn addition, the phosphate transportation process takes place using conveyor belts in a completely \nenclosed  structure,  which  prevents  contact  between  the  product  and  the  air.

Around 50 employees are the \nchildren  of  the  local  fishermen  communities  of  Pulau  Pangkor  and  Manjung  and  have  joined  the \ncompany as junior apprentices.   \n\nIn addition, only in the construction phase more than 60% of the total investments were channeled \nto local suppliers, generating a positive socio-economic spillover effect in the region.  \n\nVale has also invested in the preservation of the natural environment in Teluk Rubiah. About 60% \nof the area owned by Vale is maintained by the company as a protected forest area, known as the \nTeluk  Rubiah  forest.

Based  on the findings of this research  and  analysis  of national and international human \nrights  safeguards,  we  identified  practical  recommendations  of  greatest  relevance  to  potential \nresettlement  resulting  from  various  development  projects  that  may  occur  in  Mozambique  in  the \ncoming years. \n\nThe  fact  that  Human  Rights  Watch  based  its  research  on  concrete  data  and  its  problem-solving \nattitude made this engagement process a rich learning experience for Vale and highly beneficial for \nthe resettled families. \n\nIn its report, Human Rights Watch recognized  Vale’s  efforts  to solve the problems presented by the \nresettled people and stressed that Vale and the government of Mozambique signed a memorandum \nof understanding, and almost all of the actions in this agreement have now been implemented.  \n\nVale in Mozambique has been working continuously to improve the new settlements and is striving \nto take measures to support these families, together with the spheres of government and based on \ndialogue with these communities.  \n\nThe process of producing the Resettlement Action Plan involved extensive engagement and public \nparticipation, consisting of three public hearings, 20 theater performances in the predominant local \nlanguage  (Nyungwe),  110  meetings  with  the  community  and  its  leaders  using  tools  such  as \nillustrated materials, 4,927 home visits to families and leaders for mobilization and social assistance \npurposes, and 639 social consultations until the start of resettlement. \n\nAs  part  of  the  process  of  implementing  the  Moatize  Coal  project,  the  following  infrastructure  was \nbuilt  or  renovated  for  the  community  in  the  Cateme  and  25  de  Setembro  areas:  an  elementary \nschool,  library,  teachers’   houses,   school   principal’s  house,  high  school,  information  technology \nroom, laboratory, health and maternity center, police station, streets, and electric power facilities. \n\nIn the neighborhood of Cateme, for example, Vale built two schools within the scope of the national \neducation system. One of them is Cateme Elementary School, which can accommodate up to 1,200 \nstudents,  with  18  classrooms  and  a  library.  Cateme  High  School,  in  turn,  is  designed  for  up  to \naround  650  students  and  has  12  classrooms,  a  library,  accommodation  for  270  students,  and  an \ninformation technology room. \n\nOn July 6, 2012, Vale and the central government signed a memorandum of understanding in order \nto  establish  coordinated  actions  between  the  public  sphere,  the  company  and  community \nrepresentatives  to  maintain  the  existing  infrastructure  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the \ncommunities of Cateme and 25 de Setembro. \n\nThe  following  actions  have  been  carried  out:  maintenance  of  public  drains  and  streets, \nimprovements  to  the  water  supply  system,  expansion  of  the  power  grid,  construction  of  sports \nfacility,  investments  in  agriculture,  development  of  solutions  to  support  public  transport,  and \ninvestments in health, such as the delivery of the 25 de Setembro Health Center and donation of an \nambulance.  \n\nActions  are  being  developed  to  establish  alternative  income  generation  sources,  such  as  the \nfollowing: \n\n  Production  and  sale  of  chickens  to  increase   families’   income.

This  program \nbenefited 57 families, by acquiring 2,892 fruit trees (including mango, guava and lemon). \n\n  Development of poultry and horticulture value chain in Cateme, through the installation of a \n\nslaughterhouse and vegetable packing house.  \n\n  Holding  of  vocational  training  courses  on  electricity,  IT  and  construction  for  150  young \n\npeople in Cateme.  \n\nIn  order  to  reinforce  community  dialogue  and  engagement,  and  promote  civic  and  citizenship \nactivities,  Vale  has set up  a number of  community centers. Among  other purposes, these centers \nare  designed  to  share  information,  interests  and  expectations,  build  mutual  trust,  improve \nknowledge of local reality and support the community in finding solutions to demands raised during \nmeetings between the company and residents. The community centers involve the collaboration of \ncommunity  agents,  who  are  members  of  the  community  hired  by  Vale  to  facilitate  community \ndialogue.  \n\nThe actions conducted by Vale in region include the following: \n\n \n\nImplementation of a community radio station: In partnership with the Social Communication \nInstitute,  Vale  has  established  a  community  radio  station  in  Cateme  to  produce  programs \naimed at community development. \n\n  Health: Construction of “Mothers’  Waiting  House,” a building designed to receive pregnant \nwomen  awaiting  birth.  The  Cateme  Health  Center,  which   includes   the   Mothers’   Waiting  \nHouse, serves communities located within a 20-km radius. \n\n  Road  building:  As  a  way  of  supporting  the  communities  and  improving  Cateme’s  \n\naccessibility, Vale built an 8-km paved road, including two bridges. \n\n  Expansion of power grid: In response to community requests, Vale funded the expansion of \n\nthe power grid, to cover all the new neighborhoods of Cateme. \n\n \n\nIncrease  in  water  storage  capacity:  Vale  has  built  two  dams  in  Cateme,  raising  the  water \nstorage  capacity  to  supply  crops  and  livestock.  It  has  also  distributed  drums  to  facilitate \nwater transportation, reducing the amount of time spent on this activity.  \n\n  Promotion  of  livestock  farming:  Vale  donated  150  cattle  to  50  families.  Each  family \nreceived three  animals  (two  oxen  to  be  used  as  draft  animals  and  one  cow  for \nreproduction).  The  company  also  donated  25  Brahman  bulls  to  improve  the  genetics  of \nlocal cattle. \n\n  Training  on  rural  finance:  Around  800  families  have  done  training  on  savings  and  credit, \nleadership,  management  and  business  development,  and  how  to  establish  and  run \nassociations. This training culminated in the formation of eight associations and two unions \nin  the  community  of  Cateme.

A  study  carried  out  by  the  Mozambican  Social  and \nEconomic  Study  Institute  (Iese)  warned  that  Moatize  may  suffer  serious  atmospheric  pollution \nproblems due to its coal mines, and found that the presence in the air of pollutants such as sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide  may  be  harmful  to  the  population’s  long-term health.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nWith regard to air quality, we have a real-time monitoring network with stations located inside and \noutside the concession area, measuring emissions levels. To gauge possible emissions arising from \nthe concession area, in April 2015 we set up a station within the community (in the boundary with \nthe concession area). We follow air quality legal standards. We monitor SO2, NO2, O3, PTS, PM10 \nand PM2.5. These parameters record concentrations below the standards at our monitoring station \nlocated  between  the  mining  concession  and  the  community,  indicating  a  low  impact  of  mining \nactivity. On the other hand, the monitoring station located inside the town of Moatize presents high \nlevels of particulate matter, indicating the influence of other activities on these concentrations. The \nconcentrations recorded so far at the station in the boundary of the community and the concession \narea may be associated with the effectiveness of the environmental particulate control measures in \nplace at the mine, namely fixed sprinkler systems in the stockyard, mist cannons at the run of mine \n(ROM)  pad,  sprinkling  of  temporary  access  roads,  and  the  application  of  a  bitumen-based \nbiodegradable   emulsion   called   “Dust-a-Side”   on   permanent   access   roads   to   reduce   particulate  \nmatter emissions. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Contudo,  a  Vale  não  se  responsabiliza  pelos \nacidentes e nem pelas sete mortes ocorridas. Negando, deste modo, sua própria negligência e os \nimpactos  da  intensificação  da  extração  mineral  na  saúde  do  trabalhador.  Para  piorar,  a  empresa \ncostuma culpabilizar as vítimas. \n\nNo processo de intensificação da jornada de trabalho, a Vale conseguiu anular a jornada de turno \nrodízio de seis horas. Este turno garante, minimamente, que, diante de um trabalho desgastante, \ndecorrente  do  revezamento  da  jornada  entre  os  períodos  diurno  e  noturno,  além  de  perigoso  e \ninsalubre  como  o  da  mineração,  os  trabalhadores  consigam  algum  tipo  de  bem-estar  e  tenham \ntempo  livre  fora  das  minas.  O  aumento  da  jornada  de  trabalho  para  oito  horas  resulta  em  mais \nacidentes,  mais  afastamentos  por  problemas  de  saúde  e  no  aumento  de  uma  doença  que  vem \nassolando os trabalhadores mineiros: a depressão.” \n\nEnglish version: “In  Canada,  Minas  Gerais  and  Parauapebas,   labor unions  denounce the under-\nreporting of work accidents, increase in length of working days, high amount of overtime demanded, \nincrease in pressure and  harassment within the company, co-opting of unions, and persecution of \nunion leaders. \n\nIts  2013  Sustainability  Report  mentions  some  accidents  that  occurred  within  its  operational  sites. \nHowever,  Vale  does  not  take  responsibility  for  these  accidents,  nor  for  the  seven  deaths  that \noccurred.  In  this  way,  it  denies  its  own  negligence  and  the  impacts  of  intensification  of  mineral \nextraction  on  workers’  health. To make things worse, the company continues to blame victims. \n\nAs part  of the  working  day intensification  process, Vale has managed to end the six-hour rotating \nshift working day. This system ensures that, given the stress involved in taking turns doing day and \nnight  shifts,  as  well  as  the  dangerous  and  unhealthy  nature  of mining  work,  workers  obtain  some \nkind of wellbeing and have free time away from the mines. The increased length of working days to \neight hours is resulting in more accidents, more leave due to health problems, and growing cases of \na disease that has been ravaging mining workers: depression. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

O  sindicato \nMetabase Inconfidentes, em Minas Gerais, por exemplo, acusa a Vale de engessar as ações dos \nsindicatos e criar empecilhos às tentativas de garantir melhores condições de vida e trabalho. Um \ndos mais recentes casos foi a perseguição a dirigentes, que culminou com a demissão do diretor \nsindical  Vander  Luis  Ferreira,  em  junho  de  2014,  sem  qualquer  justificativa  razoável.  Na  época, \nestavam  ocorrendo  várias  manifestações  de  trabalhadores  e  da  população  em  geral  que \nreivindicavam  condições  básicas  de  trabalho,  segurança,  saúde  e  transporte  nas  localidades  em \nque a Vale e outras mineradoras atuam. O diretor foi penalizado por ter ousado criticar a empresa \ndiante da imprensa. Este tem sido o padrão histórico de atuação da Vale, tanto no Brasil como no \nexterior. Em 2008, o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Indústrias Petroquímicas (Sindiquímica),  do \nParaná[8],  encaminhou  uma  queixa  sobre  as  práticas  antissindicais  da  Vale  para  a  Organização  \nInternacional do Trabalho (OIT). \n\nNa   operação   em   Voisey’s   Bay,   Labrador,   Canadá,   a   relação   entre   a   Vale   e   o   sindicato   não   foi  \ntotalmente reparado, e o legado da greve de 18 meses (2009-2011) continua.  Há relatos de que, \napós o fim da greve, a Vale continua com as práticas de gestão arbitrária no local de trabalho. A \nVale  continua  a  dificultar  a  vida  dos  trabalhadores  através  da  busca  por  acordos  nos  casos  de \nprocessos  e  arbitragem.  O  estilo  de  gestão  da  empresa  Vale  é  muitas  vezes  interpretado  como \numa  estratégia  para  minar  sutilmente  a  força  dos  sindicatos,  e  isolar  a  liderança  sindical  eleita \ndemocraticamente. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

O  Sindicato  Metabase  Carajás,  no  Pará,  é  o  maior \nsindicato mineiro do país e por se localizar no coração da principal mina da Vale possui um papel \nestratégico  para  a  empresa.  A  prática  de  cooptação  da  Vale  no  sindicato  veio  à  tona  em  2014, \nquando, após 20 anos, um grupo de trabalhadores conseguiu inscrever uma chapa para concorrer \nà  presidência  do  sindicato  sem  ser  derrotada  nos  bastidores.  Durante  essas  duas  décadas,  a \nempresa  e  o  próprio  movimento  sindical  cooptado  alegavam  a  inexistência  de  oposição  entre  os \ntrabalhadores, abafando a permissiva influência da empresa e a insatisfação dos trabalhadores.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “Contrary  to  Vale’s  claims,  workers  and  communities  report  a  non-existence  of \ndialogue,  intimidating  practices  and  a  permanent  policy  of  co-opting  the  labor  movement  and  its \nrepresentatives in order to control criticism. The Metabase Inconfidentes union in Minas Gerais, for \nexample,  accuses  Vale  of  stifling  the  actions  of  unions  and  creating  obstacles  to  attempts  to \nguarantee better living and working conditions. One of the most recent cases was the  persecution \nof leaders, which culminated in the dismissal of union director  Vander Luis Ferreira in June 2014, \nwithout  any  reasonable  grounds.  At  the  time,  various  protests  were  taking  place  among  workers \nand  the  general  public  to  demand  basic  working,  safety,  health  and  transport  conditions  in  the \nlocations  where  Vale  and  other  miners  operate.  The  director  was  penalized  for  having  dared  to \ncriticize the company in the press. This  has  been  Vale’s  standard conduct over time, both in Brazil \nand  abroad.  In  2008,  the  Petrochemical  Industry  Workers  Union  (Sindiquímica)  in  Paraná[8] \nsubmitted   a   complaint   about   Vale’s   anti-union  practices  to  the  International  Labor  Organization \n(ILO). \n\nAt  the  operation  in  Voisey’s Bay, Labrador, Canada, relations between Vale and the union were not \ncompletely repaired, and the legacy of the 18-month strike (2009-2011) remains. There are reports \nthat  following  the  end  of  the  strike,  Vale  continues  to  have  arbitrary  management  practices  in  the \nworkplace. Vale  continues  to  hinder  workers’  lives  by  pursuing  agreements  in  cases of lawsuits and \narbitration. The  company’s  management  style  is  often  interpreted as a strategy to subtly undermine \nunions’  power  and  isolate  democratically  elected union leaders. \n\nDisrespect for free association and co-opting of union. The Carajás Metabase Union in Pará is the \nlargest  mining  union  in  the  country,  and  because  it  is  located  at  the  heart  of  Vale’s  main  mine,  it  has  \na strategic role for the company. Vale’s  practice  of  co-opting the union came to light in 2014, when \nafter  20  years  a  group  of  workers  managed  to  register  a  team  of  candidates  to  compete  for  the \nunion’s  presidency  without  being  defeated  behind  the  scenes. Throughout these two decades, the \ncompany  and  the  co-opted  union  movement  itself  alleged  a  lack  of  opposition  among  workers, \nstifling  the  company’s  permissive  influence  and  workers’  dissatisfaction.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nVale rigorously complies with legislation and respects union freedom and collective bargaining. We \nenter into collective agreements with all the unions that represent our employees and the decisions \nof   workers’   assemblies   are  sovereign  and  fully  respected  by  the  company.

Os impactos desta atividade sobre as águas são extremamente graves, englobando a \ndestruição  de  lençóis  de  água  no  subsolo;  piora  na  qualidade  da  água  no  momento  de  sua \ndevolução, em relação à sua retirada; diminuição da sua disponibilidade; e contaminação de rios, \nmares  e  nascentes  com  rejeitos  químicos,  entre  outros.  Desse  modo,  a  mineração  compromete \nnão  apenas  o  uso,  mas  o  acúmulo  e  a  renovação  das  águas,  provocando  o  fim  das  nascentes. \nAlém  dos  impactos  ambientais,  há  um  aumento  crescente  do  uso  de  grandes  volumes  de  água \ncomo  insumo  gratuito  pelas  grandes  mineradoras,  especialmente  no  que  se  refere  aos \nminerodutos. Em apenas uma hora de funcionamento, eles utilizam água suficiente para abastecer \nao menos uma cidade com 500 mil habitantes no mesmo período de tempo. Em 2012, houve mais \noutorgas para o uso de água na mineração do que para a indústria no Brasil. \n\nNo  Canadá,  o  projeto  de  extração  de  níquel  Voisey’s  Bay, da Vale, é bastante polêmico devido à \ncontaminação  do  Lago  Sandy,  que  possui  um  ecossistema  único.  Utilizado  como  local  para \ndespejo de rejeitos, o lago foi convertido em uma bacia com mais de 400 mil toneladas de dejetos, \nde acordo com denúncias de organizações locais. Além da Vale ser ré na maior Ação Civil Pública \nda história do Canadá por  problemas ambientais, ela  foi condenada,  em 2010, ao pagamento  de \ncerca de C$ 36 milhões (dólares canadenses) em indenização para mais de sete mil moradores de \nPort Colborne, em Ontário.  \n\nEm  Minas  Gerais,  berço  da  criação  da  Vale,  são  inúmeros  os  casos  de  conflitos  entre  o  uso  da \nágua  para  as  operações  da  empresa  e  o  abastecimento  da  população.

A expansão desta \nmina  aconteceu  em  2007,  e  a  cava  foi  realizada  muito  perto  da  comunidade  e  da  fonte  de \nabastecimento do distrito. Os moradores já notam que algumas nascentes estão assoreadas e que \na vazão dos cursos  d’água  diminuiu  consideravelmente,  além  dos problemas decorrentes da poeira \nda  mina  e  da  poluição  do  ar  também  terem  se  agravado  muito.  Mesmo  assim,  a  Vale  planeja \nreabrir  a  mina  Tamanduá,  que  estava  fora  de  atividade  há  cerca  de  quinze  anos.  Esta  mina \nlocaliza-se ainda mais próxima da comunidade do Morro da Água Quente, e perigosamente perto \nda  fonte  de  água  que  abastece  a  sede  do  município  de  Catas  Altas.  Ou  seja,  as  duas  fontes  de \nabastecimento  da  cidade  estão  em  risco  devido  às  operações  da  Vale.  Trata-se  da  segurança \nhídrica de mais de cinco mil pessoas.  \n\nOutro  grave  conflito  de  uso  da  água  pela  Vale  se  encontra  no  modal  de  escoamento  dos \nminerodutos, onde a polpa do minério de ferro é bombeada através da água durante 24 horas por \ndia. A Samarco (empresa em que a Vale detém 50% das ações) opera três minerodutos em Minas \nGerais, que saem da mina Alegria, em Mariana, e vão até o porto do Ubu, em Anchieta, no Espírito \nSanto.  Cada  um  deles  possui  mais  de  400  km  de  extensão.  Os  três  minerodutos  gastam  uma \nmédia de 4.400m³/hora. Depois de décadas destruindo os mananciais dos municípios de Mariana e \nOuro Preto, a empresa precisou captar água para os minerodutos e as usinas da Samarco no Rio \nConceição,  localizado  no  distrito  de  Brumal,  na  cidade  de  Santa  Bárbara.  A  adutora  construída \npara estes fins utiliza 82% do potencial hídrico do rio. Moradores da região informam que na época \nda estiagem o rio termina, literalmente, no ponto de  captação para o duto.  É importante ressaltar \nque, em 2010, um dos minerodutos da Samarco rompeu no município de Espera Feliz, causando \num grave desastre ambiental.” \n\nDestruição da Serra do Gandarela e de seus recursos hídricos \n\nHá  7  anos  o  Movimento  pela  Preservação  da  Serra  do  Gandarela,  do  qual  participam  diversas \norganizações e cidadãos de Minas Gerais e de todo o Brasil, atua no enfrentamento às pretensões \nminerárias  da  Vale.  A  Serra  do  Gandarela  abriga  a  última  grande  área  intacta  do  quadrilátero \nferrífero-aquífero e o mais importante aquífero e mananciais de água de alta qualidade da região, \nafluentes das bacias hidrográficas dos rios das Velhas (Bacia do Rio São Francisco) e Piracicaba \n(Bacia  do  Rio  Doce).  Por  esses  motivos,  a  sociedade  civil  organizada  solicitou  a  criação  de  um \nParque  Nacional  e  de  uma  Reserva  de  Desenvolvimento  Sustentável  (RDS).  Desconsiderando  a \nenorme  relevância  ambiental,  paisagística,  científica  e  cultural  da  região,  assim  como  o  amplo \ndebate  social  sobre  o  tema  e  sua  tramitação  no  âmbito  técnico  do  Instituto  Chico  Mendes  de \nConservação  da  Biodiversidade (ICMBio), o  Ministério do Meio Ambiente (MMA) encaminhou  e a \npresidente Dilma Rousseff criou, através de decreto em 13 de outubro de 2014, o Parque Nacional \nda  Serra  do  Gandarela[33],  sem  contemplar  em  sua  demarcação  as  áreas  que  reúnem  o  maior \nnúmero  de  atributos  que  justificam  a  criação  da  Unidade  de  Conservação  federal.

Em um período em que \nhá graves ameaças ao abastecimento de água e conflitos de uso na própria região Sudeste, não \nfaz  nenhum  sentido  criar  um  Parque  Nacional  excluindo  de  seus  limites  áreas  de  extrema \nrelevância ambiental e  hídrica. Muito menos permitir nesta área  a exploração mineral pretendida, \nprincipalmente  pela  Vale  com  os  projetos  Apolo,  Piacó  e  Baú.  A  Vale  fez  gestões  para  reduzir  a \nárea  do  Parque  Nacional.  Desde  2007,  a  empresa  insiste  em  concretizar  seus  empreendimentos \nminerários  na  região  e,  para  isso,  já  foram  diversas  as  suas  tentativas  para  ter  a  Mina  Apolo \nlicenciada.

Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts of water \nare used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. \n\nWater  is  the  mining   sector’s   main  input,  and  it  is  used  in  processing  and  transporting  ore.  The \nimpacts  of  this  activity  on  water  are  extremely  serious,  including  the  destruction  of  underground \nwater tables, deterioration of water quality when it is returned compared to when it was extracted, a \nreduction  in  its  availability,  and  contamination  of  rivers,  seas  and  springs  with  chemical  waste, \namong  other  things.  Thus,  mining  harms  not  just  the  use  of  water,  but  also  its  accumulation  and \nrenewal, causing an end to springs. Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts \nof water are used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. In just one hour \nof  operation,  these  pipelines  use  enough  water  to  supply  a  city  of  at  least  500,000  inhabitants \nduring  this  period.  In  2012,  there  were  more  permits  for  water  use  in  mining  than  in  industry  in \nBrazil. \n\nIn Canada, Vale’s  Voisey’s  Bay nickel mining project is very controversial due to the contamination \nof  Sandy  Pond,  which  had  a  unique  ecosystem.  Used  as  a  dumping  ground  for  waste,  the  pond \nwas  converted  into  a  basin  containing  more  than  400,000  metric  tons  of  waste,  according  to \ncomplaints from local organizations. As well as  Vale being the defendant in the largest public civil \nlawsuit  in   Canada’s   history   for   environmental  problems,  in  2010  it  was  sentenced  to  pay  around \nC$36 million (Canadian dollars) as compensation to more than 7,000 residents of Port Colborne in \nOntario.  \n\nIn Minas Gerais, Vale’s  birthplace,  there are numerous cases of conflicts between the use of water \nfor the company’s  operations  and  to  supply  the  population. In the municipality of Catas Altas, Vale \nextracts  iron  ore  from  São  Luiz  Mine  in  the  district  of  Morro  da  Água  Quente.  This  mine  was \nexpanded  in  2007,  and  mining  has  since  taken  place  very  near  the  community   and   the   district’s  \nwater  supply  source.  Residents  have  noted  that  some  springs  are  silting  up  and  that  the  flow  of \nwatercourses has reduced considerably. In addition, problems arising  from  the  mine’s  dust  and  air  \npollution have also become much worse. Despite this, Vale plans to reopen Tamanduá Mine, which \nwas  inactive  for  around  15  years.  This mine  is  located  even  closer  to  the  community  of  Morro  da \nÁgua  Quente,  and  dangerously  near  the  water  source  that  supplies  the  main  town  in  the \nmunicipality of Catas Altas. In  other  words,  the  town’s  two  water  sources  are  jeopardized  by  Vale’s  \noperations. The water security of more than 5,000 people is at stake. \n\nAnother serious conflict  regarding  Vale’s  water  use  is  found  in  its ore slurry pipelines, in which iron \nore slurry is pumped using water for 24 hours a day. Samarco (a company in which Vale has a 50% \nstake) operates three ore slurry pipelines in Minas Gerais, from Alegria Mine in Mariana to the Port \nof  Ubu  in  Anchieta,  Espírito  Santo.  Each  of  these  pipelines  is  more  than  400  km  long.  The  three \npipelines consume an average of  4,400 m³ of water per hour. After decades destroying springs in \nthe municipalities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, the company needed to extract water for  Samarco’s \nore  slurry  pipelines  and  plants  from  the  Conceição  River,  located  in  the  district  of  Brumal,  in  the \nmunicipality  of  Santa  Bárbara.  The  water pipe built for this  purpose uses  82%  of  the  river’s   water \npotential. Residents of the region say that in the dry season, the river literally dries up completely at \nthe   water   pipe’s   inflow   point.  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  2010,  one  of  Samarco’s   ore   slurry  \npipelines burst in the municipality of Espera Feliz, causing a major environmental disaster. \n\nDestruction of Gandarela Hills and their water resources \n\nFor  seven  years,  the  Movement  to  Preserve  the  Gandarela  Hills,  featuring  the  involvement  of \nvarious organizations and citizens from Minas Gerais and across Brazil, has been fighting against \nVale’s  mining  plans. The Gandarela Hills are home to the last large intact area of the ‘iron-aquifer \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

For these reasons, organized civil  society requested the creation  of a National  Park \nand  a  Sustainable  Development  Reserve.  Disregarding   the   region’s   enormous   environmental, \nlandscape, scientific and cultural relevance, as well as extensive social debate about the topic and \nits processing within the technical scope of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation \n(ICMBio),  the  Environment  Ministry  submitted  plans  for,  and  President  Dilma  Rousseff  created, \nthrough  a  decree  on  October  13,  2014,  the  Gandarela  Hills  National  Park[33],  without  including \nwithin its boundaries the areas with the largest number of attributes that justified the creation of the \nfederal Conservation Unit. Thus, they endangered this priceless social and environmental heritage, \nirreparably  harming  essential  water  sources  for  neighboring  municipalities,  such  as  Caeté,  Nova \nLima, Raposos, Rio Acima, Santa Bárbara and Barão de Cocais, as well as the last strategic water \nreserve to supply Belo Horizonte and its metropolitan region. At a time when there are serious water \nsupply   threats   and   usage   conflicts   in   Brazil’s   Southeast   region,  it  does  not  make  any  sense  to \ncreate  a  National  Park  whose  boundaries  exclude  areas  of  extreme  environmental  and  water \nresource  relevance.  It  makes  even  less  sense  to  permit  mining  exploration  there,  especially  that \nplanned  by  Vale  through  its  Apolo,  Piacó  and  Baú  projects.  Vale  made  efforts  to  reduce  the \nNational   Park’s   area.  Since  2007,  the  company  has  been  insisting  on  implementing  its  mining \nprojects in the region, and to this end it has made various attempts to get Apolo Mine licensed. This \ncompany, therefore, does not respect the importance of the Gandarela Hills, not even to guarantee \nwater for millions of people.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nApolo Project \n\nVale  began  studies  for  the  Apolo  Project  around  2006,  conducting  hydrogeological  studies  that \nsupported  the  respective  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  in  its  diagnosis  and  prognosis  of  the \nproject’s   impacts   on   the   region’s   water   resources.  The  results  of  these  studies  indicate  that  the \nApolo Project will not harm the water supply of Belo Horizonte and adjacent cities, and any impacts \nwill  be  duly  mitigated  in  line  with  prevailing  environmental  legislation  and  demands  by  the \nenvironmental licensing authority. \n\nThe Apolo Project’s  area  is  home  to  the water supply sources for the cities of Barão de Cocais and \nCaeté,  and  part  of  the  city  of  Belo  Horizonte.  The  main  allegation  against  the  project  among \norganized civil society is that there are several springs in its area of influence and that this is likely \nto affect the water supply of part of the local population. \n\nAlso regarding water supply issues, considering the study to evaluate water availability in the basins \nof the upper stretches of the Velhas and Paraopeba rivers, which are home to springs that feed the \nmetropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, COPASA’s  water  extraction  facility  from  the Velhas River is \nlocated around 7 km upstream from where it is joined by the Prata Stream, which is the watercourse \ninfluenced by the Apolo Project’s  implementation  area. \n\nTherefore, we  clarify  that  the  project’s  area  of  influence  is  not  related  to  the  water  extraction  points  \nused for the water supply in question. In addition, all water withdrawal points that currently supply \nthe metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte are located in areas of influence of mining projects, but no \nimpacts by these projects  on  water stocks allocated for public supply  have  ever been detected or \nforecast.  We  also  stress  that  in  our  environmental  controls,  we  have  also  created  an  extensive \nnetwork to monitor indicators, such as the quality and flow of watercourses. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Since then, the project has not moved forward. It is currently suspended. \n\nIt is important to note that Vale will only start implementing the Apolo Project once its environmental \nlicense has been duly approved, and in accordance with prevailing environmental legislation. \n\nCatas Altas \n\nIn 2010, Vale obtained an operating license to expand its activities at São Luiz Mine. \n\nVale clarifies that its activities do not interfere with water extraction points used to supply the district \nof Morro da Água Quente  and Catas Altas, which are found upstream  from  the  mine’s  operations. \nThe company monitors the flow and quality of water in the watercourses located around the project. \nThe  results  of  this  monitoring  have  been  in  accordance  with  the  parameters  determined  by \nlegislation. \n\nWith regard to particulate matter emissions, the company takes measures to control dust and it has \nan  air  quality  monitoring  network  to  measure  particulate  levels  in  the  area  around  the  operation. \nThe monitoring results have been within the limits determined by legislation. \n\nAll this monitoring work is officially registered with the environmental authority, in accordance with \nthe  operating  license’s  conditions. \n\nSamarco \n\n The   water   resource   management   is   a   fundamental   issue   on   Samarco’s   operations   and   plans.  \nSeveral  studies  and  project  have  being  developed  in  order  to  adopt  more  sustainable  practices. \nThis  work  is  oriented  by  the  aims  of  optimize  and  rationalize  the  water  use,  reduce  the  need  of \nmake-up  water,  increase  recirculation  water  rate  and  ensure  the  water  quality  discarded  to \nenvironment. \n\nIt’s   important   to   highlight   that   Samarco   does   not   withdraw   water   specifically   to   feed   the   pipelines.  \nThe water to the transport came from iron ore processing withdraw. So, regardless the pipeline, the \nwithdraw water is necessary due the industrial process nature. Part of water is treated and returns \nto water bodies close to company with quality level according the law requirements. About 90% of \nwater demanded by Samarco is recycled and the part used on pipeline is separated and used again \nin the pelletizing process in Espírito Santo. Those initiatives avoid, in large scale, the need of new \nwithdraw out of the environment. Nowadays Samarco uses 1632m3/h of water to transport ore pulp \nand not 4400m3/h as described. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAll   Samarco’s   withdraw   is   conducted   according   the   standards   established   by   the   authorizations  \nissued  for  the  competent  environmental  agency  after  conducted  studies  attesting  the  viability. \nSamarco has permits in five different places in order to avoid water stress in a particular place. \n\nThe  water  withdrawal  on  Santa  Bárbara  river  is  part  of  its  strategy  and  started  with  the  third \nconcentration plant operation launched on April 2014. The information about the use of 82% of the \nriver  capacity  is  unfounded.  According  to  the  IGAM  Ordinance  nº49/2010,  article  5º,  §1º,   “The \nmaximum limit of consumption withdraws to be permitted in the portion of water basing limited for a \nconsidered section, in natural conditions, will be 30% of Q7,10 (minimum flow rate in 7 (seven) days \nand  10  (ten)  years  of  recurrence)  being  assured  downstream  of  the  withdraw  minimum  residual \nflows  equal  of  70%  of  the  Q7,10”.  So,  the  water  used  by  Samarco  doesn’t  restrict others withdraws \nin  different  points  of  Santa  Bárbara  river.  As  established  by  the  law  above    on  that  specific  point \nwould be  allowed  withdraw of 3467m3/h and Samarco is allowed to  withdraw up to 2050m3/h, as \nthe flow rate defined by the permit – “Portaria  de  Outorga  Nº01323/2001”.   \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  in  2012  was  published  the  Resolution  SEMAD-IGAM  nº1548,  March \n29th, 2012 changing the permitted withdraw flow rate to 50% of Q7,10. On this conditions would be \nallowed to withdraw 5778m3/h on that point of Santa Bárbara river. \n\nThe  Federal  law  13199/99  (National  law  of  waters)  item  I,  Art.  3º  established  “the  right  of  access  of  \nall   to   water   resources,   priority   to   public   supply   and   ecosystem   maintenance”.   So   the   Samarco’s  \nwithdraws do not compete with human supply. In 38 years of pipelines operation there is no records \nof conflicts for water use in the neighborhood of company operations. \n\nRelated to the pipeline leaking in 2010 it should be noticed this is a localized occurrence identified \nand treated by the company with agility and transparency. \n\nSamarco,  immediately  after  the  identification  of  the  occurrence  informed  and  involved  the \ncompetent  authorities  and  took  care  of  all  work  to  rehabilitate  the  area.  The  action  was  properly \nfollowed  by  the  competent  authority  and  received  the  municipality  formal  recognition  for  the \ncompany responsibility and especially for the way of conduction the actions related to the fact. \n\nVoyces Bay \n\nVale is committed to long term sustainable development  – Vale’s  approach to sustainability entails \nbalancing environmental, social and economic factors from a macro perspective to achieve a result \nthat prioritizes the greater good and the best interests of the communities in which it operates.  The \noutcomes  of  the  Sandy  Pond  and   Port   Colborne   legal   matters   demonstrate   Vale’s   respect   for   the  \nenvironment and record of compliance with prevailing laws and regulations.  \n\nSandy Pond  \n\nThe  “Sandy  Pond  Alliance  for  the  Protection  of  Canadian  Waters”  filed an Application in the Federal \nCourt of Canada in June 2010  asking that  the  Metal  Mining Effluent  Regulations (\"MMER\")  under \nthe Fisheries Act, which permit the use of a lake or pond as a Tailings Impoundment Area (\"TIA\"), \nbe  declared  void  and  unlawful.  The  Application  does  not  seek  a  specific  remedy  or  order  against \nVale  but  rather  named  the  Government  of  Canada  and  challenged  the  Government  decision  to \nenact certain MMER provisions. The Sandy Pond Alliance position was that the Fisheries Minister \nand the Cabinet were not authorized under the Fisheries Act to enact regulations which permit the \nuse  of  a  fish  habitat  (i.e.,  a  lake  or  pond)  for  tailings,  the  result  of  which  is  the  destruction  of \nfreshwater aquatic life in the habitat. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe  Court  dismissed  the  Sandy  Pond  Application  on  31  October  2013  (meaning,  the  Court \ndetermined that MMER are not unlawful).  The status of this matter is that the Sandy Pond Alliance \napplication was rejected by the Court without impact to Vale.   \n\nThe  Sandy  Pond  site  emerged  as  the  clear  and  most  responsible  selection  after  detailed \nexamination and comparison of several possible sites for the RSF.  A requirement related to the use \nof  Sandy  Pond  is  the  protection  of  fish  and  fish  habitat  under  the  Fisheries  Act  of  Canada.  The \nDepartment  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans   (DFO)   operates   on   the   “No   Net   Loss”   principle:   any   loss   of  \nproductive  fish  habitat  has  to  be  offset  in  an  acceptable  manner  so  that  there  is  no  net  loss  in \ncapacity.  Fish  habitat  can  be  altered  only  if  authorized  by  the  Minister  of  Fisheries.  Such \nauthorization  is  granted  only  if  an  acceptable  Fish  Habitat  Compensation  Plan  is  in  place  and  a \nbinding agreement is reached on its implementation. \n\nVale has legally relocated the freshwater aquatic life from Sandy Pond and continues to responsibly \nuse  Sandy  Pond   as   a   residue   storage   site   for   Vale’s   Long   Harbour   processing   plant   operations.    \nThis  is  all  in  accordance  with  prevailing  laws  and  regulations.    The  Sandy  Pond  residue  storage \nfacility (RSF) is one of 19 authorized impoundment areas in Canada. \n\nPCR Class Action Lawsuit \n\nA  class  action  lawsuit  in  Ontario  court  alleged  that  historic  emissions   from   Vale’s   Port   Colborne  \nrefinery had resulted in elevated nickel levels in the soil  and adversely affected property values of \nneighboring properties.  Vale acknowledged that there is nickel in the soil and that the majority of it \ncame  from  the  historical  (pre-1960)  operation  of  the  nickel  refinery  in  Port  Colborne.  Vale  put \nforward the position that the refinery was at all times operated in compliance with the environmental \nregulation  of  the  day  and  that  the  level  of  nickel  in  soil  was  below  the  standards  set  to  protect \nhuman health.  \n\nAt trial, the judge awarded damages to the Class Action plaintiffs in the amount of CDN$36 million \nplus  legal  costs.  This  decision  was  subsequently  reversed  by  the  Ontario  Court  of  Appeal, \naccepting  all  of  Vale’s  positions.  Thus  no  payment  by  Vale  to the Plaintiffs was required.  \n\nVale  recognizes  the  historical  soil  contamination  and  has  worked  to  undertake  Risk  Assessments \n(RAs),  as  required  by  the  Ontario  Ministry  of  the  Environment  (MOE).  The  RAs  evaluated  human \nhealth risk, ecological risk and risk to agricultural crops.  The studies provided further evidence that \nthe level of soil contamination does not represent a health risk to the  community.  The  MOE’s  review  \nof  Vale’s  RAs  is  ongoing.  Vale  continues  to  implement  its  risk  management  plan  to  address  areas  \nwith higher nickel soil contamination. \n\n17)  Xikrin: compensation programs \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “No  Pará,  o  povo  Xikrin  realizou  diversos  protestos  em  2014.

During  one  of \nthem, the  entrance  to  Vale’s  Onça Puma project in the Ourilândia do Norte region was blocked and \nproduction  halted.  The  indigenous  people  allege  that  nickel  mining  is  causing  extensive  harm  to \npeople’s   health   and   affecting   the   Cateté  River,  which  serves  the  community.  According  to  the \nFederal Prosecution Ministry, despite the health impacts on the Xikrin people, Vale has not begun \nany  compensation  program  and  has  not  complied  with  any  of  the  established  conditions.  Another \nVale  project,  the  Salobo  copper  extraction  project,  is  also  causing  negative  consequence  for  this \nsame people, by affecting areas where they collect nuts. For this reason, Salobo is the object of a \npublic civil inquiry under way at the Federal Prosecutor’s  Office  in  Marabá, Pará.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nOnça Puma \n\nAll  the  stages  of  the  Onça  Puma  project  were  planned  so  as  to  prevent  and  safeguard  the \nindigenous  people  and  their  territories  from  any  negative  consequences  that  may  arise  from  its \nimplementation or during its operational phase.  \n\nVale  also  understands  that,  following  the  completion  of  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté  Ethno-Ecological \nStudies,  which  detailed  the  impacts  on  these  indigenous  areas  more  directly,  and  proposed \nmitigating  actions,  strategies  and  measures  for  them,  any  detailed  information  needed  for  the \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA-RIMA)  has  already  been  supplied.  Based  on  the  impacts \nidentified  in  this  study,  a  Basic  Environmental  Plan  featuring  appropriate  mitigation  programs  was \nproduced  with  the  indigenous  community  participation.  However,  the  indigenous  people  are  not \nallowing  the  programs  that  were  defined,  with  their  participation  and  decision,  to  be  implemented \nwithin their indigenous land. They want extra financial resources to be paid by the company for their \nconsumption needs. The mitigation plan is established to have the financial resources being applied \nin  environmental  conservation,  health,  safety  improvement,  land  securing  and  monitoring,  cultural \nstrengthening  and  productive  activities,  in  an  equitable  way.  They  are  not  supposed  to  pay  for \ncosting  and  acquisition  of  consumer  goods  that  have  no  correlation  with  the  impacts  and  often \ngenerate  new  negative  impacts  to  these  populations,  including  their  socio-cultural  aspects  and \nhealth.   The direct financial transfer is not either equitably distributed by them. Therefore, some get \nmore  resources  than  others,  generating  new  internal  ruptures.  The  simple  increase  of  resources \nposes more threat to these people. A strong long term sustainable plan with good governance and \nmanagement  is  needed.    Vale  has  been  conducting  all  the  activities  outside  the  indigenous  land \ndefined in the Basic Environmental Plan, including the following: (i) Monitoring of water quality in the \nXikrin do Cateté indigenous land (monitoring of concentrations of heavy metals that could affect the \nindigenous  people’s  health);;  and  (ii)  Actions  to  mitigate  the  silting of the Cateté River (proposal for \nstructures to control this silting). This monitoring work has shown no change in turbidity that could \ninfluence   the   water   body’s   visual   characteristics.   Regarding   heavy   metals,   the   anomalies   found  \n(higher  concentrations)  are  related  to  regional  and/or  local  geology,  including  hydro-chemical \nprocesses,  water-rock  interactions,  the  time  that  water  spends  in  the  aquifer,  and  speed  of \ninfiltration. \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  since  1982  Vale  has  provided  support  to  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté \nindigenous  people,  complementing  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  Brazilian  state,  providing \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The  three  villages  without  Agreements  in  place  are  receiving  urgent  and \nemergency services, as well as high-complexity or high-cost specialist  treatments,  reflecting  Vale’s  \ncommitment  to  respect  the  communities  it  interacts  with,  in  order  to  promote  the  development  of \nlasting  and  healthy  relations  with  the  Gavião  people.  At  no  time  has  Vale  refused  to  engage  in \ndialogue  with  the  Gavião  people,  and  we  have  always  respected  their  culture  and  social \norganization. \n\n19)  Biopalma \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Seguindo a lógica do marketing verde, em 2011, a Vale comprou 70% \nda  empresa  Biopalma  da  Amazônia  S.A.

A  destinação  principal  do  óleo  é  a  produção  de  biodiesel  pela  Vale  para \nalimentar sua frota de locomotivas, máquinas e os equipamentos de grande porte das operações \nno  Brasil.  No  entanto,  a  Biovale  é  denunciada  por  conflitos  territoriais,  desmatamento  e \ncontaminação  por  agrotóxicos  de  igarapés,  que  alimentam  inúmeros  rios  da  região.  Em  2014,  o \nInstituto  Evandro  Chagas  comprovou  a  contaminação  por  agrotóxico  em  plantações  de  dendê, \nregistradas em um relatório de perícia feita nos municípios de São Domingos do Capim, Concórdia \ndo  Pará, Bujaru  e  Acará.  Além disso, desde 2008 quilombolas de Concórdia,  no  Pará, acusam a \nterras,  ameaçando-os  com \nempresa  de  pressionar  agricultores  para  venderem  suas \ndesapropriações e índios Tembé do território Turé-Mariquita denunciam os impactos das atividades \nda empresa em suas terras, através da contaminação por agrotóxicos, tendo os índios apreendido, \nem protesto, em 2014, oito carros e tratores da Biopalma.

Em  relação  ao  preço  dos \nalimentos,  apesar  de  existirem  fatores  como  situações  de  sazonalidade,  quebra  de  safra  e \nentraves  na  comercialização,  o  supervisor  técnico  do  Departamento  Intersindical  de  Estatística  e \nEstudos Socioeconômicos (Dieese), do Pará, Roberto Sena, avalia que existe uma relação entre o \navanço do dendê e a alta dos alimentos.

However,  Biovale  has  been  denounced  for \nterritorial  conflicts,  deforestation  and  pesticide  contamination  of  streams   feeding   the   region’s  \nnumerous rivers. In 2014, The Evandro Chagas Institute found pesticide contamination in palm tree \nplantations, as recorded in a report by a specialist produced in the municipalities of São Domingos \ndo  Capim,  Concórdia  do  Pará,  Bujaru  and  Acará.  Furthermore,  since  2008  members  of  a \nquilombola community in Concórdia, Pará, have accused the company of pressuring farmers to sell \ntheir  lands,  threatening  them  with  expropriation,  and  Tembé  indigenous  people  in  the  Turé-\nMariquita  territory   have   complained   about   the   impacts   of   the   company’s   activities   on   their   lands, \nthrough  pesticide  contamination.  In  2014,  these  indigenous  people  seized  eight  cars  and  tractors \nbelonging  to  Biopalma  in  protest.  In  other  words,  behind  the  image  of  a  company  that  is \nsustainable, responsible and concerned about future generations, there lies the same old practice \nof usurping and neglecting territories and communities. With regard to food prices, notwithstanding \nfactors  such  as  seasonal  situations,  crop  failures  and  sales  obstacles,  the  technical  supervisor  of \nthe Pará Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese), Roberto Sena, \nbelieves there is a relationship between the advance of palm trees and the rise in food prices.The \nproblem of family farming is the lack of a production policy; people have stopped growing cassava \nin  favor  of  palm  trees,’  he  says.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nBiopalma operates strictly according to labor and environmental legislation, and it clarifies that it has \nhad access to the “Technical report to evaluate surface water and bottom sediment located in areas \npotentially  impacted  by  palm  oil  tree  cultivation  in  the  municipalities  of  Concórdia  do  Pará  and \nBujaru,” produced by the Evandro Chagas Institute. This document does not contain any evidence \nof  pesticide-contaminated  surface  water,  and  its  analyses  of  sediments  detected  residues  of  DDT \nand Endossulfan – products that are not used by Biopalma. \n\nThe  company  emphasizes  that  it  does  not  have  any  activities  inside  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion.  Despite  this,  it  carries  out  sustainable  projects  to  support  the  indigenous  community, \nfocused  on  education,  health, \nfood  security,  basic  sanitation,  maintenance,  and  access \ninfrastructure.  For  example,  the  company  has  equipped  a  health  center  and  installed  micro  water \nsupply  facilities,  among  other  things,  all  in  accordance  with  the  ethno-environmental  report \nproduced in 2011 and updated in August 2012, and under Funai’s  supervision. \n\nIt should be noted that despite the actions taken by Biopalma to support the indigenous community \nof the Turé Mariquita territory, on December 24, 2014 indigenous person Lucinho Tembé began to \nlead  a  series  of  illegal  actions  against  the  company,  including  the  unlawful  seizure  of  vehicles, \ninterruptions of activities, threats to company employees, and theft of objects and fuel. In exchange \nfor the seized goods, the indigenous people presented a series of demands, which included, among \nother materials items, a monthly transfer of cash unconnected to any actions. The goods were only \nrecovered by Biopalma following a court ruling by the judge of the Second Federal Court of Belém. \nWe  emphasize  that  there  is  no  proof  of  any  impacts  caused  by  Biopalma’s   activities   on   the  \nindigenous territory. In addition, the study conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute did not cover \nthe municipality of Tome Açu, where the indigenous community in question is located. \n\nThus,  the  Federal  Prosecution  Ministry  filed  Injunction  in  order  to  investigate  the  alleged \ncontamination  of  the  indigenous  territory.  Biopalma  was  summoned  and  it  presented  its  defense. \nFollowing the legal procedures, the lawsuit was dismissed  by the judge of the Ninth Federal Court \nof Belém. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n34 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEven  though  the  lawsuit  was  dismissed,  Biopalma    started  to  hold  meetings  with  the  indigenous \ncommunity  and  FUNAI  with  the  aim  at  reaching  an  agreement  to  ensure  good  relations  with  the \nparties  involved.  The  indigenous  leaders  have  presented  their  claims  and  Biopalma  is  evaluating \ntheir  pertinence in relation  to their areas of activity, namely  education, health, food security,  basic \nsanitation, maintenance, and access infrastructure. At the moment there are no direct conflicts.  \n\nRegarding the allegation of deforestation,  it should be noted that the  Biopalma project has a  zero \nrate of deforestation, as it is exclusively planting palm trees in areas already altered, in line with the \nobligations  arising  from  environmental  legislation  and  the  company’s   objectives  and  principles  to \nconserve the biodiversity and ecosystem around it. As a result, the company is maintaining natural \nareas  of  habitat,  thereby  contributing  to  environmental  balance  and  the  conservation  of  natural \nresources in the region. \n\nIn the last six (6) months, it was identified that the  company’s  areas  allocated for “Reserva Legal”  \nsites  (legally  mandated  minimum  areas  of  native  habitat)  and/or  considered  Permanent \nPreservation  areas  have  been  systematically  invaded  for  illegal  logging,  especially  in  the \nmunicipalities of Acará, Tomé Açú and Concórdia do Pará. \n\nIn order to reduce incidents of illegal logging, Biopalma filed crime reports at the police station in the \nmunicipality where each property in question is located, and made a request to the Pará Specialist \nEnvironmental Police Department (DEMA) to launch a police inquiry to put a definitive end to such \nactions,  which  harm  not  only  the  company,  but  society  as  a  whole.  Biopalma  has  also  reported \nthese cases to the environmental authorities.  As a result of the measures taken by  Biopalma, the \nCivil  Police  have  already  carried  out  two  operations  in  the  region,  culminating  in  the  seizure  of \nillegally extracted timber.  \n\nRegarding the aforementioned territorial conflicts, Biopalma states that at no time has it made any \nkind  of  threats  to  rural  farmers  located  in  the  region  to  sell  their  lands,  and  it  has  certainly  not \nundertaken  any  planting  work  and/or  acquired  properties  belonging  to  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion. As stated before, Biopalma has been planting in already degraded areas. \n\nWith  regard  to  the  conflict  with  the  quilombola  community,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  request  to \ndemarcate  the  Amarqualta  quilombola  territory  was  filed  in  2011,  after  Biopalma  acquired  the \nproperties.  As  soon  as  it  became  aware  of  the  request  for  quilombola  demarcation,  the  company \nsuspended the planting of palm trees in the contested area and began to monitor the demarcation \nprocess with the Pará Land Institute (ITERPA), the body responsible for the process of demarcating \nquilombola  territory.  Alongside  the  administrative  process  under  way  at  ITERPA,  the  State  Public \nProsecution Ministry instigated a public civil inquiry to investigate the claims made by the members \nof the quilombola community regarding the activities of palm tree-growing companies, particularly in \nterms of land conflicts involving an area that is awaiting land title. Because of these administrative \nprocesses, Biopalma has had several meetings with ITERPA, the quilombola communities and the \nState  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  to  resolve  the  situation  through  negotiation.  At  the  moment,  the \nvalidity  of  the  land  titles  for  overlapping  properties  claimed  by  Biopalma  and  ITERPA  is  being \nevaluated. \n\nLaunched  in  February  2010,  Biopalma’s   Family   Farming   Program  consists  of  a  partnership  to \nproduce  palm  oil  fruit  with  rural  farming  families  in  northeast  Pará.  The  farmers  are  funded  via \nBanco  da  Amazônia,  Banco  do  Brasil  and  Banco  do  Estado  do  Pará  (Banpará),  with  credit  lines \nsupplied  by  the  National  Program  to  Strengthen  Family  Farming  (PRONAF  –  ECO  DENDÊ),  a \nfederal  government  program  to  acquire  saplings,  maintain  plantations  and  grant  financial  support \nfor subsistence needs in the first three years after planting until the first crops are harvested. \n\nAround  650  families  are  partners  of  this  Biopalma  program,  dedicating  part  of  their  lands  to  palm \ntree  plantations  and  receiving  technical  assistance,  as  well  as  guaranteed  purchases  of  raw \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n35 \n\n \n \n \n\fmaterials  for  30  years  of  production.  Farmers  already  at  the  harvesting  stage,  i.e.  at  least  three \nyears  after  planting,  have  seen  a  significant  increase  in  their  purchasing  power,  which  is  also \nresulting in growth in the acquisition of goods and services in  the  program’s  areas of influence. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  to  strengthen  family  farming  among  the  producers  served  by  the  program, \nBiopalma  conducts  monitoring  and  provides  technical  support  needed  for  the  families  to  develop \ntheir agricultural production, given that they also grow other crops on the same property. \n\nOne  of  the  ways  used  to  encourage  families  to  plant  a  variety  of  crops  is  the  “Productivity  Trio,” a \nprogram  formalized  through  a  partnership  between  Biopalma  and  Embrapa  that  involves  a \ncombination of three components of a cassava production system and their application at the family \nproperties in question.  \n\nThe Productivity Trio has the capacity to  use the spaces between  the rows of palm trees to grow \ncassava  roots  without  harming  the  perfect  plant  development  of  the  palm  trees.  The  Productivity \nTrio  has  been  implemented  in  cleared  areas  where  the  slash  and  burn  technique  had  previously \nbeen usual. By using the Trio system, it has been possible to double cassava yields  without using \nfertilizer, by focusing on using the best spacing to plant seedlings, clearing the areas and selecting \ncassava seedlings. As the planted palm trees take  three  years to begin producing fruit, and given \nthat cassava crops are the foundation of family farming in the area, cassava is grown between the \nrows of palm trees, in line with the following principles: \n\n  Non-encouragement of monoculture in family farming; \n\n  Diversification  of  production,  given  that  many  other  crops  besides  cassava  may  be \nintercropped (including corn, rice, beans and  watermelon), provided that technical spacing \ncriteria are followed, as guided by Biopalma’s  technical  team; \n\n  Guaranteed food security for the families benefited by Biopalma’s  Family  Farming  Program; \n\n  Guaranteed income even before oil palm fruit production begins,  given that the palm trees \n\ncomplement income produced by other food crops (beans, corn, rice and fruits). \n\nBiopalma  is  a  company  with  the  mission  to  produce  palm  oil  and  byproducts  in  a  sustainable \nmanner.  Our  operational  excellence  makes  us  a  leading  company  in  the  market,  and  this \nrecognition  has  only  been  possible  thanks  to  work  performed  with  respect  for  safety  and  the \nenvironment. \n\n20)  Belo Monte \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Um dos projetos mais polêmicos em que a Vale está envolvida, na sua \ncrescente busca por energia, é a construção da usina hidrelétrica de Belo Monte na Volta Grande \ndo Rio Xingu, no estado do Pará.

Vale  is also responsible for polluting the sea  and modifying  its biodiversity  due to iron ore \nsedimentation  in  the sea  in the region of  Camburi,  in Vitória. It is  also  possible  to observe similar \nsituations  in  São Luís, Maranhão,  where fishermen are affected by  the  Port  of Ponta  da  Madeira, \nand in Malaysia, where the Teluk Rubiah Maritime Terminal was opened by Vale in 2014. \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nIn  São  Luís,  Maranhão,  Vale  monitors  the  area  around  the  piers  of  Ponta  da  Madeira  Maritime \nTerminal, located in São Marcos Bay. This work is done in partnership with the Federal University of \nMaranhão  (UFMA),  through  its  Oceanography  Department,  and  consists  of  evaluating  the  marine \necosystem of waters in the area around Vale’s  port  operations. The results indicate that there is no \nevidence of alterations to the marine environment composed of fauna and flora organisms. A team \nof  researchers  in  different  fields,  including  bioscience,  oceanography,  zoology  and  geochemistry, \nuses modern equipment to measure water and sediment quality parameters. \n\nTKCSA clarifies that the decline in fishing in Sepetiba Bay has been occurring since the 1970s for \nnumerous reasons that are not influenced by the company, which began its construction activities in \n2005  and  started  up  in  June  2010.  All  the  compensatory  measures  for  fishing,  as  established  by \nINEA, have been met by the company. \n\nIn  Vitória,  Vale  produced  and  officially  submitted  the  complementary  studies  requested  by  the \nenvironmental  authorities  following  an  analysis  of  work  presented  in  July  2013.

It should be \nnoted that the material in  question,  deposited during the  1970s,  is confined  to the far north of the \nbeach and has not caused any impacts on the rest of the shore. It is also important to emphasize \nthat  since  the  1980s  the  company  has  used  control  measures  to  impede  this  kind  of  occurrence, \nand has been conducting marine monitoring of the bay for 26 years. \n\nSechura   Bay   (Bahía   de   Sechura)   in   Peru,   located   near   Miski   Mayo   mining   company   (Vale’s  \nsubsidiary) is constantly monitored by OEFA, the Peruvian environmental inspection agency. OEFA \nensures   that   the   particulate  material   from   phosphate   rock   released   in   the   mining   company’s   truck  \nboarding area is within the limits established by law. Other renowned institutes in the country, such \nas the Technological Institute of Production (Instituto Tecnológico de la Producción  – ITP) and the \nPeruvian  Sea  Institute  (Instituto  del  Mar  del  Perú  –  IMARPE),  state  that  the  Sechura  Bay \ncontaminant factors are not related to the mining activity. Additionally, we report that the phosphate \nis transported in fully covered conveyor belts, which prevent contact of the product with the air. This \nmeasure is part of the continuous improvement action plan put in place by Miski Mayo in 2011. The \ncompany  reinforces  its  commitment  to  the  environmental  preservation  of  the  regions  where  it \noperates. In 2012 it urged authorities and other companies in the Piura region to join efforts towards \nproper sanitation in the Sechura Bay in Peru. As a result, in 2014 a Supreme Resolution (nº 288-\n2014-PCM) was issued and a number of meetings and participatory monitoring activities under this \ninitiative took place. As for the previous consultation in San Martin de Sechura; the process is not \ncarried out by the investment project lead, but by the relevant governmental body which, in the case \nof the mining sector in Peru, is the Ministry of Energy and Mines. In order to approve inception of \nMiski Mayo operations, the Ministry established that there was no need for a previous consultation, \ngiven that San Martín de Sechura Community is not an indigenous population. In addition to that, at \nthat particular moment, previous consultation processes had not been regulated by local legislation \n(which  entered  into  force  in  2011).  The  Vice  ministry  of  Intercultural  Affairs  within  the  Ministry  of \nCulture,  which  is  the  body  in  charge  of  recognizing  Indigenous  populations  in  Peru,  does  not \nacknowledge  the  presence  of  Indigenous  populations  in  the  Piura  department,  where  the  San \nMartín de Sechura community  is located. Even so, the company established a  lasting relationship \nwith neighborhood communities, providing them with information on the enterprise, clarifying doubts \nand  supporting  the  community  grievance  process,  which  is  fundamental  for  proper  social  impact \nmanagement.  \n\n22)  Piquiá de baixo, Açailândia, Maranhão \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “A luta pelo território em Piquiá de Baixo.

Ao tentar impugnar o processo de reconhecimento de \nterras  quilombolas,  a  Vale,  mais  uma  vez,  evidencia  o  seu  modus  operandi  de  viabilizar  seus \nempreendimentos  através  da  privação  dos  grupos  sociais  de  usufruírem  livremente  das  diversas \npossibilidades  sociais,  econômicas,  ambientais,  culturais  e  históricas  relacionadas  aos  seus \nterritórios.

By trying to challenge the process of recognizing \nthe  quilombola  lands,  Vale  once  more  demonstrates  its  modus  operandi  to  enable  its  projects  by \ndepriving social groups of free enjoyment of the different social, economic, environmental, cultural \nand  historical  possibilities  of  their  territories.  In  September  2014,  the  EFC  was  occupied  by  rural \nworkers  from  35  quilombola  communities  in  Maranhão,  who  demanded  a  series  of  measures  to \nguarantee  their  territorial  rights.  Complaints  have  also  been  submitted  to  the  Federal  Public \nProsecution  Ministry  by  the  National  Institute  for  Colonization  and  Agricultural  Reform  (Incra)  and \nthe Palmares Cultural Foundation regarding the fact that the railroad expansion work is being done \nwithout any compensatory  or  mitigating action  by the  company, causing direct impacts on several \nquilombola communities in the region. Following this protest, some members of these communities \nhave been sued in the courts or investigated in Federal Police inquiries established at  Vale S.A.’s  \nrequest.” \n\nVale’s  Response  \n\nDuring the land titling process for the quilombola communities of Monge Belo and Santa Rosa dos \nPretos, a cartographic error was  observed in the public notices published by  INCRA in the  official \ngazette  (DOU).  As  well  as  featuring  the  wrong  coordinates,  the  polygons  presented  in  the  public \nnotice overlapped the area  allocated to the right-of-way strip for the  EFC’s  operation.  Considering  \nthese  facts   and   with   the   safety   of   people   and   the   operation’s   maintenance   in   mind,   Vale  made  a \nrequest for the respective administrative corrections to be made as part of the land titling process \nfor these territories. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

These  commitments  include  the  construction  of  four  railroad  bridges,  one  of  which  was \ndelivered  in  June  2015.  Construction  work  on  the  second  bridge  began  in  March  2015  and  we \nexpect it  will be completed in February  2016. Accordingly,  we  will meet the schedule stipulated in \nthe court settlement, which provides for the construction of two more bridges, in 2017 and 2018. \n\nSince the agreement was signed, relations with the communities have progressed with no conflicts. \n\nOn  July  10,  2014,  the  president  of  the  National  Institute  for  Colonization  and  Agricultural  Reform \n(INCRA)  published  INCRA  Ordinance  355,  recognizing  and  declaring  the  lands  of  the  remaining \nquilombo community of Santa Rosa dos Pretos. \n\nAs part of the licensing process, the Palmares Cultural Foundation – the federal government body \nresponsible for the quilombola component in environmental licensing processes  – determined that \nthere  are  15  communities  in  the  Carajás  Railroad’s   area   of   direct   influence.  Of  these  15 \ncommunities,  nine  are  proceeding  with  the  process  of  implementing  initiatives  to  mitigate  and/or \ncompensate for impacts arising  from  the  EFC’s  operation  and  expansion  work, as specified in the \nBasic  Environmental  Plan,  which  was  validated  following  public  consultations.  These  initiatives \ninclude  sub-programs  to  strengthen  quilombola  culture,  to  support  communication,  to  promote \nsafety and to prevent people and animals from being hit by trains. Vale is waiting for approval from \nthe other six communities, where the corresponding initiatives have been suspended at the request \nof the Federal  Public  Defender’s  Office while the Palmares Cultural Foundation clarifies a number of \nmatters to this entity. \n\nVale remains in dialogue with all the communities and has made a request for approval from the six \ncommunities so that it can execute the initiatives provided for in the Basic Environmental Plan. \n\n26) \n\nThe  Vale  Foundation’s  Education Initiatives \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Através da Fundação Vale, a Vale S.A. investe em inúmeros projetos \nligados  à  educação  infantil  e  de  jovens  e  adultos,  tanto  dos  seus  trabalhadores,  quanto  nas \ncomunidades  próximas  aos  seus  empreendimentos.

These   projects   are   part   of   the   company’s   strategy   to   seek   legitimacy,  both  among \nsociety  and  in  the  markets.  Mining  is  a  sector  recognized  for  its  major  social  and  environmental \nimpacts.  As  a  result,  programs  linked  to  the  social  responsibility  of  companies  are  designed  to \nminimize  the  effects  inherent  to  mining  activity.  However,   in   Vale’s   projects   one   may   note   the  \ndevelopment of palliative  measures  that  take  advantage  of  the  state’s  omissions in the localities in \nquestion. In other words, Vale claims for itself a role that belongs to the state. The Vale Foundation \nfunctions  through  public-private  social  partnerships,  which  as  the  company  itself  describes,  are \npacts  between  government,  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  to  promote  regional  development, \nenabling  the  company  to  benefit  from  tax  incentives.  What  is  not  evident  is  how  its  social \nresponsibility  activities  interfere  with  decision-making  processes  within  the  public  authorities.  A \ngood  example  of  this  is  Vale’s   partnerships   with   Municipal   Education   Secretariats  to  offer \nprofessional  development  courses  for  teachers,  directors  and  supervisors  at  schools  looking  for \ncontinuing professional training. These courses, organized and conducted by the Vale Foundation, \nare  an  important  instrument  to   deploy   the   company’s   ideology  in  society,  making  its  vision \nhegemonic  and  directly  affecting  the  formation  of  social  subjectivity.  Besides  contributing  to  the \nconstruction  of  a  very  positive  image  for  the  company,  investment  in  sectors  such  as  education, \nhealth,  culture  and  the  environment  offer  various  possibilities  to  expose  facts  and  figures  that  are \nnot strictly financial about Vale, and serve to generate social value for the company, influencing its \nmarket value and role.

Furthermore, it will indirectly have a \nnegative effect on other fundamental rights such as Freedom of Association.  \n\nH&M firmly believes that employees in the garment industry should have the right to legal employment \ncontracts. We always require that the suppliers we work with follow national legislation and implement \nawards from the Arbitration Council Foundation. Today, a majority of the employees at the supplier \nfactories in Cambodia are employed on fixed duration contracts due to many years of misinterpretation \nof the labour legislation. Such a frequent use of fixed duration contracts is not acceptable for H&M.  \n\nTo achieve a change towards un-fixed duration contracts, that are valid for an unlimited time, H&M has \nimplemented stricter requirements towards the suppliers that we work with. Since 2015, the suppliers \nmust guarantee that workers that have been employed for two years should have an un-fixed duration \ncontract.  \n\n  Our stricter requirement is supported by the Arbitration Council Foundation, AFC.  \n  Suppliers that employ workers over two years on fixed duration contracts will be seen as being \n\nin violation of our code of conduct requirements. \n\n  All suppliers with this violation will be required to create a remediation plan for how to transfer \n\nworkers from fixed to un-fixed duration contracts. \n\n  Our factory auditors will then follow up on the implementation of these plans.  \n\nThe illegal use of short-term employment is an industry-wide problem and therefore, we also work \nclosely with other stakeholders in the industry such as suppliers, employers associations, trade unions, \ncivil society and other buyers as well as engage with the Cambodian government.

This was part of a general privatisation of\nZambian copper mining assets, supported by the World Bank.\n\nPrior to privatisation, the Mopani assets suffered from years of under-investment. At the time\nof Glencore’s acquisition, the business was in a parlous financial and physical condition,\nwhich required its corporate shareholders to spend over US$3 billion to redeveloping and\nexpanding operations.\n\nToday, more than 10,000 people work at Mopani. Mining is the highest paying industry in\nZambia. We estimate that each of our employees has an average of eight dependents. The\nsalary of our most junior employees is US$630 per month (K6,981), compared to the national\nminimum wage of US$102 (K1,132).\n\nContributing to local development\nSince privatisation Mopani’s shareholders have made, and continue to make, substantial\ncontributions to local, regional and national economic wellbeing and growth. Mopani has paid\nover US$895 million in taxes and has invested over US$250 million in the sustainable\ndevelopment of these communities in such areas as health, education, infrastructure, water\nand sanitation, agriculture and sport.\n\nEngaging with local communities\n\nEngaging community members is an essential aspect of Mopani’s commitment to good\ncorporate citizenship. Mopani has monthly meetings with the Kankoyo Community\nOrganisation, a body that represents the interest of the Kankoyo community, to discuss the\ntopics of interest to the community and to provide updates on its operations.\n\nMopani maintains complaints registers in the community, placed at various public places such\nas clinics, hospitals, the council library among others, where the public can log their\ncomplaints for Mopani’s attention. Members of the community also write to the site to raise\nconcerns; all letters are reviewed by management and relevant investigations are undertaken.\nAll such investigations are conducted, where appropriate, with the involvement of the relevant\nGovernment ministries and/or local authorities. To maintain the effectiveness of our grievance\nhandling systems, we run stakeholder forums throughout the communities around Mopani,\nwhere we engage with the community, as well as representatives of NGOs and local\nchurches to discuss issues of mutual concern.\n\nHealth\n\nMopani has invested in local health initiatives for many years and currently operates two\nhospitals and seven clinics. Mopani’s HIV/AIDS programme has seen the mother-to-child\ntransmission rate reduced from 35% in 2005 to zero in 2014. Mopani treated 18,000 people\nwith ARTs (anti-retroviral drugs) in 2014, 85% of whom were not associated with our\n\nGlencore plc\nBaaremattstrasse 3 ¢ PO Box 777 ¢ 6341 Baar ¢ Switzerland\nTelephone +41 41 709 20 00 « Fax +41 41 709 30 00\n\n\n\noperations but live in the surrounding communities. GBCHealth, a New York-based coalition\nof companies and organisations committed to investing in health matters, gave Mopani a\ncommendation in its Business Action on Health Awards 2013, to recognise our holistic\ncommunity HIV and AIDS programme.\n\nIn 2012, Mopani invested over US$250,000 in the establishment of two cervical cancer\nscreening centres at the Wusakile and Malcolm Watson hospitals respectively. The centres\nare unique to the region. To date over 2,400 women have been screened for cervical cancer.\nIn the same year, Mopani opened two centres for the treatment of club foot. To date the\ncentres have corrected this condition for 85 children.\n\nIn 2014, over 230,000 women attended Mopani’s health services — over 114,000 of which\nreceived treatments and health services provided by local township clinics.\n\nEducation\nMopani has supported local education and skills development initiatives for a number of\nyears. The company runs four schools in the communities in which we operate.\n\nIn Zambia, considerable progress has been made on the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goal No. 2: universal access to education, as evidenced by almost all children\nin Zambia completing primary school. However, the Ministry of Education notes that while the\ncompletion rate of high school has improved from 14.4% in 2002 to 31.7% in 2010, less than\n40% of graduates pass their final exams in secondary school — and only 19% of females do\nso. At the schools operated by Mopani, both primary and secondary levels have a 50:50\nattendance of boys and girls and maintain an impressive 100% pass rate.\n\nRecognising the skills shortage that exists in Zambia, the US$20 million state-of-the-art\nMopani Central Training Centre (MCTC) was opened in Mufulira in January 2014 to train male\nand female artisans in various mining, engineering and technical skills.\n\nThe MCTC is equipped with some of the world’s best engineering equipment and has a\nstudent population of 140 in the first intake, seven of which were women. The MCTC is being\nactively promoted with female students in the final year of high school, to encourage greater\nenrolment by women. The first class of fully trained artisans will graduate in 2016.\n\nTraining is open to Zambian school leavers and other local candidates seeking qualifications\nleading to a career within the mining industry. Mopani will spend a minimum of approximately\nUS$20,000 annually on each apprentice in standard training and other related costs. Other\nthan offering the training for free, Mopani also provides the students with upkeep allowances,\nmeals and accommodation as well as recreation facilities.\n\nImproving local air quality\n\nIn 2014, we completed a multi-year smelter upgrade project at Mopani, our most significant\ninvestment in the physical assets at Mopani. The US$500 million, three-stage upgrade was\ncompleted 15 months before the deadline agreed with the Zambian government.\n\nSince its construction in 1937, the plant had been emitting sulphur dioxide (SOz) freely into\nthe atmosphere, with a significant effect on local air quality. At the time of our acquisition of\nthe Mopani assets in 2000, we committed to upgrading the smelter and addressing the SO2\nemissions.\n\nCompletion of the work means that we now capture over 95% of Mopani’s SOz emissions,\ncontrasting significantly with the situation when we took over this asset in 2000 when no gas\nor dust emissions were captured. The smelter upgrade project has been one of the biggest\nenvironmental projects ever undertaken in Zambia.\n\n\n\nLocal procurement\n\nLocal procurement is a significant component of our contribution to local economic\ndevelopment. Mopani paid contractor and supplier companies US$800 million in 2014. Of\nthis, 68% was spent in Zambia, 59% in the Copperbelt region and 48% in Mufulira and Kitwe,\nthe two closest towns to Mopani.\n\nMopani operates a number of SME (small and medium enterprise) development and\nmentoring programmes including workshops aimed at assisting suppliers in bid preparation\nand expanding professional business management skills. The annual budget for these\nworkshops is US$230,000 and they are held in conjunction with, the Association of Mine\nContractors and Suppliers, the Zambia Development Agency, PUM Netherlands and the\nKitwe Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nMopani is also supporting the establishment of joint ventures between local Zambian\nsuppliers and internationally recognised companies. These partnerships are enabling a\ntransfer of skills to the local labour force.\n\nInvesting in infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure investments are a focal point of the region’s socioeconomic development. In\n2012, Mopani completed rehabilitation of the Kitwe ring road and the Mufulira-Sabina road,\nwhich cost US$4.5 million and US$10.5 million respectively, and funded an upgrade of an\nentire township’s sanitary infrastructure. In 2013, Mopani spent US$650,000 on rehabilitating\nlocal sport stadia, which were in serious disrepair.\n\nWe remain fully committed to the principles of transparency and responsible citizenship in the\nareas where we operate. Further information on our operations and our performance can be\nfound on our website: www.glencore.com.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMichael Fahrbach ‘\nGlobal Head of Sustainability"}

That was back in July 2012. \n\n2.  adidas Group was not sourcing product from PDB at the time of the strike, nor when the factory \nclosed a year later. Throughout this period the factory was making exclusively for another major \nsporting goods brand.  \n\n3.  However, because of our close relations with the affiliated trade union federation, we proactively \nreached out to the Indonesia government’s Manpower Department and asked them to mediate \nbetween the two parties at PDB. That proved unsuccessful. \n\n4.  We then assisted with the appointment of a highly reputable independent mediator, mutually \n\nagreed to by the factory management and the trade union, to help the two parties resolve their \ndispute. Regrettably, neither of the parties could come to an agreement. \n\n5.  We therefore recommended that the union continue to negotiate directly with Panarub, to find a \nsettlement for the 340 workers who had not accepted the factory’s termination offer, or take the \nmatter to court as is their legal right.  \n\n6.  No legal action has been taken and no settlement has been reached, despite sporadic \n\nengagements between the union and Panarub. \n\n7.  We have continued to call on both parties to return to the negotiating table and settle this case, \n\nfor the sake of the 340 workers.  \n\nWith respect to the provisions of the FOA Protocol which has also been mentioned in the website post, we \nbelieve the CCC is misinformed.  \n\nadidas Group was instrumental in the development of the FOA Protocol, working closely with the trade \nunion movement in Indonesia. As a brand, our suppliers are the anchor to this initiative; adidas Group’ \nsuppliers represent 60% of all of the manufacturers who have signed on to the Protocol. However, the \nwording within the FOA Protocol is very clear: it does not extend to subcontractors who are working for \nour main suppliers and therefore does not apply in this specific case.  \n\nWe trust this answers CCC’s concerns. \n\nSincerely, \n\nWilliam Anderson \nVice President  \nSocial and Environmental Affairs \nAsia Pacific"}

We see good progress, which is also reflected in Accord \ndata. To further speed up the remediation, we are currently working closely together with IndustriALL to \nensure the most efficient remediation in H&M supply chain and to use our combined leverage where needed. \nWe will continue our long-term investment by fully supporting our business partners in improving and \nupgrading their production facilities to safer and higher international standards as well as their management \ncapabilities, allowing them to become competitive in a sustainable way. \n\nFire exits are one of the most fundamental requirements for a supplier in order to be allowed to produce for \nH&M. There have always been clear escape routes in our suppliers factories although they are in the process \nof being improved in accordance with new standards. We are in close dialogue with the suppliers and are \nfollowing up on the work that remains to be done. According to the latest information, the total amount of \nissues that have been handled has increased by 80 percent since October 2015 \n\nWe are fully transparent with our supplier list and as such we welcome critical investigations.

There are \nmainly two reasons given for currently recommend that the building remain vacant until certain measures are \ntaken. \n\n1. Due to extensive structural damage to the 7th and 8th floor, a concern arises over the safety of all \nthe lower floors until a structural remediation plan which considers immediate and longer term \nremediation requirements is done. Until the structural assessment is done by a credible engineering \nfirm, and all immediate actions to ensure the safety of building occupants is completed, no occupation \nof the building is recommended. We will be telling our brands the same message. \n\n2. Due to extensive firefighting water usage and potential damage to electrical systems, a certified \nelectrician must check the electrical system prior to re-energizing the system. Until such time, no \noccupation of the building is recommended. \n\nWe strongly recommend Matrix to not start any production until Accord/Alliance recommended actions have \nbeen taken and factory is deemed safe for production again. It is very important that Matrix clearly \ncommunicates what is going on to workers and ensure them they will be compensated and taken care of \nresponsibly. H&M will ensure support to Matrix in this process, and we want to state that Matrix Sweater Ltd is \nfully cooperating in a responsible manner on the recommendations.   \n\nWe can at this time not give an estimate how long the factory will be suspended.  \n\nFeb 4, 2016: Accord statement and information on the fire at Matrix Sweaters Ltd \nhttp://bangladeshaccord.org/2016/02/statement-on-fire-at-matrix-sweaters-ltd/  \n\nSep 30, 2015: Fire and building safety in Bangladesh \nhttp://about.hm.com/en/news/newsroom/news.html/en/fire-and-building-safety-in-bangladesh.html \n\nOct 6, 2015: H&M comments on the report on the Bangladesh Fire and Building Safety \nhttp://about.hm.com/en/news/newsroom/news.html/en/hm-comments-on-the-report-on-the-bangladesh-fire-and-building-safety.html \n\nFor further information about the Accord and official status, please visit http://bangladeshaccord.org/  \n\nFor further information about our sustainability program, please visit http://www.hm.com/sustainability"}

H&M has one of the highest sustainability standards in the textile industry for its suppliers \nand have for many years put great efforts in the manufacturing countries to improve working conditions \nand strengthen workers' rights. We are humble about the challenge of long-term change for all the people \nwho make H&M's products. Meanwhile, we are confident that our presence in Cambodia and other \nproducing countries has a positive effect. By being present in the production countries, reach agreements \ntogether with manufacturers and evaluate our own part, we can slowly but surely contribute to lasting \nimprovements. \n\nWe take a positive view on wage increases and we want suppliers to pay their employees a fair living \nwage. As mentioned in the report, we have developed a Fair Living Wage strategy that involves not only \nbuyers but also suppliers, factory employees and governments. It has been drawn up in consultation with \nglobal trade unions, suppliers and non-profit organizations. Our approach is that wages should be \nnegotiated between the parties on the labour market. Our initial goal is that all our strategic suppliers \nshould have pay structures allowing fair living wages in place by 2018. Implementation and scaling up is \nprogressing with 68 factories during 2015 and additional 80 factories during 2016. \n\nAccording to the ILO and global unions, there is no universal benchmark on how to calculate a living \nwage. Instead, they stress the importance of promoting freedom of association and collective bargaining \nas necessary for workers and employers to negotiate wages and conditions of work. We share this view \nand that is why we focus on improved industrial relations rather than setting a certain wage living wage \nlevel. \n\nHowever, as we are well aware that the opportunities for employees to negotiate are limited in many \ncountries, we are involved in projects and programs aiming for a strengthening of employees’ rights and \ntheir ability to negotiate through trade unions or other elected employee representatives. We are running \nindustrial relations and social dialogue projects in place in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India and \nEthiopia. In 2016 we will also start the same projects in Myanmar.  \n\nIn Cambodia, we contribute to industrial relations with training in for example negotiation and conflict \nmanagement together with ILO, the Swedish trade union IF Metall and SIDA. The customised training \nprogrammes consist of workplace cooperation, labour law and dispute resolution, effective \ncommunication and negotiation skill with the aim to build trust and stronger relations between workers \nand management. During 2015, amongst others 1,213 union representatives and 1,030 factory managers \nhave completed the industrial relation training and all participating factories and their trade union \nrepresentatives have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on improving industrial relations as well as \nan agreement to eliminate unfair labour practices.  \n\nCollaboration is crucial to achieve real change and that is also why H&M is collaborating with different \nparties in the textile industry. We work together with our suppliers but also with local and global trade \nunions and governments. Together with other brands and the global trade union IndustriALL, we work on \na strategy to improve wages in the garment industry. H&M has also signed a General Framework \nAgreement with IndustriALL aiming for a well-functioning dialogue between the employer and the \nemployee at the supplier factories that work with H&M. The GFA is highly relevant for Cambodia given the \nnumerous and active trade unions there, and our investment and involvement in improving industrial \nrelations in the country. The GFA supports H&M’s already existing work to promote freedom of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fassociation, collective bargaining and peaceful conflict solution in all the countries where we have \nsuppliers.  \n\nBesides from collaboration, we also believe transparency is a key catalyst of positive change. Therefore, \nwe have published our supplier list and we constantly keep track of where our products are being \nproduced. In this way we can focus our sustainability program and continuously improve the working \nconditions for the 1.6 million workers who are employed by our suppliers. We also publish our \nsustainability result in our yearly published Sustainability Report. \n\nOur goal is for all employees in the textile industry to earn a fair living wage, however; development takes \ntime. We want to further accelerate our work, but we must be patient since it is a complex issue that \naffects not only the suppliers we work with, but also other actors. Raising wages in the textile industry is a \nshared responsibility involving a number of stakeholders with which we have continuous dialogue with.  \n\nFor further information about our Fair Living Wage roadmap, please visit: \nFair Living Wage Roadmap on the H&M webpage \nFair Living Wage roadmap, Half-year update \n\nFor further information about our sustainability program, please visit http://www.hm.com/sustainability"}

This response forms part of an ongoing dialogue that commenced with Bread\nfor All in April 2012 and more recently with RAID in 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, Bread for All and RAID were able to tour our operations in the DRC\nand areas that were of specific interest to the NGOs. Detailed meetings were also\nheld with the senior management teams at both KCC and MUMI. At no point was any\ninformation concealed from either NGO.\n\nThroughout the visit, we were frank and open in our description of the current\nsituation and the challenges we face, as well as our plans for the future. We also\nemphasised our interest in a constructive and informed partnership, and requested\nspecific suggestions for improvement on various aspects of our approach to the\nmanagement of community and environmental issues.\n\nGlencore’s operations in the DRC\n\nGlencore is a substantial investor in the DRC. Katanga Mining and Mutanda between\nthem represent an investment of over $3.7 billion at the end of 2013. This will reach\nc.$4.2 billion at the end of 2014.\n\nThis investment does many things which Glencore believes are positive contributions\nto the DRC. These include creating 17,000 good quality, stable employee and\ncontractor jobs at two operations. 95% of these jobs are held by Congolese\nnationals. In addition the Katanga Mining and Mutanda operations support local\nbusinesses, provide substantial revenues to the DRC’s local, provincial and national\nGovemments and contribute to the development of DRC infrastructure, such as\nroads, bridges and power generation. We also provide microfinance to local\nentrepreneurs to stimulate the economy, and make voluntary contributions to various\nprojects such as renovating/building schools and hospitals to improve living\nstandards in the local communities. To date, the following projects have been\nsupported by KCC and MUMI:\n\ne Education: fourteen primary schools, four technical institutes and one\nuniversity;\n\ne Healthcare: fifteen health centres and five hospitals;\n\ne Transport: construction of Kolwezi airport, paving of local roads and\nconstruction of the bridge over Lualaba River;\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

In 2010, Glencore commissioned detailed engineering studies, and\nin 2012 began implementing the recommendations, including the construction of the\nMupine basin to capture effluent from the operation and prevent it from leaking into\nthe Luilu river.\n\nThe Mupine basin required technical upgrades and rehabilitation works to ensure that\neffluents discharged were in in line with national and international requirements for\nenvironment and groundwater sustainability.\n\nWater Management Measures:\nPart of Phase IV of the refurbishment of Luilu was the development of the\n\nneutralisation system. The project started in August 2011 and ended in February\n2012, at early stage of Phase IV.

Mr. Mutombo was then driven to the KCC hospital by the team composed by\nKCC and G4S officers. It should be noted that the deployment of Mine Police officers\non site is done so by the State to protect their interests. The Mine Police are not\ncontracted out or subordinated to the mines and hence remain outside of the control\nof the mining companies.\n\nWe refute any allegation of having obstructed the investigations. From the start, KCC\nprovided active support and collaborated with investigating authorities to understand\nthe dynamic of the incident and assess whether a violation of human rights occurred.\nAs part of the investigation, KCC provided the death certificate to the investigating\nauthorities at their request. Investigating authorities also requested and obtained\nKCC support to conduct cross-interviews with KCC and contractors’ staff and site\nvisits. While under investigation, the contractors and employees were suspended;\nthis is a standard administrative procedure and does not imply any responsibility or\nguilt. Following the conclusion of the investigation, no charges were advanced\nagainst KCC and contractors’ staff by investigating authorities. The investigation by\nthe military authorities is ongoing and KCC cannot comment on this process, nor\ninterfere with it in any way; this has also been communicated to the relevant\nauthorities in the DRC.\n\nFollowing the Prosecutor's investigation, an intemal Human Rights committee was\nset up to assess whether KCC and contractors’ staff operated in line with company\npolicies and procedures on human rights and security operations. The committee\nwas composed by representatives of the legal department and company Human\nRights Advisor: we interviewed all the staff that took part to the operation directly\n(KCC and contractors’ security staff) and indirectly (dispatch and hospital staff).\nInterviews were conducted in the local language.\n\nThe final assessment of the committee concluded that KCC and G4S staff operated\nin line with company policies and did not infringe human rights. Releasing the results\nof the investigation would infringe on privacy laws, and potentially endanger the\nindividuals involved.\n\nKCC has not been contacted by the legal representatives of the family of Mr.\nMutombo. KCC categorically rejects any allegation or rumour of having directly or\nindirectly encouraged a monetary compensation to the family of Mr. Mutombo.\n\nRegarding the interaction of our operations with the Mine Police, KCC and MUMI are\ncurrently drafting a Memorandum of Understanding with the Mine Police, which will\naddress material and financial assistance, as well as stipulate expected standards of\nconduct.\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

The evacuation was conducted in compliance with DRC law, including a\nformal communication to the local authorities and the SAESSCAM, the artisanal\nminers’ representative body. SAESSCAM also engaged with the miners to alert\nthem to the operation. The evacuation was conducted peacefully. Mine police was\ndeployed only for access control in that specific occasion and KCC did not receive\nany complaint regarding any excessive use of force.\n\nKCC was neither informed nor involved in any incidents that may have occurred in\nKapata, which is located outside of the KCC concession. We cannot comment on\nany other incidents that may have taken place outside of our concession (e.g. at\nMashamba West), or as a result of activities of other mining companies operating in\nthe area.\n\nTilwezembe\n\nAs stated previously, the Tilwezembe concession was illegally seized by artisanal\nminers. The situation at the concession is extremely volatile, and KCC restricts its\nemployees from travelling to the site out of concern for their safety. KCC continues\nto engage with the DRC goverment for a peaceful resolution to this issue.\n\nTrespass and ‘Zero Tolerance’\n\nAs previously stated on several occasions, KCC does not restrict access to\npedestrian roads near its concession. These roads are not the property of KCC but of\nthe State. The only roads with no access are mine specific roads that have been\ndeveloped by KCC since ownership by Glencore. We refute any allegations of abuse\nof pedestrians by KCC security personnel.\n\nAs regards the group of minors, who were found collecting material on our\nconcession on 15th March 2014, our security team did not proceed with an arrest:\ninstead, and in line with our procedures, we interviewed them to be able to identify\nthe families. For those unable to provide any information on the identity of the family,\nKCC informed the Prosecutor, who requested their transfer under his jurisdiction.\nFollowing this transfer, KCC had no authority over the treatment of this group, as it is\nin the jurisdiction of the legal authorities.\n\nSecurity and Human Rights at MUMI\n\nThe tasks and responsibilities of public security officers operating within mining\nconcessions are clearly stipulated by DRC regulation; both companies are in full\ncompliance with this. In accordance with regulation, all public security officers -\nrespond and report to their own hierarchy and chain of command, and do not report\nto KCC or MUMI personnel.\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

In recognition of this constraint, we\nare establishing contacts with MONUSCO, a specialist UN agency based in the DRC\nwho has been granted a mandate by the Government to train public security\nagencies in the country, to develop and implement a reliable, transparent and\ninternationally reputable training programme for public security personnel. In addition\nto this, both KCC and MUMI Security Departments communicate to public security\nagencies and officers our policies and expectations of conduct while on site,\nincluding with regard to the use of force and respect for human rights.\n\nBoth companies are in compliance with DRC regulation with regard to conduct of\narrests, and handling of grievances related to ill treatment or excessive use of force.\nInterviews with the OPJs were conducted during the NGOs’ visit to KC and MUMI.\n\nThe Security Manual is an internal document that guides the conduct of the Security\nDepartments at KCC and MUMI. It contains sensitive information and cannot be\nmade public.\n\nAll internal security personnel go through an induction programme at the beginning of\ntheir employment that includes training on company policies, procedures and\nexpectations, including protocols addressing human rights, such as the Voluntary\nPrinciples and the International Code of Conduct for Security Providers. Personnel\nalso attend annual mandatory ‘refreshment sessions’, conducted either by OPJs or\nsupervisors. Requirement to respect and comply with the Voluntary Principles and\nthe UN Declaration on Human Rights is stated in engagement contracts, and a\nmonitoring system is in place. During the next contract review, both companies will\naddress alignment with the International Code of Conduct for Private Security\nProviders. Finally, a grievance mechanism is in place to report and respond to\npossible infringements of human rights.\n\nAll training and contractual requirements are developed in alignment with Glencore’s\napproach to human rights, as stated in its Code of Conduct, and its commitment to\nimplement the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.\n\nMUMI operates in line with DRC requirements for holding suspects. All suspects are\ntransferred to Kolwezi, where their cases are investigated by the Prosecutor in\naccordance with DRC regulation. All hearings and transfers are supervised by the\nOPJs, who report in this capacity to the Prosecutor, in accordance with DRC\nregulation. MUMI does not employ any members of Agence Nationale de\nRenseignement (ANR).\n\nAccording to DRC mining legislation, site facilities for the storage of explosive and\nblasting material must be supervised by the military.\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

The following mechanisms are in place at KCC and MUMI:\n\n- Dedicated community liaison officers engage with all communities impacted\nby our activities on a daily basis to address concerns and provide updates on\nrelevant operational developments. Minutes are kept of all the meetings;\n\n- Grievance mechanisms are in place to enable community members to\nregister complaints. These are reported and reviewed by senior\nmanagement. Complainants are provided with information on any follow-up\nactions taken\n\n- Regular meetings with elected representatives of the communities, including\ntribal chiefs, to identify the needs of the communities and determine optimal\nsolutions.\n\nAll exchanges with the community are documented and classified as follows:\n\n- Complaints: concerns raised with regard to the negative impacts directly\nlinked to our operations and exploitation, such as dust, noise, odour, traffic,\nincidents involving company vehicles and communities, etc.\n\n- Requests: issues and concerns not directly linked to our operations, such as\nrequests for social assistance, water supply, rehabilitation and construction of\neducation and health facilities, etc.\n\nAll exchanges are documented, reported to senior management and addressed.\nCommunity Liaison Officers\n\nKCC and MUMI reject any allegations regarding the role and involvement of\nauthorities in suppressing complaints and requests from communities; however, as\nmost of community concerns regard access to basic services and infrastructure, such\nas water, education and health, the involvement of authorities is fundamental to\nensure the accountability and the sustainability of our responses.\n\nCommunity Liaison Officers form a core component of our community engagement\nstrategy. Each officer plans weekly meetings and consultations with the reference\ncommunity (i.e. committees, associations and cooperatives, vulnerable groups, etc..)\nwith the aim to report and address community concems and requests to senior\nmanagement. In 2013, 900 meetings were held with the local community\nrepresentatives to address complaints and requests. These included meetings with\ncommunity committees, associations, population living in specific sections of the\ncommunity, customary and local authorities, as well as open information sessions.\n\nGlencore has had no opportunity to review the details of the community feedback to\nthe NGOs as referred to in this report, and so can make no further comments.\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

Projects are\ntargeted to improve both the living conditions and livelihoods of the local communities\nby providing infrastructure which will provide sustainable support to these\ncommunities. These include public roads, airports and other large-scale projects that\nbenefit the local population and promote trade and other development. To date, the\nfollowing projects have been supported by KCC and MUMI:\n\n- Education: fourteen primary schools, four technical institutes and one\nuniversity\n\n- Healthcare: fifteen health centres and five hospitals\n\n- Infrastructure: construction of Kolwezi airport, paving of local roads and\nconstruction of the bridge over Lualaba River.\n\n- Agriculture & Water: 30 local agriculture cooperatives and support to small\nentrepreneurs and local procurement (cleaning campaign, reforestation\ncampaign, wood recycling)\n\nThese projects provide services for the whole population of Kolwezi, i.e.\napproximately one million people.\n\nRights to water and other livelihood issues\n\nGlencore refutes all allegations that it manipulates DRC regulation to suit its\ninterests. The joint venture agreement with Gecamines stipulated the rights and\nobligations of each company, as well as documenting Gecamines’ environmental\nliabilities as a result of it operating KCC prior to KML / Nikanor’s obtaining ownership\nof the sites. This joint venture agreement was subject to the Mining licence review\nand was ultimately approved by the President of the DRC. KCC has taken full\nresponsibility for any impacts its operations have had on the environment and the\nlocal communities since 2009. Its management of these impacts is regularly reviewed\nby the relevant authorities.\n\nWater supply investments\n\nIn accordance with DRC regulation, water supply and delivery is the responsibility of\nthe State, and managed by state entities REGIDESO and SNEL.  Glencore\nrecognises the constraints faced by these organisations, and seeks to assist in water\ndelivery, as well as supplementing existing programmes with its own projects.\n\nState-managed water supply: investments in water supply infrastructure are decided\nand managed through the Kolwezi committee for water supply. This committee is\nchaired by the mayor and involves several partners, including GCM, REGIDESO,\nSNEL and KCC.

In 2013, the committee has started assessing the\nfeasibility of a water supply project for the community of Luilu.\n\nKCC water projects: KCC has constructed 14 manual bore wells in various\nsurrounding communities and supports the community in managing the facility in an\nefficient and transparent way. Until these were completed, and subsequently during\nany interruptions of water supply, KCC provided water to local communities using\nwater trucks.\n\nWater management at Musonoi: water supply at Musonoi is ensured by a pump\nmanaged by Gecamines in accordance with REGIDESO. While KCC has no control\nover the use of this pump, we have, on request, provided technical and financial\nassistance for its maintenance.\n\nWater management at Luilu: KCC drilled hand pumps in Luilu to facilitate access to\nwater in 2011-2012, and will also be providing tanks for water purification in the area.\nFollowing the completion of the Mutoshi project, REGIDESO will focus on water\nneeds of Luilu. KCC will provide support to this project.\n\nRural Communities\n\nSome of the roads used by communities are within MUMI concession. As our\noperations expanded further onto the MUMI concessions, we needed to ensure the\nsafety of pedestrians and avoid any possible incident due to the circulation of trucks\nand other vehicles. This was conducted in consultation with community members.\nWe have already built alternative roads and we are currently in the process of\nassessing the feasibility of additional measures (i.e. shorter routes, transport, etc..).\n\nWe have ensured that surrounding communities continue to have access to timely\nmedical care. Medical facilities have been installed by MUMI on both sides of the\nNational road and we developed a partnership with Lualaba Health zone to assist in\nparticular cases and emergencies. It should be noted that all healthcare available in\nthe area has been funded and supported by MUMI, as pre-existing infrastructure was\ninadequate. Since beginning operations, MUMI has established the following\ninitiatives:\n\n- Health clinic in Kando, servicing 45 people per day\n\n- Pediatric programme for children under five years old, (vaccination, periodic\ncontrols, targeting malaria\n\n- New project with Lualaba Health Zone to establish a fully-equipped hospital in\nthe area\n\n- Medication donations to Lualaba Health Zone (in progress)\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

Since 2009, the mine plan has been fully revised, and now consists of an\nunderground mine expansion moving in the opposite direction from Musonoi. Given\nthe fundamental change in the mine plan, the original RAP was not disclosed to\navoid confusion. Likely impacts of the new mine plan are currently under review as\npart of the ongoing ESIA process.\n\nIn line with DRC mining legislation, following the completion of the ESIA review, we\nwill conduct a second round of consultations to inform affected communities of\noperational impacts and prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nDRC mining legislation stipulates precise standards for vibrations and sound during\nblasting. In line with international standards, such as the US Bureau of Mines and US\nOffice of Surface Mining, the thresholds fixed by DRC are 12.5 mm/sec for vibration\nand 120 dB for sound. KCC operates in line with the DRC and international\nstandards: we monitor our performance through seismographs, set up in different\nlocations within and nearby our concession. Blasting sessions and vibrations reports\nare periodically reviewed by competent local bodies from the Ministry of Mines.\n\nIV) Fiscal Issues\n\nWe refute any allegation that there has been a transfer of profits to avoid paying\ntaxes in the DRC.\n\nAll taxes are paid to the DRC State and State companies in accordance with the laws\nof the country, the Mining Code and the Joint Venture Agreement signed between\nKML and Gecamines.\n\nIn addition to the minimum cash taxes payable by MUMI and KCC, the operations\npay taxes relating to imports, exports, royalties, IPR, IERE, INSS, INPP, IM, IBO,\ndroits superficiaries et autres (DGRAD) the total of which amounted to US$ 212\nmillion and US$ 282 million for 2012 and 2013 respectively\n\nWe are aware of a report by the public prosecutor regarding outstanding taxes and\npenalties that MUMI has not paid. Contrary to what is stated in the report, no contact\nwas made with MUMI to discuss these findings and no claim has ever been lodged.\n\nKCC’s accounts are subject to the accounting principles in force in the DRC; KCC is\naudited annually by Deloitte (in the past KPMG) and the Gecamines internal statutory\nauditor. The accounts of KCC are signed off annually by the Board of Directors which\nincludes Gecamines representatives in accordance with the JVA.\n\nThe going concern of the company is assessed each year in accordance with\naccounting standards and KCC continues to show that shows sufficient liquidity to\npay all creditors with the support by Glencore.\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

Glencore is required under\nTSX and standard operating procedures to excuse itself from any vote relating to\nrelated party transactions. In addition, KML’s independent directors appointed an\nindependent financial advisor to comment on the commercial terms of the Glencore\nloan facility, which found the terms to be fair and reasonable. The original loans from\nKML to KCC (prior to Glencore’s involvement) reflect market terms at the time of the\ntransaction. This was evident by the KML debenture facility which was issued with a\nyield of 14%.\n\nIt should be noted that Glencore entered into the offtake agreements with Nikanor\nand KML separately when KCC was still made up of two companies. At the time of\nentering the contracts, Glencore was a minority shareholder in Nikanor and its only\ninvestment in KML was through the issuance of a convertible loan (no ownership at\nthe time). These off-take facilities were signed by each company’s respective boards.\nAt the time of the merger of the companies, as the off-takes were with the respective\nDRC entities and as such Gecamines was required to approve the agreements.\n\nThe Glencore offtake facilities are disclosed publically on SEDAR in accordance with\nTSX requirements.\n\nKCC has appointed external experts to perform transfer pricing studies regarding\nservices offered to KCC, the conclusion of such reports is that the interest rates and\nmargins for these services are reasonable and aligned with OECD guidelines on\ntransfer pricing.\n\nGlencore continues to support KML and KCC as we believe in the operations and\nbelieve that liquidating the company would have dire impacts on the DRC including\nthe loss of some 10’000 jobs in Kolwezi.\n\nIn 2012, the DRC Finance Minister commissioned Ernst & Young to perform a full\nverification audit on the fixed assets of KCC dating back to 2008 over and above and\nwithout any reference at all to the annual audits performed by KCC and KML’s\nextemal independent financial auditors. KCC received the auditors on site initially to\ndiscuss the plan and documentation requested. Due to the volume of information\nrequested, KCC formally requested additional time for compilation. The auditors\nsubsequently returned and were welcomed by KCC in July 2013 to perform their\naudit. An interim audit report was released in November 2013 which was discussed\nand reviewed in conjunction with the KCC audit team. Since then no further\nresponses have been received from these auditors. KCC has requested the final\naudit report but has not yet received a copy.\n\nAll related party transactions are disclosed in the KML reports, including those\ninvolving contractors, In addition to the related party contracts, significant contractors\n\nGlencore ple\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

Under this agreement, Gecamines has the right to\naudit the royalty payments, and has found no discrepancies. In addition, and outside\nof the joint venture agreement in respect of KCC, KCC pays ‘redevance miniére’\n(state royalty) to the State, which is calculated at 2% of net income in accordance\nwith the Mining Code.\n\nGlencore has endorsed the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative as part of its\nsupport for increased transparency of the redistribution and reinvestment of taxes\nand royalty payments into the communities in which we operate.\n\nBoth KCC and MUMI have completed all submissions for the EITI process in the\nDRC and submitted them in accordance with the process. In recent years, this has\nbeen via submissions to KPMG who were mandated by the DRC State to act as an\nindependent auditor charged with reconciling the payments made by the companies\nand the receipts from the State. KPMG issued signed certificates based on all\nsubmissions.\n\nWe are aware that discrepancies were identified between the reports submitted by\nour operations and the receipts of the government. We fully cooperated to resolve\nthese issues before the release of the final report. We are still open to any\ndiscussions regarding these discrepancies and would be happy to show proof of all\npayments to KPMG to resolve any outstanding issues.\n\nMUMI and KANSUKI Merger and Glencore Xstrata’s share acquisition\n\nAt the time when Gecamines sold it stakes in Mutanda and Kansuki, Glencore held\n40% of Mutanda through Samref Congo and 37.5% of Kansuki through Kansuki\nInvestments Sprl respectively.\n\nIt is important to note that Glencore did not have the pre-emptive option but rather\nSamref Congo and Kansuki Investments Sprl. The management of these companies\nwere subject to joint venture agreements which included clauses requiring both\nshareholders to approve certain transactions. The pre-emptive option was one such\ntransaction.\n\nIn addition, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholding in DRC\nprojects. This was for two reasons; firstly Glencore already had substantial capital\ncommitments to develop Katanga and Mutanda and preferred to invest its funds in\ndeveloping its DRC projects — i.e. in expanding mine infrastructure — rather than\npaying out shareholders. Secondly Glencore perceived that there was potentially\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

The outcome was\nuncertain and it was possible that there could be very unfavourable implications for\nthe mining industry.\n\nSamref and Kansuki therefore decided they were not willing to match the other bids\non the table. The recommendation back to Gecamines was to follow the highest bid.\n\nAny details regarding the transaction between the Fleurette Group and Gecamines\nshould: be discussed with these two companies as none of our operations were party\nto the transaction.\n\nRegarding further increases in our stake in Mutanda, the situation today for Glencore\nis different, with the Mutanda and Katanga operations at a more advanced state of\ndevelopment and with the presidential elections now complete. In addition, the\nsubsequent merger of Glencore and Xstrata has given the company greater scale,\nwhich will enable more investment in the DRC whilst maintaining a balanced portfolio\nworldwide.\n\nTaxes and penalties paid in 2013\n\nAll taxes and penalties have been disclosed in KML’s annual financial statements.\nThe first related to the interpretation of an export tariff code. Where KCC discussed\nwith the export authorities which code the copper nodules need to be exported under.\nAll discussions were minuted with the tax authorities and it was agreed that pending\na technical review by a competent authority, KCC would continue to export nodules\nunder one of the codes and that in the event that an alternative code was required;\nKCC would make the necessary declaration adjustment.\n\nSubsequent to the technical review, the adjustment was required and the tax\nauthorities levied penalties on the transactions.\n\nAll expatriates working formally for KCC are employed by KCC. Prior to Glencore’s\nownership, certain expatriates were appointed by KCC under the Foreign Technical\nAssistance laws of the DRC. In 2012/2013 KCC’s management decided to bring all\nexpatriates onto the payroll and the Technical Service Agreement was terminated.\nKCC made this change of its own accord.\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

We have a 'hands on' approach to \nsustainability and the joint work that Inditex maintains with the international trade union \nIndustriALL, by means of the Global Framework Agreement signed in 2007, is a crucial \npart  of  this.  This  agreement  protects  the  interests  of  all  workers  involved  directly  or \nindirectly  in  the  set  of  activities  developed  by  Inditex,  establishing  better  standards  in \nmatters of trade union rights, health, safety and environmental practices, among others. \nWe would be happy to share more details of this, should it be of interest at any point. \n\nBefore  specifically  comment  regarding  the  Facing  Finance  article,  there  are  some \nconcerns  with  the  report  which  we  think  it  is  important  that  you  are  aware  of  and \nunderstand. \n\nMisleading contents of the Facing Finance article \n1. We thought it important to highlight that Facing Finance did not contact us at any point \nin  the  compilation  of  their  report.  As  such,  it  includes  some  factual  errors  and \ninconsistencies which we detail accordingly below.  \n\n2. Importantly, the report notes ‘Inditex (Zara) has also been implicated in forced labour in \nsweatshops in Argentina’ with a reference to an Al  Jazeera article. This is incorrect. It \nrefers to an instance when La Alameda, an Argentinian NGO denounced the existence of \nthree irregular workshops supposedly sourcing several brands, including Zara. In fact, this \n\n \n \n \n \n\faccusation is completely untrue, as the Court in Buenos Aires has definitely proved and \nconfirmed in one sentence. \n\n3. The content of the report also incorrectly describes Inditex’s ‘proximity model’ where it \nsays  ‘meaning  production  takes  place  close  to  the  brand’s  consumer  markets’  and \ndescribes this as the reason for Inditex’s proportion of sourced products in Brazil. In fact \nour ‘proximity sourcing model’ refers to the fact that 60% of Inditex’s production takes \nplace in or close to its distribution centres in Spain. Less than 35% of products sold \nby  Zara  Brasil  are  made  in  Brazil  which  in  fact  represents  less  than  1%  of  global \nmanufacturing for Inditex. \n\n4. In the Facing Finance report’s methodology it included companies with a focus on recent \nevents (to include events in the previous three years). It does not happen in the Inditex \npage.  We  note  that  a  large  part  of  the  report’s  section  on  Inditex  is  related  to  a  case \ninvolving a supplier of Inditex which occurred back in 2011, five years ago. This does not \nreflect the current picture of Brazil’s supply chain. Actually, there have been several \ninitiatives that no other company has taken in the supervision of the supply chain and in \noffering  customers  specific  details  of  the  suppliers’  performance.  Some  of  them  are \nmentioned below.  \n\nThe Facing Finance story raises a number of points, so we hope to build understanding \nby commenting on each specifically.  \n\nConfirmed facts of Inditex Responsible Performance \nA) Actual initiatives taken in Brazil. We note that a large portion of the section on Inditex \nwas  lifted  verbatim  out  of  the  SOMO  Reporter  Brazil  (May,  2015)  (‘From  moral \nresponsibility to legal liability? http://www.somo.nl/’). Yet Facing Finance’s report focused \non  the  historical  background  section  of  this  SOMO  report,  but  missed  details  of  the \nsignificant efforts carried out by Inditex since 2012 to guarantee the correct performance \nin terms of labour rights in the Brazilian companies that manufacture its products.  \n\nWe kindly ask you to review the conclusions of the report itself on page 55 of the SOMO \n(http://www.somo.nl/publications-\nreport \nn/Publication_4188/picture/image_view_fullscreen) \nthough  we  can  also  provide  a \nsummary of the actions Inditex has taken in Brazil here: \n\n• \nSince  2011,  Inditex  has  reported  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of \ninspections  performed  at  its  Brazilian  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  either  by  the \n\n \n\fcompany’s own staff or by outside consultants. To be exact, since 2012, Inditex has \ncarried  out  more  than  2,800  audits  to  the  Brazilian  companies  that  manufacture  its \nproducts,  supported  by  the  most  demanding  international  procedures  based  on  our \nFramework  Agreement  with  the  Global  Federation  of  Unions  (IndustriALL,  which \nrepresents  50  million  workers  in  144  Countries)  and  performed  by  prestigious \ninternational and independent agencies as Intertek, SGS and Apcer. Inditex can firmly \nguarantee  the  correct  performance  of  this  Brazilian  supply  chain  in  terms  of  labour \nstandards. \n\nNot  only  did  the  company  increase  the  number  of  audits,  it  also  strengthened  its \nmonitoring mechanisms, in cooperation with the Brazilian Textile, Garment, Leather and \nFootwear Workers’ Federation. \n\n• \nInditex undertook efforts to stimulate suppliers’ compliance with the Inditex code of \nconduct  by  creating  a  good  practices  manual  for  suppliers;  by  adopting  a  social \ncompliance  certification  scheme;  and  by  implementing  pilot  projects  at  suppliers  in \ncooperation with UNIETHOS. \n\nTogether with Brazilian civil society organizations, the company has also promoted \n• \ninvestments in immigrant communities’ projects. The results of which can so far be \nsummarized as so:  \n\n-  Creation  of  an  Emergency  Fund  which  has  helped  over  40,000  people. \n-  10,000  people  attended  in  the  effort  to  support  the  documentation  of  migrant \nworkers. \n- 90,000 participants in various activities designed to help vulnerable immigrants \nand youths. \n-  Professional  training  projects  in  the  garment  sector  and  related  activities. \n- Funding for the creation of the CIC, which is expected to benefit 1,000 immigrants \neach  day.  The  institution  supports  the  regularization  of  their  migratory  situation \npromoting vocational training. \n-  Overall investment in community projects of over BRL14 million.  \n-  In  this  same line,  Inditex has  collaborated closely with  renowned NGOs  on this \ntask, including CDHIC, CAMI and Missão Paz.  \n\nZara Brasil announced in May 2014 the launch of the ‘Manufactured in Brazil’ \n• \n(‘Fabricado no Brasil’) initiative. All the labels of garments made in the country have \na QR code to allow full access to information about the manufacturing details of each \n\n \n\fand every garment, including social and working conditions across the production line. \nThis is a radical and unprecedented initiative to open up our supply chain in Brazil. We \nbelieve  this  is  a  sign  of  our  commitment  to  improving  conditions,  which  we  believe \nsurpasses that of our peers. \n\n• \nZara  Brasil’s  complaints  hotline  was  significantly  strengthened  when  the \ncompany outsourced the operation of the service to the Center for Human Rights and \nImmigrant  Citizenship  (CDHIC),  thereby  providing  an  avenue  for  “legal  and  social \nreferrals of accounts by immigrants of any nationality who want[ed] to report cases of \ndiscrimination and/or working conditions analogous to slavery”. \n\nB)  Legal defense. The Facing  Finance  report  also  referenced the  pending  legal  case \nbetween Zara Brasil and the Brazilian authorities regarding the Cadastro (so called dirty \nlist) instigated in 2012, stating ‘Zara’s irresponsible legal strategy undermines Brazilian \nefforts to eradicate modern-day slavery’. We refute this statement. We viewed this case \nas an administrative process and as a democratic right to defend the company's reputation \nof what it understands as an unfair decision that in no way impacted Inditex’ continued \neffort to improve working conditions in Brazil. Inditex continues to amply demonstrate its \ncommitment to fighting for better social and labour conditions.  \n\nImportantly, it is worth highlighting that the Cadastro was suspended in December 2014 \nby  the  Federal  Court  of  Justice  (Supremo  Tribunal  Federal)  of  Brazil  because  of  the \nconstitutional claim filed by an entrepreneur organization, as such, it does not now legally \nworks. And to be sure, Zara Brasil has also never been included in it. \n\nC) Untrue picture of the supply chain. Finally, the Facing Finance report also references \na  report by  the Brazilian  Labour  ministry  which  alleged  that  7,000 workers  were badly \ntreated since 2012. We should highlight that this is an unfair accusation as none of these \nalleged  violations  were  regarding  human  rights  issues  or  modern  slavery.  First  of  all, \nInditex is one of many Brazilian brands producing in those Brazilian factories. Then, most \nof  the  alleged  violations  were  minor  administrative  infringements  such  as  adequate \nseating in staff rooms, that took place two or three years ago (they were recovered in 2015 \nfrom files from between 2012 and 2014) and many of which have been identified through \nInditex' own audits and consequently resolved. \n\nIt is important to highlight that, in any case, during all of that time, the Labour ministry did \nnot once notify Zara Brasil of any irregularities. It is surprising that in many of these cases \ncompanies inspected by the Regional Department of Employment also were not notified. \n\n\fAs a result, this could have prevented steps from being taken to correct issues, should \nthey  not  have  been  picked  up  by  our  own  audits.  This  is  an  important  point,  since \naccording to the Good Conduct Undertaking (TAC) signed on 19 December 2011 Inditex \nshould have been notified of these violations immediately after being found, so they could \nbe corrected within ten days.  \n\nThis also seemed to be a major contradiction implied by denouncing violations in Brazilian \ntextile  business’s  facilities  yet  not  taking  any immediate  corrective action  to  ensure  an \nimprovement in employment conditions.  \n\nAnd, as we have mentioned, it is also worth pointing out that the Labour ministry only \nnamed Zara Brasil in this report, in spite of the fact that Zara Brasil accounted for less than \n15% of the total production of suppliers named.  \n\nThis report is currently under discussion with the Brazilian authorities. \n\nTo summarize regarding Brazil, we also think it useful to include comments from Jyrki \nRaina,  General  Secretary  of  the  IndustriALL  Global  Union,  regarding  Inditex’s  supply \nchain  in  Brazil.  IndustriALL,  as  you  know,  represents  over  50  million  workers  in  142 \ncountries,  including  the  members  of  Brazil’s  garment  sector  union  Sindicato  das \nCostureiras, and fights tirelessly to improve working conditions worldwide. He notes that \n\"a number of joint missions that have been carried out by IndustriALL affiliates and Inditex \nrepresentatives to make improvements in Brazilian factories\", and adds that \"Inditex has \ndeveloped robust systems to prevent, control and remediate potential breaches of \nthe GFA and the company's Code of Conduct [...] Their main objective is to protect and \nstrengthen  workers'  rights  while  training  the  management  and  workers  to  achieve  a \ncommon understanding\". \"With committed partners such as Inditex we are definitely on \nthe right path for ensuring sustainable conditions  of work throughout the global supply \nchain\". \n\nD) Misleading mention to Pull & Bear. Finally, the Facing Finance report referenced \nirregularities found by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights at a factory in \nBangladesh supplying to Pull&Bear. This case is precisely the opposite of what the article \nintends to say. It is actually an example of how the Sustainability Team works at Inditex \nand how to react with a supplier, helping them to reach the best practices.  \n\nThis case is brilliantly summarized in the following article by the Institute for Global Labour \nand  Human Rights:  http://www.globallabourrights.org/alerts/bangladesh-unprecedented-\nturnaround-at-jeans-plus-factory. \n\n\fTo briefly summarize the case, the action taken by Inditex allowed to confirm that: \n\n- Jeans Plus management guarantees that all workers receive their Friday holiday off each \nweek. \n\n- Factory remains open no later than 7:00 p.m. (50% of the workers were released at 5:00 \np.m., while the other 50% worked work until 7:00.) \n\n- Pregnant women workers receive their full maternity benefits. \n\n- All workers receive legal sick leave and earn leave benefits. \n\n- Jeans Plus management guarantees full compliance with all Bangladeshi labor laws. \n\n- Mid-level managers and supervisors were instructed to assure an appropriate treatment \nto workers decently.  \n\nWe highly appreciated the commitment of both the management with the implementation \nof  this  measure  and  the  NGO  Global  Labour  and  Human  Rights  which  has  actively \nfollowed the issue. These fast actions were acknowledged and commended by the IGLHR \nand do feel free to contact them directly should there be any doubts.  \n\nFrom  Inditex’  perspective,  this  is  one  of  the  many  cases  of  the  never-ending  task  to \nguarantee the sustainability in the supply chain, always looking at the medium and long \nterm period. \n\nThank  you  indeed  for  getting  in  touch  for  comment  and  if  you  would  like  any  further \ninformation, or to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to let us know. We keep at \nyour disposal for any further information or clarification required. \n\nBest wishes, \n\nInditex External Relations."}

This programme helps us assess and \naddress labour and human rights issues – including those raised in the latest report of Facing \nFinance – across our value chain in an ongoing manner. Other issues raised in this report are \naddressed through our policies, procedures and commitments to product safety and quality, \nwater stewardship and environmental sustainability. \n\nForced  labour  and  other  human  rights  abuses  have  no  place  in  our  supply  chain.  We  are \ncommitted to eliminating them in the seafood supply chain in Thailand, working alongside others. \nOur mandatory Nestlé Supplier Code and Responsible Sourcing Guideline (RSG) on Fish and \nSeafood require all of our suppliers to respect human rights and to comply with all applicable \nlabour laws. \n\nNestlé’s  NGO  partner  Verité  spent  three  months  in  2015  collecting  information  from  fishing \nvessels, ports, mills and farms to identify where and why forced labour and human rights abuses \nmay be taking place in Thailand. Using the recommendations provided, we published an action \nplan  in  late  2015  for  preventing  unacceptable  practices.  We  also  made  Verité’s  key  findings \npublically available to help wider efforts to stop abuses from taking place.  \n\nWe have made significant progress in implementing our action plan, alongside Vérité, suppliers \nand in partnership with the Government of Thailand.  This includes establishing traceability for \n99% of our seafood supplied from Thailand, a vital step towards verifying employment, living and \nworking conditions on the vessels  used in our supply chain. Progress has also been made in \nproviding training for boat workers, establishing a grievance mechanism for reporting abuses and \nin  funding  a  demonstration  boat  for  training  and  sharing  best  practice  among  boat  owners, \ncaptains and workers.   \n\nWe will continue to provide updates on both our achievements and the challenges in implementing \nour plan.  \n\nAlongside  this,  Nestlé  is  participating  in  an  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  Working \nGroup  to  identify  further  ways  of  improving  general  labour  conditions  in  Thailand’s  seafood \nindustry. This group has developed training guidelines for factories, primary processors and fish \nfarms to help end unfair practices, and tools to support the inspection of fishing vessels to identify \nwhere forced and child labour is taking place.  \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn addition, we have recently joined the Shrimp Sustainable Supply Chain Task Force (SSSCTF), \nan international industry alliance including retailers, manufacturers, governments and NGOs. It is \ntasked with ensuring Thailand’s seafood supply chain is free from illegal and forced labour through \naccountability, verification and transparency.  \n\nWe are firmly opposed to all forms of child exploitation. Our Nestlé Supplier Code and Nestlé \nCorporate  Business  Principles  explicitly  cover  child  labour  and  we  are  taking  action  to \nprogressively eliminate it by assessing individual cases and tackling the root causes.  \n\nThese efforts are part of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan, which aims to improve the lives of cocoa farming \ncommunities  and  the  quality  of  the  cocoa  we  purchase.  In  2014,  we  set  up  our  Child  Labour \nRemediation and Monitoring System (CLMRS) in Côte d’Ivoire. This comprehensive mechanism \nis helping us and our partners, including the Fair Labour Association (FLA) to identify children at \nrisk in each cocoa community and the specific conditions that put them at risk. We then, together \nwith  our  partners,  work  with  individual  households  and  the  community  to  raise  awareness, \naddress  and  prevent  the  problem.  In  2015,  the  CLMRS  was  extended  to  a  further  18  co-\noperatives, taking the total to 40, and will cover all 79 Nestlé Cocoa Plan co-operatives by 2016.  \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first cocoa purchaser to set up such a system to tackle \nchild labour. Creating opportunities for children in cocoa growing communities to attend school is \none of the ways known to help reduce the incidence of child labour. To date, Nestlé has built and \nrefurbished 42 schools in communities most at need. These efforts, which have benefitted more \nthan 11,000 children so far, are part of our ongoing long-term commitment to tackle this issue. \nWe are also working to increase monitoring and accountability throughout  the various tiers of  our \nsupply chain.We provide annual updates on our progress in the Nestlé in Society report and on \nour Nestlé Cocoa Plan website.  \n\nWe are determined to eradicate the problem of child labour in our supply chain and we have made \nthis a priority for our company. We also recognise that the elimination of child labour is a shared \nresponsibility and that we are not able to address its root causes alone. However, through the \nCLMRS, we are able to better understand the extent of the problem and are better positioned to \nwork with the government,  NGOs, international organisations, other businesses, suppliers and \nthe  farmer  communities  themselves  to  make  sustained  progress  in  tackling  this  serious  and \ncomplex issue. \n\nAs a company which sources a significant amount of palm oil from Malaysia, we are concerned \nby serious allegations of labour abuses at plantations.  \n\nNestlé does not source from the region named in recent reports, and neither do we purchase \npalm oil from Felda Global Ventures, the company at the centre of the allegations. However, we \ndo have commercial relationships with suppliers which also operate in these areas and, as such, \nare closely monitoring the situation. We welcome commitments from Felda to act on the findings \nof  an  independent  investigation  into  the  allegations,  carried  out  by  Accreditation  Services \nInternational (ASI) on behalf of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Nestlé supports \nefforts  to  improve  transparency  in  the  palm  oil  supply  chain,  and  we  have  worked  with \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\forganisations including The Forest Trust to monitor and assess our suppliers regarding labour \nand  environmental  issues.  We  will  continue  to  work  proactively  with  our  partners  to  improve \npractices in the palm oil industry. \n\nRegarding the reference to Maggi noodles in India. The trust of our consumers and the safety of \nour products are our first priorities across all the markets in which we operate. In India, we have \nbuilt  a  reputation  for  consistently  delivering  products  that  meet  the  highest  quality  and  safety \nstandards  for  the  103  years  we  have  been  in  the  country  and  the  33  years  we  have  been \nproducing Maggi Noodles.  \n\nNestlé India has always maintained that Maggi Noodles are safe for consumption. Unfortunately, \nand in order to avoid consumer confusion, Nestlé India decided to stop selling Maggi noodles in \nthe country. This withdrawal was also carried out to comply with the recall order made by the \nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). We submitted samples of Maggi Noodles \nfrom more than 800 product batches to an external laboratory for independent analysis for lead. \nWe also tested samples from more than 1,850 batches at our own accredited laboratory. All the \nresults  of  these  internal  and  external  tests  showed  that  lead  levels  were  well  within  the  limits \nspecified by food safety regulations and that Maggi Noodles are safe to eat. Nestlé shared these \nresults with the authorities and the results are also available on our website for consumers. \n\nOn 9 November 2015, Maggi Noodles Masala was re-launched and ever since, the market has \nbeen working to reintroduce the full range of product variants on the market. We appreciate the \npositive  consumer  response to the  return  of Maggi Noodles to the market and  are working to \npromptly reintroduce all of its variants. We remain fully committed to working with the authorities \nto resolve the situation and uphold high quality standards in India. \n\nConsumers  choose  to  buy  bottled  water  because  it  provides  convenient,  healthy,  no-calorie \nhydration.  We  support  consumer  choice  and  encourage  the  consumption  of  water,  whether \nbottled or from the tap, as part of a healthy lifestyle. Bottled water does not compete with tap \nwater as the major source of drinking water for any population. It is also an important source of \ndrinking water when tap water infrastructure is temporarily unavailable, such as in the wake of \nnatural  disasters.  Bottled  water  also  leads  other  packaged  beverage  products  with  respect  to \nenvironmental performance.  \n\nNestlé Waters is a comparatively small water user and is fully committed to responsible water \nmanagement. Nestlé’s group-wide Commitment on Water Stewardship guides our efforts. At each \nof our water bottling operations, we constantly monitor our water draws to ensure that we are not \nnegatively  impacting  local  watersheds  and  aquifers.  Nestlé  Waters  has  improved  water  use \nefficiency in its operations by 20% over the last five years and collaborates with other stakeholders \nto help ensure the long-term sustainability of the watersheds in which we operate.  \n\nAccess to water is a basic human right. All people have the right to clean water to meet their \nhydration and basic hygiene needs. Guidance by the World Health Organization and the United \nNations puts this at 50 to 100 litres of water per person per day. We have explicitly incorporated \nthe recognition of and respect for the human right to water into our Nestlé Corporate Business \nPrinciples. In the Nestlé Water Stewardship Commitment, we commit to ensuring that this right is \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\frespected through measures such as diligence processes to evaluate our potential impact on a \ncommunity’s right to water, as well as the long-term availability of water resources. \n\nWe are proud to be recognised as a leading company in addressing the challenges of climate \nchange  along  our  entire  value  chain.  We  are  among  the  two  top  rated  companies  on  climate \nchange  in  Oxfam’s  Behind  the  Brand  Scorecard  and  we  have  retained  our  industry-leading \nposition in the ‘environmental dimension’ of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Series. In 2015, \nNestlé received an A- leadership score by the CDP Water programme and a score of 100 out of \n100 in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index.  \n\nWe know that based on the available evidence, the food and agriculture sectors will be among \nthose most affected by climate change. We have been following the scientific data for many years \nand in 2001, integrated climate change into our company-wide risk management processes. Our \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  reduction  and  disclosure  practices  have  been  consistently \nrecognised as being among the best in the industry as a result of our actions and forward-looking \nstrategy  for  addressing  climate  change  along  the  value  chain  of  our  products.  We  have  set \nourselves  three  new  objectives  to  reinforce  our  efforts  in  reducing  GHG  emissions  in  our \ndistribution operations and in our major warehouses, and using natural refrigerants in our new \nrefrigerated trucks.  \n\nIn 2015 we invested CHF 289 million in replacing synthetic refrigerants with natural alternatives \nin  our  industrial  refrigeration  systems.  We  have  put  our  full  support  behind  important    multi-\nstakeholder initiatives, including the Paris Pledge  for Action, a  universal climate agreement at \nCOP 21 in Paris, the American Business Act on Climate pledge as well as United Nations Global \nCompact’s “Caring for Climate” initiative, the world’s largest global coalition on climate issues. We \nbelieve meaningful progress on addressing the global challenge of climate change can only be \nachieved through comprehensive, multi-stakeholder efforts. We will continue to actively contribute \nto  such  efforts  and  the  global  dialogue  on  this  important  topic,  while  strengthening  our  public \ncommitments along our value chain and driving industry efforts on climate change. \n\n4"}

Nous avons \nconsulté le rapport du Collectif l’Ethique sur l'Etiquette et souhaitons apporter les précisions \nsuivantes. \n\nPour le Groupe adidas, les aspects financiers de sponsoring n'ont aucune incidence sur la gestion et \nla certification des conditions de travail dans notre supply chain. Et contrairement aux affirmations \ndu rapport de l'ONG, nous estimons respecter notre engagement en faisant preuve de responsabilité \ndans l'approvisionnement de nos produits.  \n\nDe notre point de vue, les déclarations du rapport font des généralités. Les pratiques \nd'approvisionnement et les tendances en matière de confection ne sont guère étayées, sont mal \ninformées et sont donc trompeuses. C'est pourquoi nous souhaitons apporter les clarifications \nsuivantes :  \n\n  La Chine reste un pays d'approvisionnement essentiel pour le Groupe adidas ; elle représente \nla plus grande concentration de sites de production pour notre chaîne d'approvisionnement \nmondiale. En plus des exportations, les opérations de confection chinoises sont également \ndestinées à un marché domestique en pleine croissance, dans un pays qui est désormais la \ndeuxième économie mondiale.  \n\n  Les décisions relatives aux passages de commandes sont complexes. Elles ne dépendent pas \nde la localisation d’un fournisseur dans un pays où les salaires sont les plus bas, mais d'un \nensemble de facteurs : la capacité de production disponible, la capacité d'un fournisseur à \nfabriquer un produit donné, les coûts de fonctionnement et les niveaux de productivité, les \navantages commerciaux pour le pays d'origine, l'accès au marché, la logistique ainsi que \nl'accès aux matériaux.  \n\n  La Lean manufacturing, lorsqu'elle est correctement mise en œuvre, offre aux travailleurs la \npossibilité de gagner des salaires plus élevés (par des programmes de bonus et de primes) \ntout en réduisant leurs horaires de travail. Ce système est généralement bénéfique.  \n\n  L'automatisation de certains processus de production aide en effet à gérer l'augmentation des \nfrais de production, mais l'introduction de la robotique et de technologies similaires dans des \npays tels que la Chine n'est pas uniquement motivée par l'augmentation des coûts des \nmatières et des salaires, mais aussi par le manque de main-d'œuvre. En effet, la prochaine \ngénération de demandeurs d'emploi n’aspire pas à travailler dans des usines, mais préfèrerait \ntrouver un poste dans un secteur des services en pleine croissance.  \n\n  La production automatisée de chaussures récemment lancée en Allemagne par le Groupe \nadidas est appelée une « Speed Factory ». Elle est destinée à répondre aux besoins des \nconsommateurs, par la création rapide de produits personnalisés. En fait, elle rapproche la \nproduction du marché local. Il s'agit d'une approche novatrice, mais elle ne saurait remplacer \ndirectement les processus de production de gros volumes existants dans les principaux pays \nexportateurs en Asie.  \n\n \n\nIl est faux d'affirmer que le droit du travail est plus souple ou que les travailleurs n'ont pas la \npossibilité de gagner des salaires décents en dehors de la Chine, où les politiques \ngouvernementales ont entraîné une augmentation progressive des salaires. Au Cambodge par \nexemple, 80 % des fournisseurs partenaires du Groupe adidas disposent de syndicats \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\findépendants. De plus, les salaires des usines de nos fournisseurs sont supérieurs à l'indice \ndu coût de la vie déterminé par les syndicats locaux. En Indonésie, 90 % de nos fournisseurs \nintègrent un ou plusieurs syndicats au sein de leurs usines de confection et 80 % de ces \nusines disposent d'accords collectifs suite à des négociations avec les syndicats. Au Vietnam, \nil est encourageant de constater que le gouvernement a accepté d'ouvrir la voie aux \norganisations syndicales, dans le cadre de son engagement dans l'accord de partenariat \ntranspacifique.  \n\n  Nous nous préoccupons du bien-être des travailleurs fabriquant nos produits et nous prenons \ndes mesures afin d'augmenter progressivement les rémunérations et d'offrir des salaires \njustes. Ces mesures sont prises en partenariat avec nos fournisseurs et la Fair Labor \nAssociation, un groupe de défense des droits du travail basé aux États-Unis. Sur chaque site \nde production majeur, nous comparons les salaires aux salaires minimums requis par le \ngouvernement, aux normes du secteur et à diverses autres mesures du salaire vital, car nous \nveillons à offrir une rémunération juste à nos travailleurs. Pour plus d'informations à ce sujet, \nveuillez consulter la page suivante : http://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/supply-\nchain/critical-issues-copy/#/fair-wages/ \n\n  Contrairement à ce qui a été affirmé dans le rapport, la falsification des horaires de travail ou \nde la comptabilité des salaires est une exception chez nos fournisseurs clés, qui représentent \nplus de 90 % de notre production mondiale. Nous avons travaillé en étroite collaboration avec \nnos fournisseurs clés afin de supprimer de telles pratiques. Ils sont des partenaires \nstratégiques à long terme et à ce titre, ils sont régulièrement évalués en bonne conformité \nconcernant le paiement approprié et en temps voulu des salaires et bénéfices, y compris la \nrémunération des heures supplémentaires, tout comme les droits aux congés et la couverture \nsociale.  \n\n  Enfin, nous disposons d'une politique et d'une approche bien développées concernant \n\nl'approvisionnement responsable, y compris avec un niveau de commandes visant à équilibrer \nle processus de confection, les approbations d'échanges de journées et un respect strict des \nréglementations, qui contribuent à réduire l'incidence d'un nombre excessif d'heures de \ntravail.  \n\n  Toutes ces réussites substantielles nous ont valu une reconnaissance positive et de bonnes \nnotations de la part de nombreuses parties prenantes. Reportez-vous par exemple à celles \nlistées sur notre site : http://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/managing-\nsustainability/awards-recognition/ \n\nNous espérons que ces commentaires seront utiles.  \n\nSincères salutations,  \n\nWilliam Anderson \n\nVice President  \nSocial and Environmental Affairs  \nAsia Pacific \nadidas Group"}

And contrary to what has been \nstated in the NGO report, we believe we are living up to our commitment to act responsibly in \nsourcing our products.  \n\nThe report makes some general statements about sourcing practices and manufacturing trends \nwhich we feel lack facts, are misinformed and therefore misleading. We would like to offer the \nfollowing points of clarification: \n\n-  China remains a key sourcing country for the adidas Group; it represents the highest \nconcentration of production facilities in our global supply chain. As well as exports, \nmanufacturing operations in China serve the growing domestic market in a country \nwhich is now the world’s second largest economy.  \n\n-  Decisions on where to place orders are complex, they are not based on where one can \nsecure the lowest wages, but on the interplay of available production capacity, the \ntechnical capability of a supplier to make a specific product, operating overheads and \nproductivity levels, trade benefits for the country of origin, market access, logistics, as \nwell as access to materials. \n\n-  Lean manufacturing, when applied correctly, offers workers the prospect of higher \n\nwages (though bonus schemes and incentives) with fewer working hours. It is generally \nbeneficial. \n\n-  Automation of certain production processes does help in managing escalating \n\nproduction costs, but the introduction of robotics and other such technologies in \ncountries such as China is not driven solely by higher materials costs and wages, but by \nlabour shortages; the next generation of job seekers are not looking to work in factories, \nthey would prefer to find employment in the growing service sector.  \n\n-  The automated shoe production which adidas Group recently launched in Germany is \ncalled a “Speed Factory”. It is designed to respond to consumer needs, by creating \nquick-response tailored-made products.  Essentially it brings manufacturing closer to \nthe local market. It is an innovative approach, but it cannot directly displace the high \nvolume production processes that reside in the major exporting countries in Asia.  \nIt is not true that labour rights are fewer, or that workers are deprived of the opportunity \nto secure fair wages outside of China, where state policy has seen a progressive \nincrease in salaries. In Cambodia for instance, 80% of adidas Group’s supplier partners \n\n- \n\n1 \n\n \n \n\fhave independent trade unions and wage levels in our supplier factories exceed the cost \nof living benchmark which has been set by local trade unions. In Indonesia 90% of our \nsuppliers have one or more unions operating in their manufacturing plants and 80% of \nthose unionized factories have collective bargaining agreements in place. And in \nVietnam it is encouraging to see that the government has agreed to open up the space \nfor trade unions, as part of its commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  \n\n-  We are concerned about the welfare of the workers who make our products and we are \ntaking steps to progressively improve compensation levels and deliver a fair wage. We \nare doing so in partnership with our suppliers and with the Fair Labor Association, which \nis a US-based labour advocacy group. In each of our major production locations we are \nbenchmarking wages against government mandated minimum wages, industry norms \nand various living wage measures, as we work towards a fair wage for workers. For \nmore information on this topic please see http://www.adidas-\ngroup.com/en/sustainability/supply-chain/critical-issues-copy/#/fair-wages/  \n\n-  Contrary to what has been stated in the report, falsification of working hours or payroll \nrecords is a rarity in our key suppliers, which account for more than 90% of our global \nproduction. We have worked closely with our key suppliers to eliminate such practices \nand as our long term strategic partners they consistently achieve good compliance in \nterms of the proper and timely payment of wages and benefits, including overtime \npremiums, as well as leave entitlements and social insurance.   \n\n-  Finally, we have a well-developed policy and approach to responsible sourcing including \nlevel loading of orders to balance the flow of production, swap day approvals, and strict \nlegal compliance, which together reduces the incidence of excessive working hours. \n-  All  of  these  substantial  achievements  have resulted  in  positive  recognition  and ratings \nfrom our  many  stakeholders.  See,  for  example, those  listed  on  our  corporate  website: \nhttp://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/managing-sustainability/awards-\nrecognition/ \n\nWe trust these comments are helpful. \n\nSincerely, \n\nWilliam Anderson \nVice President  \nSocial and Environmental Affairs \nAsia Pacific \n\n2"}

We’ve made significant improvements, driving positive \nchange for workers in contract factories and across the industry. We’ve also learned some \nimportant lessons along the way. These lessons have compelled us to invest in making \nsubstantial changes to our manufacturing approach to ensure that it is truly a sustainable \nbusiness.  \n\nWe are transforming our approach to manufacturing because know that when workers are \nvalued, issues of compensation, overtime, workplace conditions and worker engagement will \nfundamentally shift. Compliance with Nike’s Code of Conduct has always been a non-\nnegotiable requirement for our contract factories. We are now focused on working with \nfewer, better factory partners that share our philosophy that valued workers create a \nproductive and sustainable business model.  \n\n  Today, we work with 655 factories, down from 930 in FY11.  \n  86% of our factories currently have achieved a performance rating that demonstrates \n\ntheir commitment to valuing workers and improving environmental standards.  \n\n• We’re committed to reaching 100% by the end of FY20.  \n\nAs our relationship with workers and factories continues to evolve, we remain committed to \nthe power that transparency in our supply chain brings to our role as an industry leader. \n\n• A decade ago, Nike was the first company in our industry to publicly disclose our contract \nfactory base through our Nike Manufacturing Map. \n\n• In 2012, we launched our Sustainable Manufacturing and Sourcing Index (SMSI), an index \nfor measuring contract factory performance that elevates labor and environment standards \nto an equal level with traditional measures of quality, cost and delivery. \n\nWe are investing in working with our factory partners to better engage and value their \nworkers. Since 2012, we have run a number of pilot research programs in four countries \ndedicated to, among other topics, testing leadership mindset and worker engagement, \n\n \n\fcreating new compensation and benefit models for workers, and delivering smartphone \nservices to support and meet the needs of workers. These efforts are aimed at engaging, \nempowering and connecting workers to help make positive changes inside and outside the \nworkplace.  \n\nThese programs are yielding encouraging results: workers report improvements in key \nelements of well-being, including health, financial stability, free time and relationships with \ncontract factory management. However, we know enforcing standards is not enough. In \naddition to Nike’s Code of Conduct standards, we are developing and applying a Lean \nmanagement system across our source base that focuses on new approaches to \nengagement, training, problem solving, communications, compensation and incentives for \nworkers.  \n\nWe are proud of our approach to enforcing standards and incentivizing new business \nmodels. But we know there is still work to be done and we can’t do it alone. Partnerships \nwith governments, NGOs, brands, unions, factory workers and manufacturers are integral to \ndriving long-lasting, systemic change across the industry.  \n\nAs a critical next step, we are advocating for a convergence of compliance standards across \nthe entire industry. By working with partners to harmonize standards, we can raise the bar in \nfar more factories, and ensure far more workers are protected, valued and engaged. We \nstand ready to work with others and share what we have learned and implemented in our \nsource base with the aim of creating a new standard.  \n\nThis commitment to sustainable labor innovation is addressed in depth in our recently \nreleased Sustainable Business Report (see: http://about.nike.com/pages/sustainable-\ninnovation). We invite you to read this report to see how Nike aims to transform \nmanufacturing across our industry. \n\nSincerely, Nike, Inc.”"}

Nous avons fait des progrès significatifs qui ont eu des \neffets positifs pour les ouvriers de nos fournisseurs et du secteur dans son \nensemble. Nous avons également tiré certaines leçons importantes tout \nau long de cette période. Ces leçons nous ont poussés à investir pour \nchanger radicalement notre manière de concevoir la production et pour \nque notre entreprise soit véritable durable. \n\nNous changeons notre point de vue sur la production car nous savons que \nsi les ouvriers sont valorisés, nous assisterons à un bouleversement \nconcernant les questions de rémunérations, d'heures supplémentaires, de \nconditions de travail et d'engagement des travailleurs. Le respect du Code \nde conduite Nike a toujours été une condition non négociable pour nos \nsous-traitants. Nous cherchons désormais à travailler avec un nombre plus \nréduit d'usines partenaires, de meilleure qualité, qui partagent notre \nphilosophie selon laquelle des ouvriers valorisés sont la base d'un business \nmodel efficace et durable. \n\n  Aujourd'hui, nous travaillons avec 655 usines, comparé à 930 en \n\n2011. \n\n \n\f  86% de nos usines ont actuellement atteint une cote de performance \nqui démontre leur engagement envers la valorisation des travailleurs \net l'amélioration des normes environnementales. \n\n  Nous nous engageons à atteindre les 100 % d'ici fin 2020. \n\nTandis que notre relation avec les ouvriers et les usines continue d'évoluer, \nnous tenons les engagements qui découlent de notre rôle de leader du \nsecteur et du pouvoir qui nous est conféré par la transparence de notre \nchaîne d'approvisionnement. \n\n•                Il y a dix ans, Nike était la première entreprise du secteur à \nrendre publique sa base de sous-traitants via notre Nike Manufacturing \nMap. \n\n•                En 2012, nous lancions notre Sustainable Manufacturing and \nSourcing Index (SMSI), un indice de mesure des performances des sous-\ntraitants qui met les conditions de travail et les normes environnementales \nsur le même niveau que les mesures traditionnelles de qualité, de coûts et \nde livraison. \n\nNous travaillons avec nos usines partenaires pour obtenir un meilleur \nengagement et pour valoriser leurs ouvriers. Depuis 2012, nous avons \nlancé dans quatre pays plusieurs programmes de recherche pilotes dont \nl'objectif est, entre autres, de tester l'état d'esprit des équipes \ndirigeantes et l'engagement des travailleurs, de créer de nouveaux \nsystèmes de rémunérations et d'avantages pour les ouvriers, et de \nfournir des smartphones pour aider et répondre aux besoins des \ntravailleurs. Le but de ces efforts est d'engager, de donner du pouvoir et \nde connecter les ouvriers, pour qu'ils puissent être des moteurs de \nchangements positifs sur et en dehors de leur lieu de travail. \n\nCes programmes ont déjà donné des résultats encourageants : les \nouvriers pointent des améliorations dans des secteurs clés du bien-être \ncomme la santé, la stabilité financière, le temps libre et les relations avec \nla direction de l'entreprise sous-traitante. Cependant, nous savons \nqu'appliquer des normes ne suffit pas. Outre les normes du Code de \nconduite Nike, nous élaborons et imposons un système de lean \nmanagement à toutes nos ressources. Ce système se concentre sur notre \nnouvelle vision de l'engagement, de la formation, de la résolution des \nproblèmes, de la communication, de la rémunérations et des incitants \npour les travailleurs. \n\n\fNous sommes fiers de nos démarches en vue de l'application des normes \net de la stimulation de nouveaux business models. Mais nous savons qu'il \nreste du travail, et que nous ne pourrons tout faire seuls. Les partenariats \navec les gouvernements, les ONG, les marques, les syndicats, les ouvriers \ndes usines et les industriels font partie de notre programme visant à \nimposer un changement durable et systémique dans tout le secteur. \n\nL'étape suivante d'envergure est de promouvoir l'application de normes \ndans l'ensemble du secteur. En travaillant avec les partenaires pour \nharmoniser les normes, nous pouvons améliorer la situation dans \ndavantage d'usines, et nous assurer que beaucoup plus de travailleurs \nsoient protégés, valorisés et engagés. Nous sommes prêts à travailler avec \nles autres et à partager ce que nous avons appris et appliqué à notre base \nde ressources afin de créer de nouvelles normes. \n\nCet engagement envers des conditions de travail durables est détaillé dans \nnotre Sustainable Business Report publié récemment (voir : \nhttp://about.nike.com/pages/sustainable-innovation). Nous vous invitons \nà lire ce rapport pour découvrir comment Nike cherche à transformer la \nproduction dans tout le secteur. \n\nCordialement, \nNike, Inc.”"}

Samarco and its shareholders are hopeful that Samarco will be able to resume \noperations and to generate all or a substantial part of the funding required under the agreement. \nTo the extent Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton \nBrasil is liable in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\nThe agreement was ratified by the Federal Court of Brazil, at a conciliation hearing held on May \n5th, at the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nVale’s 4.59% interest in Belo Monte is in line with its strategy to guarantee availability of electric \npower in the long term for its operations and in line with the Brazilian commitment to reduce \ngreenhouse gases emissions. \n\nIn March 2015, Vale transferred its 9% stake in Norte Energia Participações S.A. (the Belo \nMonte hydroelectric power plant) to Aliança Norte Energia Participações (Aliança Norte), a joint \nventure between Vale and Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nVale now indirectly holds a 4.59% interest in Belo Monte, while Cemig GT has a 4.41% stake in \nthe project through Aliança Norte. This reduction in Vale’s interest in Belo Monte is in line with \nits global strategy to focus on its core business, without harming the availability of electric power \nfor its operations. \n\nSince its entry into the Belo Monte project, Vale has hired professionals with extensive \nexperience in the implementation and operation of hydropower projects, especially in studies of \nenvironmental and socioeconomic impacts and indigenous issues. This allows Vale to track and \nverify that these issues are being addressed appropriately, from planning to execution of the \nproject, aiming at positive results and improving the quality and living conditions of the \ncommunities established in the region where the project is being built. \n\nThroughout its development, the plant design was deeply modified in order to restrict the impact \nof the activities on the environment and on the local population. The flooded area was reduced \nby 60 %, compared to the original design. The plant complex, including reservoirs, roads, \ntransmission lines, camps and other auxiliary structures, will occupy 559 Km2. Of this total, 156 \nkm2 (27%) needs to be deforested as the rest of the area consists of the riverbed and non-\nnative vegetation types, such as pastures, cultivated areas, and areas of mineral extraction. \n\nThe Belo Monte project has taken necessary precautions not to flood any indigenous lands and \nto avoid impacts in implementing the construction of sites, access roads, dam and other \nengineering structures needed to build the project. There are also no plans to resettle villages, \nin line with the project’s commitment to reduce its impacts on the surrounding area and local \ncommunities. \n\nDuring its implementation phase, the project is investing around R$4.23 billion in social and \nenvironmental initiatives, of which R$3.74 billion had been spent by March 2016 (88% of the \ntotal planned amount). The remaining disbursement will happen until 2019. \n\nThe management of social and environmental aspects is guided by the Basic Environmental \nPlan, which is being implemented through 117 programs, plans and projects, encompassing \nsocial, indigenous, land-related and physical-biotic investments, aimed at compensating for and \nmitigating the potential impacts identified in the environmental viability studies.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fSocial investments in local municipalities and indigenous communities represent around 60% of \nthe budget, covering social, cultural, economic and infrastructure aspects.  \n\nIn December 2015, about R $ 2.282 billion had been invested in social investments, being R$ \n497.83 million in health and sanitation, R$ 769,81 million in land acquisition and regularization, \nsocial communication, economic recovery for the population, preservation of cultural heritage \nand support for surrounding municipalities. \n\nThe modernization of the infrastructure of the city of Altamira was made, with the construction of \na linear park with 20 hectares, 7 new bridges in concrete and two pedestrian bridges. The entire \ncity waterfront was also revitalized with the construction of artificial beaches and structures for \nmarketing of fish and maintenance of vessels. \n\nWe highlight initiatives to monitor and improve health, education, training, income generation \nand appreciation of cultural and intangible heritage. Of these investments, 108 projects have \nbeen completed to build or renovate schools, benefiting 12,000 students from public education. \n\nIn the health area, 20 new primary health care units and a hospital with 104 beds were built and \nalready delivered to Altamira Prefecture. Until October 2015, R$ 5.220 million had been \ninvested in teams for the implementation of the Family Health Program (PSF). We highlight the \nstrategic investments to reduce cases of malaria in the region, achieving significant results with \nthe reduction of 99.1 % of recorded cases in the period from 2011 to 2015. \n\nIn the area of public safety, US$ 70 million were addressed to infrastructure and equipment \ninvestment through an agreement between Norte Energia and the Secretariat of Public Security \nof the State of Pará. \n\nAs part of social and environmental requirements related to the creation of Belo Monte’s \nreservoir, work is under way to comply with the National Solid Waste Plan, which has involved \nremediating existing dumps, completed in October 2012, and implementing sanitary landfills, in \noperation since early 2013, for the municipalities of Altamira and Vitória do Xingu, benefiting a \npopulation of approximately 120,000 people. \n\nAlso in 2013, work began on building these municipalities’ entire water and sewage systems, \ninvolving investments of around R$500 million and completed in late 2014, significantly \nimproving the way urban waste is disposed of in the region, where conditions used to be much \nworse than in Brazil as a whole. \n\nAs the reservoir is formed, the urban population previously living in areas of “palafitas” (houses \non stilts) in the city of Altamira has being resettled in new neighborhoods. R$ 727.36 million \nwere invested in the construction of five new neighborhoods with all sanitation infrastructure, \neducation and leisure in the city of Altamira, where the families living in the bayous region were \nrelocated.  \n\nThe implementation of the Basic Environmental Plan also involves actions for the physical-\nbioticenvironment, including research, monitoring and environmental conservation activities. \nThese mitigation and compensation initiatives include a Conservation Unit Implementation and \nManagement Action Support Project, an Action Plan to Conserve Endangered and Endemic \nFauna and Flora Species in the Lower and Middle Xingu Region, and an agreement with the \nChico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), encompassing more than 90 \nconservation initiatives. Other notable measures include the implementation of a tree nursery, \nthe restoration of degraded areas, water quality monitoring and control, and encouragement for \nsustainable fishing. \n\nTo meet the commitments provided for in the environmental licenses, the programs defined for \nthe Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous Component (PBA-CI), overseen by the National \nIndian  Foundation (FUNAI), establish thematic areas of activity that consider the indigenous \npeople’s expectations identified in consultation meetings held before the issuing of the \nenvironmental licenses. These programs cover Territorial Management, Special Indigenous \nPeople’s Health, Indigenous People’s School Education, Material and Intangible Cultural \nHeritage, Institutional Strengthening, Reallocation and Resettlement of Indigenous City Dwellers \nin Altamira, Environmental Supervision, Non-Indigenous Communication, and productive \nactivities involving a variety of subsistence and income-generation projects for indigenous \ncommunities.  \n\n \n \n\fThere is also an infrastructure program for villages in the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant’s \narea of influence, involving various works already executed, such as the following: Territorial \nProtection Units to support government actions to monitor indigenous lands; construction of an \nIndian House in Altamira to support indigenous village dwellers who are passing through the \ncity; landing strips to support aeromedical removals; highway renovation and maintenance; \nconstruction of flour mills; installation of a water supply and distribution system in villages \n(including artesian wells); and construction of sewage collection and treatment facilities. Work is \nalso under way to build schools and basic health facilities in the 34 villages located in the \nproject’s area of influence, besides other initiatives contained in the PBA-CI’s Operating Plan. \n\nIn programs for indigenous peoples, of the R $ 463.35 million expected to be invested by the \nend of 2016, more than R$ 287.7 million were already employed in the construction of 711 \nhouses, 34 basic health units , 29 water supplies systems, 21 airstrips and 34 houses for \nproduction of cassava flour in the villages. The Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous \nComponent benefits now about 3 500 indigenous residents of the villages located in the vicinity \nof the project. \n\nDuring the first two years, heavy investment was also made to support indigenous communities \nby donating a wide range of items, such as boats, boat engines, motor-generators, vehicles and \nfuel to support subsistence activities and cultural activities, as well as other items to improve the \npeople’s quality of life. \n\nThe project’s environmental licensing process also required the execution of initiatives to \ncontribute to governmental strategies for the socioeconomic development of the Xingu region. \nTo this end, in partnership with the state and federal governments, we highlight the Xingu \nRegional Sustainable Development Plan (PDRSX), which has a total budget of R$500 million. \nThis plan is aimed at implementing public policies in the following areas: Territorial Ordering and \nLand Use Regularization; Infrastructure; Promotion of Productive Sustainable Activities; Social \nInclusion; and a Management Model for Large Construction Projects. \n\nEnvironmental and social issues, among other strategic topics, are discussed by the \nEnvironmental Advisory Committee, whose members are appointed by Norte Energia’s \nshareholders. Vale, through Aliança Norte, appoints one representative to this committee and a \nrespective alternate member until the end of the Belo Monte hydroelectric project’s \nimplementation phase. Starting from the operational phase, Cemig GT and Vale will then \nalternately appoint their representative every three years. The committee’s main objective is to \nanalyze social and environmental subjects and recommend whether or not to approve \nmeasures to Norte Energia’s Board of Directors, which is composed of 12 members appointed \nby shareholders \n\nThrough Aliança Norte, Vale appoints one member and a respective alternate member to \nNorteEnergia’s Board of Directors, with the right to one vote at meetings, where subjects need \nto be approved by a vote of at least eight members. Vale and Cemig GT alternately appoint \nAliança Norte’s member of the Board of Directors every three years, as determined in Aliança \nNorte’s shareholders agreement. \n\nRegarding the media reports about the corruption scheme related to Belo Monte, as a result of \nthese allegations, Eletrobrás hired specialists to conduct an internal investigation on Norte \nEnergia. To date, there was no conclusive report. \n\nWe emphasize that the acquisition by Vale of stakes in the project occurred in 2011, a year after \nthe auction was done, and when the construction contracts were already signed.  \n\nVale´s administrator’s remuneration  \n\nUnder our bylaws, our shareholders are responsible for establishing the aggregate \ncompensation we pay to the members of our Board of Directors and our Board of Executive \nOfficers, and the Board of Directors allocates the compensation among its members and the \nBoard of Executive Officers. \n\nOur shareholders determine this annual aggregate compensation at the general shareholders’ \nmeeting each year.  In order to establish aggregate director and officer compensation, our \n\n \n \n \n \n\fshareholders usually take into account various factors, which range from attributes, experience \nand skills of our directors and executive officers to the recent performance of our operations.  \nOnce aggregate compensation is established, our Board of Directors is then responsible for \ndistributing such aggregate compensation in compliance with our bylaws among the directors \nand executive officers.  The Executive Development Committee makes recommendations to the \nBoard concerning the annual aggregate compensation of the executive officers.  In addition to \nfixed compensation, our executive officers are also eligible for bonuses and incentive payments. \n\nFixed compensation and in kind benefits include a base salary in cash, paid on a monthly basis, \nreimbursement for certain investments in private pension plans, health care, relocation \nexpenses, life insurance, driver and car expenses. \n\n Variable compensation consists of (i) an annual cash bonus, based on specific targets for each \nexecutive officer, approved by our Board of Directors, and (ii) payments tied to the performance \nof our shares under two programs, the Matching Program and the Performance Shares Units \n(PSU). \n\nProfit Sharing of Vale employees  \n\nThe Profit Sharing of employees is calculated based on individual and team results and on \ncompany's performance, having the cash flow and the spending on current investments as a \ntrigger. This indicator was below the set trigger, so there was no payment of Profit Sharing in \n2016. \n\nThe value of the trigger, measured by the cash generation indicator (Operating Cash Flow \nminus Current Investment), is $ 5.9 billion. As the value obtained was below the trigger, the \nProfit Sharing was zero. \n\nThe current model was created with the aim of strengthening the emphasis on meritocracy and \nmore accurately reflect the company's results. This methodology was negotiated and approved \nby the Unions through Collective Agreements signed in 2014, to take effect in 2014 and 2015. \n\nResources allocated for repairing and compensation of Samarco´s accident \n\nOn March 2nd, 2016, Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco) and its two shareholders, Vale S.A \n(Vale) and BHP Billiton Brasil LTDA (BHPB Brasil), have entered into an agreement with the \nFederal Government, represented by the Attorney General of Brazil, the States of Espírito \nSanto and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities (Brazilian Authorities) for the \nrestoration of the environment and communities affected by the Samarco dam failure on \nNovember 5th, 2015 (“Agreement”).  \n\nThe Agreement establishes the obligation for Samarco, Vale and BHPB to create a private \nfoundation, that will be responsible for implementing about 40 socio-economic and \nenvironmental programs to address the impacts of the accident. The document contains the \nemergency actions that have been conducted by Samarco since November, 2015, and \nproposes mid-term and long-term projects to remediate and compensate the impacts arising \nfrom the dam rupture. \n\nAccording to the Agreement, Samarco shall contribute to the Foundation the total amount of R$ \n4.4 billion, during its first three years, to fund the projects. From 2019 to 2021, annual \ncontributions to the Foundation will be set according to the annual implementation of the \nremaining planned remediation and compensation projects. The annual reference values for \nthese contributions will be between R $ 800 million and R$ 1.6 billion. In the following years, \nSamarco's contribution will be set on amounts sufficient for the execution of the remaining \nprojects of the programs established under the Agreement. To the extent Samarco does not \nmeet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil is liable in proportion to its 50 \nper cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSamarco accident and the Krenak \n\nSince 1997, Vale has established a relationship and support actions with the Indigenous People \nKrenak, when the group had its his territory officially established, boarding 6.5 km along the \nDoce River and the Estrada de Ferro Vitória Minas (EFVM), operated by Vale since 1940. \n\nIn November 2015, Vale started emergency additional support to the Indigenous People Krenak \nfocused on water supply among other inputs in order to minimize the immediate effects resulting \nfrom the Fundão Dam accident. Currently, Samarco is assuming the conduction of the actions \nrelated to the accident. \n\n \n \n \n\fRespostas em português  \n\nCausas do acidente da Samarco \n\nA barragem de Fundão, da mineradora Samarco, se rompeu na tarde de 5 de novembro de \n2015, no município de Mariana, em Minas Gerais, o que resultou no deslocamento de parte dos \nrejeitos de mineração ali depositados e no galgamento da barragem de Santarém. Não é \npossível, neste momento, confirmar as causas do ocorrido.  \n\nA Samarco abriu um canal para o público visando esclarecer, de forma transparente, todos os \ndetalhes sobre o caso. Acesse: http://bit.ly/Samarco. \n\nO acidente da Samarco e os resultados da Vale \n\nComo acionista da Samarco, juntamente com a BHP Billiton, a Vale tem promovido o suporte \ndas ações destinadas a garantir a integridade física, a segurança e os direitos fundamentais \ndas pessoas afetadas pelo acidente. Desde o primeiro dia, disponibilizamos recursos humanos \ne materiais para auxiliar a Samarco. No entanto, estas despesas não afetaram o resultado da \nVale de 2015, conforme informado no Relatório 20-F da companhia. \n\nÉ importante ressaltar que no Relatório 20-F de 2015 da Vale o seguinte risco foi relatado para \nos investidores: \n\n“Nossas obrigações nos termos do contrato de acordo decorrente da ruptura da \nbarragem da Samarco poderão ter um impacto substancial sobre nossa condição \nfinanceira \n\nA Samarco e seus acionistas, Vale e BHPB Brasil Ltda. (“BHPB”), uma subsidiária brasileira da \nBHP Billiton plc (“BHP Billiton”), firmaram um acordo no dia 2 de março de 2016 com órgãos \ngovernamentais, inclusive com a União Federal e com os dois Estados brasileiros afetados \npela ruptura da barragem (Espírito Santo e Minas Gerais). De acordo com o contrato, Samarco, \nVale e BHPB criarão uma fundação para desenvolver e implementar programas de \nrecuperação e compensação em valores substanciais ao longo de muitos anos.”  \n\n“Atualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, Vale e BHPB estarão \nobrigadas a alocar verbas para a fundação, proporcionais às suas respectivas participações \nacionárias de 50% na Samarco. A Vale não espera atualmente registrar uma provisão nas suas \ndemonstrações contábeis com relação a essas obrigações, mas se a Samarco for \neventualmente incapaz de retomar as operações ou cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, \npoderá vir a reconhecer eventual provisão.” \n\nAcordo firmado entre Samarco, Vale e BHP Billiton com a União e os governos de Minas \nGerais e do Espírito Santo  \n\nO acordo prevê ações de reparação e compensação de longo prazo para responder ao impacto \ndo acidente envolvendo a barragem da Samarco. Conforme os seus termos, a Samarco, a Vale \ne a BHP Billiton Brasil irão estabelecer uma fundação privada que será responsável pelo \ndesenvolvimento e execução dos programas ambientais e socioeconômicos de remediação e \ncompensação previstos naquele instrumento. \n\nAtualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. A Samarco e seus acionistas estão esperançosos que a Samarco seja capaz de \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fretomar as operações e gerar a totalidade ou uma parte substancial dos recursos necessários \nao cumprimento do acordo. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de aporte na fundação, \nVale e BHPB estarão obrigadas a alocar verbas para esse fim, proporcionais às suas \nrespectivas participações acionárias de 50% na Samarco.  \n\nO acordo foi homologado pela Justiça Federal brasileira, na audiência de conciliação realizada \nem 05 de maio de 2016 no Tribunal Regional Federal da 1ª Região. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nA participação de 4,59% na Hidrelétrica de Belo Monte é consistente com a nossa estratégia de \ngarantir fornecimento de energia elétrica no longo prazo para nossas operações e alinhada \ncom o compromisso brasileiro de redução de emissões de gases de efeito estufa. Em março de \n2015, a Vale transferiu a sua participação de 9% na Norte Energia Participações S.A (UHE \nBelo Monte) para a empresa Aliança Norte Energia Participações S.A. (Aliança Norte), joint \nventure formada entre a Vale e a Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nAtualmente a Vale detém, de forma indireta, a participação de 4,59% na Norte Energia (UHE \nBelo Monte) e a Cemig GT, por sua vez, detém 4,41% de participação em Belo Monte, através \nda Aliança Norte. Essa redução de participação em Belo Monte está em linha com a estratégia \nglobal da Vale de foco no seu core business, sem comprometer a disponibilidade de energia \npara suas operações. \n\nDesde a sua entrada no projeto de Belo Monte, a Vale contratou profissionais com vasta \nexperiência na implantação e operação de projetos hidrelétricos, especialmente em estudos de \nimpactos ambientais e socioeconômicos e questões indígenas. Isso nos permite acompanhar e \nverificar se esses assuntos estão sendo tratados de forma adequada desde o planejamento até \na execução do projeto, objetivando resultados positivos e a melhoria da qualidade e condição \nde vida das comunidades da região onde o projeto está sendo construído. \n\nAo longo de sua elaboração, o projeto da usina foi profundamente modificado com vistas a \nrestringir os impactos que poderiam acarretar ao meio ambiente e à população da região. A \nárea de inundação foi reduzida em 60% em comparação ao projeto original. O complexo da \nusina, que inclui reservatórios, estradas, linha de transmissão, acampamentos e outras \nestruturas auxiliares, ocupará 559 Km2. Deste total, será necessário desmatar 156 Km2 de \nfloresta (27%), porque o restante da área é composto pelo leito do rio e formações vegetais \nnão-nativas, como pastagens, áreas cultivadas, e áreas de extração mineral. \n\nO projeto de Belo Monte adotou todo o cuidado necessário para não inundar terras indígenas, \ne não ter impacto na implantação de canteiros de obras, pelas estradas de acesso, pela \nbarragem e demais estruturas de engenharia necessárias à construção do empreendimento. \nTampouco há previsão de realocação de aldeias, reafirmando o compromisso do projeto com a \nredução dos impactos sobre a área circundante e comunidades locais. \n\nDurante a fase de implantação, o projeto terá investimentos socioambientais de cerca de R$ \n4,23 bilhões, tendo sido investidos R$ 3,75 bilhões até março de 2016, representando 88% do \nvalor total previsto. Existe a previsão de desembolso do valor restante até 2019, quando se \nfinaliza a montagem das unidades geradoras da Casa de Força principal. A gestão dos \naspectos socioambientais é orientada pelo Plano Básico Ambiental (PBA), que se desdobra em \n117 programas, planos e projetos, englobando investimentos sociais, indígenas, fundiário e \nmeio físico-biótico, visando a compensação e mitigação dos impactos potenciais identificados \nnos estudos de viabilidade ambiental. \n\nOs investimentos sociais para os municípios e comunidades indígenas, localizados na região \ndo empreendimento, representam cerca de 60% do orçamento, englobando aspectos sociais, \nculturais, econômicos e de infraestrutura. Em dezembro de 2015 já haviam sido investidos \ncerca de R$ 2,282 bilhões em investimentos sociais, sendo R$ 497,83 milhões na área de \nsaúde e saneamento, R$ 769,81 milhões em ações de aquisição e regularização fundiária, \ncomunicação social, recomposição econômica para a população e preservação do patrimônio \ncultural e apoio aos municípios do entorno. Houve a modernização da infraestrutura da cidade \nde Altamira com a construção de um parque linear com área de 20 hectares, 7 novas pontes \nem concreto e 2 passarelas para pedestres. Toda a orla da cidade também foi revitalizada com \n\n \n \n \n \n\fa construção de praias artificiais e estruturas para comercialização do pescado e manutenção \ndas embarcações.. \n\nDestacam-se ações de controle e melhoria das condições de saúde, educação, capacitação, \ngeração de renda e valorização do patrimônio histórico cultural e imaterial. Destes \ninvestimentos foram concluídas 108 obras de construção e reforma de escolas, beneficiando \n12 mil alunos da rede pública de educação. Na área de saúde, 20 novas unidades básicas de \nsaúde e um hospital com 104 leitos construídos e já entregues à Prefeitura de Altamira, tendo \nsido investidos até outubro de 2015 R$ 5,220 milhões em equipes para implantação do \nPrograma de Saúde da Família (PSF). Destacam-se na área da saúde os investimentos \nestratégicos para redução dos casos de malária na região, alcançando resultados significativos \ncom a redução de 99,1% dos casos constatados da doença no período de 2011 a 2015. \n\nNa área da segurança pública, foram destinados, desde o início das obras, R$70 milhões em \ninfraestrutura e equipamentos através de convênio firmado entre a Norte Energia e a Secretaria \nde Segurança Pública do Estado do Pará. \n\nDentre as exigências socioambientais para formação do reservatório do aproveitamento \nhidrelétrico Belo Monte está em andamento o atendimento ao Plano Nacional de Resíduos \nSólidos, com a remediação dos atuais lixões, concluídos em outubro de 2012, e a implantação \nde aterros sanitários, em operação desde início de 2013, para os municípios de Altamira e \nVitória do Xingu, beneficiando uma população de aproximadamente 120.000 habitantes. \n\nAinda em 2013, iniciaram as obras de construção de todo o sistema de abastecimento de água \ne esgotamento e tratamento sanitário destes municípios, com investimentos da ordem de R$ \n500 milhões, concluídas no final de 2014, modificando significativamente o panorama atual das \ncondições gerais de destinação final de resíduos urbanos, que apresentam forte desvantagem \nem relação às condições a nível nacional. \n\nPara a formação do reservatório foi efetivada a realocação da população urbana das áreas de \npalafitas da cidade de Altamira, tendo sido investido R$ 727,36 milhões na construção de 5 \nnovos bairros com toda infraestrutura de saneamento, educação e lazer na cidade de Altamira, \n\nonde foram realocadas as famílias moradoras da região dos igarapés. A implantação do Plano \nBásico Ambiental (PBA) desenvolve ainda ações para o meio físico-biótico, com pesquisas, \nmonitoramentos e atividades de conservação ambiental. Dentre estas ações de mitigação e \ncompensação, destacam-se o Projeto de Apoio às Ações de Implantação e Manejo de Unidade \nde Conservação e o Plano de Ação para Conservação das Espécies da Fauna e Flora \nAmeaçadas e Endêmicas na Região do Baixo e Médio Xingu, convênio com o Instituto Chico \nMendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio), onde estão previstas mais de 90 ações \nconservacionistas. Cabe ainda ressaltar a implantação do Viveiro de Mudas, Recuperação de \nÁreas Degradadas, Monitoramento e Controle da Qualidade de Água e Incentivo e Apoio à \nPesca Sustentável. \n\nEm atendimento ao compromisso previsto nas licenças ambientais, os programas definidos \npara o Plano Básico Ambiental - Componente Indígena (PBA-CI), sob a orientação da \nFundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI), estabelecem eixos temáticos de atuação em que foram \nconsideradas as expectativas indígenas identificadas durante as reuniões de consultas prévias \nà emissão das licenças ambientais, incluindo os Programas de Gestão Territorial, Saúde \nEspecial Indígena, Educação Escolar Indígena, Patrimônio Cultural Material e Imaterial, \nFortalecimento Institucional, Realocação e Reassentamento dos Indígenas Citadinos de \nAltamira, Supervisão Ambiental, Comunicação Não Indígena, Programa de atividades \nprodutivas com diversos projetos de subsistência e geração de renda para as comunidades \nindígenas e o Programa de infraestrutura nas aldeias da área de influência da UHE Belo Monte \ncom diversas obras já executadas, como: Unidades de Proteção Territorial em apoio às ações \nde Governo para o monitoramento das terras indígenas, Construção da Casa do Índio em \nAltamira para apoiar os indígenas aldeados em trânsito na cidade, pistas de pouso para apoio \nnas remoções aeromédicas, reformas e manutenções em estradas, construções de casas de \nfarinha, de sistema de abastecimento e distribuição de água nas aldeias (poços artesianos), \ncaptação e tratamento sanitário, entre outras, assim como já em curso a construção de escolas \ne Unidades Básicas de Saúde nas 34 aldeias localizadas na área de influência do \nempreendimento e demais ações contidas no Plano Operativo do PBA do Componente \nIndígena. Em programas para povos indígenas, dos R$ 463,35 milhões previstos para serem \ninvestidos até o final de 2016 já foram empregados mais de R$ 287,7 milhões na construção de \n\n \n \n\f711 casas de moradias, 34 unidades básicas de saúde, 29 sistemas de abastecimentos de \nágua, 21 pistas de pouso e 34 casas para produção de farinha de mandioca nas aldeias. O \nPlano Básico Ambiental Indígena beneficia hoje cerca de 3,5 mil indígenas moradores das \naldeias localizadas no entorno do Projeto Belo Monte e que são atendidos pela Norte Energia. \n\nDurante os 02 primeiros anos houve também um grande investimento em apoio para as \ncomunidades indígenas com a doação de diversos itens como: embarcações, motores \nnáuticos, motores geradores, veículos, combustível em apoio nas suas atividades de \nsubsistência e atividades culturais e demais itens para o melhoramento da qualidade dessa \npopulação. \n\nConsidera-se ainda, no processo de licenciamento ambiental do empreendimento, o \ndesenvolvimento de ações que contribuam com estratégias governamentais para o \ndesenvolvimento socioeconômico da região do Xingu. Nesta direção, em parceria com os \ngovernos Estadual e Federal, destaca-se o Plano de Desenvolvimento Regional Sustentável do \nXingu (PDRSX), com orçamento total de R$ 500 milhões, que objetiva a implementação de \npolíticas públicas com eixos de ação para o Ordenamento Territorial e Regularização Fundiária, \nInfraestrutura, Fomento às Atividades Produtivas Sustentáveis, Inclusão Social e Modelo de \nGestão para Grandes Obras. \n\nAs questões ambientais e sociais, entre outros assuntos estratégicos, são tratadas no Comitê \nConsultivo Ambiental, onde os membros são nomeados por cada acionista. A Vale, através da \nAliança Norte, indica um representante no Comitê Consultivo Ambiental e seu respectivo \nsuplente, sendo essa indicação alternada com a Cemig GT, a partir da fase de operação, a \ncada período de 3 anos. O principal objetivo do Comitê Consultivo Ambiental é analisar as \nquestões socioambientais e recomendar a sua aprovação ou não ao Conselho de \nAdministração. O Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia é formado por 12 membros \nindicados pelos acionistas. A Vale, por sua vez, através da Aliança Norte, indica um membro e \nseu respectivo suplente, com direito a um voto nas reuniões do referido órgão, onde as \nmatérias são aprovadas a partir do voto afirmativo de, pelos menos, 8 membros. Além disso, a \nindicação do membro para o Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia, a ser feita pela \nAliança Norte, é alternada entre Vale e Cemig GT a cada período de 3 anos, conforme definido \nno Acordo de Acionistas da Aliança Norte. \n\nCom relação às notícias veiculadas na mídia sobre esquema de corrupção em Belo Monte, em \nfunção destas, a Eletrobrás contratou especialistas para os trabalhos de investigação na Norte \nEnergia. Nesta data ainda não há um relatório conclusivo emitido. Há expectativa de que o \nrelatório final seja emitido ainda em junho de 2016. \n\nRessaltamos que a aquisição pela Vale de participação no projeto ocorreu em 2011, um ano \napós o leilão, e em um momento em que os contratos do consórcio construtor já estavam \nfirmados. \n\nRemuneração da administração Vale \n\nDe acordo com nosso estatuto social, nossos acionistas são responsáveis por estabelecer a \nremuneração agregada que pagamos aos membros de nosso Conselho de Administração e \nnossa Diretoria, e o Conselho de Administração distribui a remuneração entre seus membros e \na Diretoria. \n\nNossos acionistas determinam esta remuneração agregada anual na assembleia de acionistas \na cada ano. A fim de estabelecer a remuneração agregada do membro do Conselho e do \nDiretor, nossos acionistas geralmente consideram vários fatores, que variam desde atributos, \nexperiência e competências de nossos membros do Conselho e Diretores ao desempenho \nrecente de nossas operações. Uma vez que a remuneração agregada é estabelecida, os \nmembros de nosso Conselho de Administração são, então, responsáveis por distribuir tal \nremuneração agregada, em cumprimento ao nosso estatuto social, entre os membros do \nConselho e Diretores. O Comitê Executivo de Desenvolvimento faz recomendações ao \nConselho a respeito da remuneração agregada anual dos Diretores. Além de uma \nremuneração fixa, nossos Diretores também podem receber pagamentos de bônus e \nincentivos. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fA remuneração fixa e os benefícios em espécie incluem um salário base em dinheiro, pago \nmensalmente, o ressarcimento de certos investimentos em planos de pensão privados, \nserviços de saúde, despesas de transferência, seguro de vida, motorista e despesas com \nautomóvel. \n\nA remuneração variável consiste em (i) uma gratificação anual em dinheiro, baseada nas metas \nespecíficas para cada diretor executivo, aprovada por nosso Conselho de Administração, e (ii) \npagamentos vinculados ao desempenho de nossas ações de acordo com dois programas, o \nPrograma de Matching e as Unidades de Desempenho de Ações (PSU). \n\nParticipação nos lucros e resultados de empregados Vale \n\nA Participação nos Lucros e Resultados (PLR) dos empregados é calculada a partir dos \nresultados do empregado e de sua equipe e do desempenho da empresa, tendo o fluxo de \ncaixa e o gasto em investimentos correntes como gatilho. Esse indicador ficou abaixo do \ngatilho estabelecido, por isso não houve pagamento de PLR em 2016. \n\nO valor do gatilho, medido pelo indicador de Geração de Caixa (Fluxo de Caixa Operacional \nmenos os Investimentos Correntes), é de US$ 5,9 bilhões. Como o valor obtido ficou abaixo do \ngatilho, a PLR ficou em zero. \n\nO atual modelo foi criado com o objetivo de reforçar a ênfase na meritocracia e refletir com \nmaior precisão os resultados da empresa. Este foi aprovado em 2014 e aplicado nos cálculos \nde PLR de 2015. \n\nRecursos alocados para a reparação e compensação do acidente da Samarco  \n\nSamarco,Vale e BHP Billiton assinaram, no dia 02 de março de 2016, um acordo com os \ngovernos Federal, dos Estados de Minas Gerais e do Espírito Santo e outras entidades nos \ntermos do qual foram estabelecidos programas para a adoção de medidas de recuperação \nsocial, ambiental e econômica dos municípios e pessoas atingidas pelo rompimento da \nbarragem de Fundão, ocorrido em 05 de novembro de 2015. \n\nO acordo prevê a criação de uma fundação de direito privado que ficará responsável pela \nimplantação desses programas (cerca de 40), os quais estão reunidos em duas principais \nfrentes de trabalho, uma socioeconômica e outra socioambiental. O documento também elenca \nas ações emergenciais que vêm sendo adotadas pela Samarco desde novembro e propõe \nprojetos de médio e longo prazo a serem implementados para endereçar os impactos do \nacidente. \n\nA Samarco deverá aportar na fundação o total de R$ 4,4 bilhões, durante os três primeiros \nanos, para custear os projetos previstos no acordo. De 2019 a 2021, as contribuições anuais \npara a fundação serão definidas de acordo com o orçamento anual previsto para os projetos e \nmedidas remanescentes de remediação e compensação. Os valores anuais de referência para \nessas contribuições ficarão entre R$ 800 milhões e R$ 1,6 bilhões. Nos anos seguintes, o \naporte da Samarco deverá ser em patamar suficiente para a execução dos projetos e medidas \nremanescentes dos programas estabelecidos no acordo. \n\nO acidente da Samarco e os Krenak \n\nDesde 1997, a Vale se relaciona e apoia o Povo Indígena Krenak, quando a etnia teve seu \nterritório demarcado, passando a fazer fronteira ao longo de 6,5 km com o Rio Doce e com a \nEstrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM), operada pela Vale desde 1940. \n\nEm novembro de 2015, a Vale entrou com apoio adicional de caráter emergencial ao Povo \nIndígena Krenak, voltado para o abastecimento de água e garantia de insumos para minimizar \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fos efeitos imediatos decorrentes do acidente da barragem do Fundão.  Atualmente, a própria \nSamarco vem assumindo a condução das ações relacionadas ao acidente junto aos Krenak."}

It is not possible \nat this time to confirm the causes of the accident.  \n\nSamarco opened a channel for the public aiming to clarify, in a transparent manner, all the \ndetails about the case. Access: http://bit.ly/Samarco. \n\nThe Samarco accident and  Vale´s results \n\nAs a shareholder in Samarco, together with BHP Billiton, Vale has been participating actively in \nmeasures to guarantee the safety and the fundamental rights of the people affected by the \naccident. Since the first day, we have been providing human and material resources to aid \nSamarco. However , these expenses did not affect the Vale´s 2015 results, as reported in our \nForm 20 -F. \n\nIt is important to highlight that in Vale’s 2015 20-F there is the following risk factor disclosed to \ninvestors: \n\n“Our obligations under a settlement agreement arising from the failure of Samarco’s \ntailings dam could have a material impact on our financial condition. \n\nSamarco and its shareholders, Vale and BHPB Brasil Ltda. (“BHPB”), a Brazilian subsidiary of \nBHP Billiton plc (“BHP Billiton”), entered into a settlement agreement on March 2, 2016 with \ngovernmental authorities, including the federal Attorney General of Brazil and the two Brazilian \nstates affected by the failure (Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais).  Under the agreement, \nSamarco, Vale and BHPB will create a foundation to develop and implement remediation and \ncompensation programs in substantial amounts over many years.”   \n\n“ Samarco is currently unable to conduct ordinary mining and processing. Samarco’s \nmanagement is working on a plan that would permit it to resume operations, but the feasibility, \ntiming and scope of restarting remain uncertain.  If Samarco does not meet its funding \nobligations, each of Vale and BHPB is obligated to provide funding to the foundation in \nproportion to its 50% interest in Samarco.  Vale does not currently expect to record a provision \nin its financial statements in respect of these obligations, but if Samarco is eventually unable to \nresume operations or to meet its funding obligations, Vale could determine that it should \nrecognize a provision. “ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAgreement established between Samarco, Vale e BHP Billiton and Federal, Minas Gerais \nand Espírito Santo governments  \n\nThe Agreement provides for a long-term remedial and compensation framework to address the \nimpacts of the Samarco accident. Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil will establish a \nFoundation that will develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs to \nremediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure.  \n\nThe funds to the Foundation will be provided primarily by Samarco. Samarco is currently unable \nto conduct ordinary mining and processing. Samarco management is working on a plan that \nwould permit it to resume operations, but the feasibility, timing and scope of restarting remain \nuncertain.  Samarco and its shareholders are hopeful that Samarco will be able to resume \noperations and to generate all or a substantial part of the funding required under the agreement. \nTo the extent Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton \nBrasil is liable in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\nThe agreement was ratified by the Federal Court of Brazil, at a conciliation hearing held on May \n5th, at the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nVale’s 4.59% interest in Belo Monte is in line with its strategy to guarantee availability of electric \npower in the long term for its operations and in line with the Brazilian commitment to reduce \ngreenhouse gases emissions. \n\nIn March 2015, Vale transferred its 9% stake in Norte Energia Participações S.A. (the Belo \nMonte hydroelectric power plant) to Aliança Norte Energia Participações (Aliança Norte), a joint \nventure between Vale and Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nVale now indirectly holds a 4.59% interest in Belo Monte, while Cemig GT has a 4.41% stake in \nthe project through Aliança Norte. This reduction in Vale’s interest in Belo Monte is in line with \nits global strategy to focus on its core business, without harming the availability of electric power \nfor its operations. \n\nSince its entry into the Belo Monte project, Vale has hired professionals with extensive \nexperience in the implementation and operation of hydropower projects, especially in studies of \nenvironmental and socioeconomic impacts and indigenous issues. This allows Vale to track and \nverify that these issues are being addressed appropriately, from planning to execution of the \nproject, aiming at positive results and improving the quality and living conditions of the \ncommunities established in the region where the project is being built. \n\nThroughout its development, the plant design was deeply modified in order to restrict the impact \nof the activities on the environment and on the local population. The flooded area was reduced \nby 60 %, compared to the original design. The plant complex, including reservoirs, roads, \ntransmission lines, camps and other auxiliary structures, will occupy 559 Km2. Of this total, 156 \nkm2 (27%) needs to be deforested as the rest of the area consists of the riverbed and non-\nnative vegetation types, such as pastures, cultivated areas, and areas of mineral extraction. \n\nThe Belo Monte project has taken necessary precautions not to flood any indigenous lands and \nto avoid impacts in implementing the construction of sites, access roads, dam and other \nengineering structures needed to build the project. There are also no plans to resettle villages, \nin line with the project’s commitment to reduce its impacts on the surrounding area and local \ncommunities. \n\nDuring its implementation phase, the project is investing around R$4.23 billion in social and \nenvironmental initiatives, of which R$3.74 billion had been spent by March 2016 (88% of the \ntotal planned amount). The remaining disbursement will happen until 2019. \n\nThe management of social and environmental aspects is guided by the Basic Environmental \nPlan, which is being implemented through 117 programs, plans and projects, encompassing \nsocial, indigenous, land-related and physical-biotic investments, aimed at compensating for and \nmitigating the potential impacts identified in the environmental viability studies.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fSocial investments in local municipalities and indigenous communities represent around 60% of \nthe budget, covering social, cultural, economic and infrastructure aspects.  \n\nIn December 2015, about R $ 2.282 billion had been invested in social investments, being R$ \n497.83 million in health and sanitation, R$ 769,81 million in land acquisition and regularization, \nsocial communication, economic recovery for the population, preservation of cultural heritage \nand support for surrounding municipalities. \n\nThe modernization of the infrastructure of the city of Altamira was made, with the construction of \na linear park with 20 hectares, 7 new bridges in concrete and two pedestrian bridges. The entire \ncity waterfront was also revitalized with the construction of artificial beaches and structures for \nmarketing of fish and maintenance of vessels. \n\nWe highlight initiatives to monitor and improve health, education, training, income generation \nand appreciation of cultural and intangible heritage. Of these investments, 108 projects have \nbeen completed to build or renovate schools, benefiting 12,000 students from public education. \n\nIn the health area, 20 new primary health care units and a hospital with 104 beds were built and \nalready delivered to Altamira Prefecture. Until October 2015, R$ 5.220 million had been \ninvested in teams for the implementation of the Family Health Program (PSF). We highlight the \nstrategic investments to reduce cases of malaria in the region, achieving significant results with \nthe reduction of 99.1 % of recorded cases in the period from 2011 to 2015. \n\nIn the area of public safety, US$ 70 million were addressed to infrastructure and equipment \ninvestment through an agreement between Norte Energia and the Secretariat of Public Security \nof the State of Pará. \n\nAs part of social and environmental requirements related to the creation of Belo Monte’s \nreservoir, work is under way to comply with the National Solid Waste Plan, which has involved \nremediating existing dumps, completed in October 2012, and implementing sanitary landfills, in \noperation since early 2013, for the municipalities of Altamira and Vitória do Xingu, benefiting a \npopulation of approximately 120,000 people. \n\nAlso in 2013, work began on building these municipalities’ entire water and sewage systems, \ninvolving investments of around R$500 million and completed in late 2014, significantly \nimproving the way urban waste is disposed of in the region, where conditions used to be much \nworse than in Brazil as a whole. \n\nAs the reservoir is formed, the urban population previously living in areas of “palafitas” (houses \non stilts) in the city of Altamira has being resettled in new neighborhoods. R$ 727.36 million \nwere invested in the construction of five new neighborhoods with all sanitation infrastructure, \neducation and leisure in the city of Altamira, where the families living in the bayous region were \nrelocated.  \n\nThe implementation of the Basic Environmental Plan also involves actions for the physical-\nbioticenvironment, including research, monitoring and environmental conservation activities. \nThese mitigation and compensation initiatives include a Conservation Unit Implementation and \nManagement Action Support Project, an Action Plan to Conserve Endangered and Endemic \nFauna and Flora Species in the Lower and Middle Xingu Region, and an agreement with the \nChico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), encompassing more than 90 \nconservation initiatives. Other notable measures include the implementation of a tree nursery, \nthe restoration of degraded areas, water quality monitoring and control, and encouragement for \nsustainable fishing. \n\nTo meet the commitments provided for in the environmental licenses, the programs defined for \nthe Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous Component (PBA-CI), overseen by the National \nIndian  Foundation (FUNAI), establish thematic areas of activity that consider the indigenous \npeople’s expectations identified in consultation meetings held before the issuing of the \nenvironmental licenses. These programs cover Territorial Management, Special Indigenous \nPeople’s Health, Indigenous People’s School Education, Material and Intangible Cultural \nHeritage, Institutional Strengthening, Reallocation and Resettlement of Indigenous City Dwellers \nin Altamira, Environmental Supervision, Non-Indigenous Communication, and productive \nactivities involving a variety of subsistence and income-generation projects for indigenous \ncommunities.  \n\n \n \n\fThere is also an infrastructure program for villages in the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant’s \narea of influence, involving various works already executed, such as the following: Territorial \nProtection Units to support government actions to monitor indigenous lands; construction of an \nIndian House in Altamira to support indigenous village dwellers who are passing through the \ncity; landing strips to support aeromedical removals; highway renovation and maintenance; \nconstruction of flour mills; installation of a water supply and distribution system in villages \n(including artesian wells); and construction of sewage collection and treatment facilities. Work is \nalso under way to build schools and basic health facilities in the 34 villages located in the \nproject’s area of influence, besides other initiatives contained in the PBA-CI’s Operating Plan. \n\nIn programs for indigenous peoples, of the R $ 463.35 million expected to be invested by the \nend of 2016, more than R$ 287.7 million were already employed in the construction of 711 \nhouses, 34 basic health units , 29 water supplies systems, 21 airstrips and 34 houses for \nproduction of cassava flour in the villages. The Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous \nComponent benefits now about 3 500 indigenous residents of the villages located in the vicinity \nof the project. \n\nDuring the first two years, heavy investment was also made to support indigenous communities \nby donating a wide range of items, such as boats, boat engines, motor-generators, vehicles and \nfuel to support subsistence activities and cultural activities, as well as other items to improve the \npeople’s quality of life. \n\nThe project’s environmental licensing process also required the execution of initiatives to \ncontribute to governmental strategies for the socioeconomic development of the Xingu region. \nTo this end, in partnership with the state and federal governments, we highlight the Xingu \nRegional Sustainable Development Plan (PDRSX), which has a total budget of R$500 million. \nThis plan is aimed at implementing public policies in the following areas: Territorial Ordering and \nLand Use Regularization; Infrastructure; Promotion of Productive Sustainable Activities; Social \nInclusion; and a Management Model for Large Construction Projects. \n\nEnvironmental and social issues, among other strategic topics, are discussed by the \nEnvironmental Advisory Committee, whose members are appointed by Norte Energia’s \nshareholders. Vale, through Aliança Norte, appoints one representative to this committee and a \nrespective alternate member until the end of the Belo Monte hydroelectric project’s \nimplementation phase. Starting from the operational phase, Cemig GT and Vale will then \nalternately appoint their representative every three years. The committee’s main objective is to \nanalyze social and environmental subjects and recommend whether or not to approve \nmeasures to Norte Energia’s Board of Directors, which is composed of 12 members appointed \nby shareholders \n\nThrough Aliança Norte, Vale appoints one member and a respective alternate member to \nNorteEnergia’s Board of Directors, with the right to one vote at meetings, where subjects need \nto be approved by a vote of at least eight members. Vale and Cemig GT alternately appoint \nAliança Norte’s member of the Board of Directors every three years, as determined in Aliança \nNorte’s shareholders agreement. \n\nRegarding the media reports about the corruption scheme related to Belo Monte, as a result of \nthese allegations, Eletrobrás hired specialists to conduct an internal investigation on Norte \nEnergia. To date, there was no conclusive report. \n\nWe emphasize that the acquisition by Vale of stakes in the project occurred in 2011, a year after \nthe auction was done, and when the construction contracts were already signed.  \n\nVale´s administrator’s remuneration  \n\nUnder our bylaws, our shareholders are responsible for establishing the aggregate \ncompensation we pay to the members of our Board of Directors and our Board of Executive \nOfficers, and the Board of Directors allocates the compensation among its members and the \nBoard of Executive Officers. \n\nOur shareholders determine this annual aggregate compensation at the general shareholders’ \nmeeting each year.  In order to establish aggregate director and officer compensation, our \n\n \n \n \n \n\fshareholders usually take into account various factors, which range from attributes, experience \nand skills of our directors and executive officers to the recent performance of our operations.  \nOnce aggregate compensation is established, our Board of Directors is then responsible for \ndistributing such aggregate compensation in compliance with our bylaws among the directors \nand executive officers.  The Executive Development Committee makes recommendations to the \nBoard concerning the annual aggregate compensation of the executive officers.  In addition to \nfixed compensation, our executive officers are also eligible for bonuses and incentive payments. \n\nFixed compensation and in kind benefits include a base salary in cash, paid on a monthly basis, \nreimbursement for certain investments in private pension plans, health care, relocation \nexpenses, life insurance, driver and car expenses. \n\n Variable compensation consists of (i) an annual cash bonus, based on specific targets for each \nexecutive officer, approved by our Board of Directors, and (ii) payments tied to the performance \nof our shares under two programs, the Matching Program and the Performance Shares Units \n(PSU). \n\nProfit Sharing of Vale employees  \n\nThe Profit Sharing of employees is calculated based on individual and team results and on \ncompany's performance, having the cash flow and the spending on current investments as a \ntrigger. This indicator was below the set trigger, so there was no payment of Profit Sharing in \n2016. \n\nThe value of the trigger, measured by the cash generation indicator (Operating Cash Flow \nminus Current Investment), is $ 5.9 billion. As the value obtained was below the trigger, the \nProfit Sharing was zero. \n\nThe current model was created with the aim of strengthening the emphasis on meritocracy and \nmore accurately reflect the company's results. This methodology was negotiated and approved \nby the Unions through Collective Agreements signed in 2014, to take effect in 2014 and 2015. \n\nResources allocated for repairing and compensation of Samarco´s accident \n\nOn March 2nd, 2016, Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco) and its two shareholders, Vale S.A \n(Vale) and BHP Billiton Brasil LTDA (BHPB Brasil), have entered into an agreement with the \nFederal Government, represented by the Attorney General of Brazil, the States of Espírito \nSanto and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities (Brazilian Authorities) for the \nrestoration of the environment and communities affected by the Samarco dam failure on \nNovember 5th, 2015 (“Agreement”).  \n\nThe Agreement establishes the obligation for Samarco, Vale and BHPB to create a private \nfoundation, that will be responsible for implementing about 40 socio-economic and \nenvironmental programs to address the impacts of the accident. The document contains the \nemergency actions that have been conducted by Samarco since November, 2015, and \nproposes mid-term and long-term projects to remediate and compensate the impacts arising \nfrom the dam rupture. \n\nAccording to the Agreement, Samarco shall contribute to the Foundation the total amount of R$ \n4.4 billion, during its first three years, to fund the projects. From 2019 to 2021, annual \ncontributions to the Foundation will be set according to the annual implementation of the \nremaining planned remediation and compensation projects. The annual reference values for \nthese contributions will be between R $ 800 million and R$ 1.6 billion. In the following years, \nSamarco's contribution will be set on amounts sufficient for the execution of the remaining \nprojects of the programs established under the Agreement. To the extent Samarco does not \nmeet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil is liable in proportion to its 50 \nper cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSamarco accident and the Krenak \n\nSince 1997, Vale has established a relationship and support actions with the Indigenous People \nKrenak, when the group had its his territory officially established, boarding 6.5 km along the \nDoce River and the Estrada de Ferro Vitória Minas (EFVM), operated by Vale since 1940. \n\nIn November 2015, Vale started emergency additional support to the Indigenous People Krenak \nfocused on water supply among other inputs in order to minimize the immediate effects resulting \nfrom the Fundão Dam accident. Currently, Samarco is assuming the conduction of the actions \nrelated to the accident. \n\n \n \n \n\fRespostas em português  \n\nCausas do acidente da Samarco \n\nA barragem de Fundão, da mineradora Samarco, se rompeu na tarde de 5 de novembro de \n2015, no município de Mariana, em Minas Gerais, o que resultou no deslocamento de parte dos \nrejeitos de mineração ali depositados e no galgamento da barragem de Santarém. Não é \npossível, neste momento, confirmar as causas do ocorrido.  \n\nA Samarco abriu um canal para o público visando esclarecer, de forma transparente, todos os \ndetalhes sobre o caso. Acesse: http://bit.ly/Samarco. \n\nO acidente da Samarco e os resultados da Vale \n\nComo acionista da Samarco, juntamente com a BHP Billiton, a Vale tem promovido o suporte \ndas ações destinadas a garantir a integridade física, a segurança e os direitos fundamentais \ndas pessoas afetadas pelo acidente. Desde o primeiro dia, disponibilizamos recursos humanos \ne materiais para auxiliar a Samarco. No entanto, estas despesas não afetaram o resultado da \nVale de 2015, conforme informado no Relatório 20-F da companhia. \n\nÉ importante ressaltar que no Relatório 20-F de 2015 da Vale o seguinte risco foi relatado para \nos investidores: \n\n“Nossas obrigações nos termos do contrato de acordo decorrente da ruptura da \nbarragem da Samarco poderão ter um impacto substancial sobre nossa condição \nfinanceira \n\nA Samarco e seus acionistas, Vale e BHPB Brasil Ltda. (“BHPB”), uma subsidiária brasileira da \nBHP Billiton plc (“BHP Billiton”), firmaram um acordo no dia 2 de março de 2016 com órgãos \ngovernamentais, inclusive com a União Federal e com os dois Estados brasileiros afetados \npela ruptura da barragem (Espírito Santo e Minas Gerais). De acordo com o contrato, Samarco, \nVale e BHPB criarão uma fundação para desenvolver e implementar programas de \nrecuperação e compensação em valores substanciais ao longo de muitos anos.”  \n\n“Atualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, Vale e BHPB estarão \nobrigadas a alocar verbas para a fundação, proporcionais às suas respectivas participações \nacionárias de 50% na Samarco. A Vale não espera atualmente registrar uma provisão nas suas \ndemonstrações contábeis com relação a essas obrigações, mas se a Samarco for \neventualmente incapaz de retomar as operações ou cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, \npoderá vir a reconhecer eventual provisão.” \n\nAcordo firmado entre Samarco, Vale e BHP Billiton com a União e os governos de Minas \nGerais e do Espírito Santo  \n\nO acordo prevê ações de reparação e compensação de longo prazo para responder ao impacto \ndo acidente envolvendo a barragem da Samarco. Conforme os seus termos, a Samarco, a Vale \ne a BHP Billiton Brasil irão estabelecer uma fundação privada que será responsável pelo \ndesenvolvimento e execução dos programas ambientais e socioeconômicos de remediação e \ncompensação previstos naquele instrumento. \n\nAtualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. A Samarco e seus acionistas estão esperançosos que a Samarco seja capaz de \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fretomar as operações e gerar a totalidade ou uma parte substancial dos recursos necessários \nao cumprimento do acordo. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de aporte na fundação, \nVale e BHPB estarão obrigadas a alocar verbas para esse fim, proporcionais às suas \nrespectivas participações acionárias de 50% na Samarco.  \n\nO acordo foi homologado pela Justiça Federal brasileira, na audiência de conciliação realizada \nem 05 de maio de 2016 no Tribunal Regional Federal da 1ª Região. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nA participação de 4,59% na Hidrelétrica de Belo Monte é consistente com a nossa estratégia de \ngarantir fornecimento de energia elétrica no longo prazo para nossas operações e alinhada \ncom o compromisso brasileiro de redução de emissões de gases de efeito estufa. Em março de \n2015, a Vale transferiu a sua participação de 9% na Norte Energia Participações S.A (UHE \nBelo Monte) para a empresa Aliança Norte Energia Participações S.A. (Aliança Norte), joint \nventure formada entre a Vale e a Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nAtualmente a Vale detém, de forma indireta, a participação de 4,59% na Norte Energia (UHE \nBelo Monte) e a Cemig GT, por sua vez, detém 4,41% de participação em Belo Monte, através \nda Aliança Norte. Essa redução de participação em Belo Monte está em linha com a estratégia \nglobal da Vale de foco no seu core business, sem comprometer a disponibilidade de energia \npara suas operações. \n\nDesde a sua entrada no projeto de Belo Monte, a Vale contratou profissionais com vasta \nexperiência na implantação e operação de projetos hidrelétricos, especialmente em estudos de \nimpactos ambientais e socioeconômicos e questões indígenas. Isso nos permite acompanhar e \nverificar se esses assuntos estão sendo tratados de forma adequada desde o planejamento até \na execução do projeto, objetivando resultados positivos e a melhoria da qualidade e condição \nde vida das comunidades da região onde o projeto está sendo construído. \n\nAo longo de sua elaboração, o projeto da usina foi profundamente modificado com vistas a \nrestringir os impactos que poderiam acarretar ao meio ambiente e à população da região. A \nárea de inundação foi reduzida em 60% em comparação ao projeto original. O complexo da \nusina, que inclui reservatórios, estradas, linha de transmissão, acampamentos e outras \nestruturas auxiliares, ocupará 559 Km2. Deste total, será necessário desmatar 156 Km2 de \nfloresta (27%), porque o restante da área é composto pelo leito do rio e formações vegetais \nnão-nativas, como pastagens, áreas cultivadas, e áreas de extração mineral. \n\nO projeto de Belo Monte adotou todo o cuidado necessário para não inundar terras indígenas, \ne não ter impacto na implantação de canteiros de obras, pelas estradas de acesso, pela \nbarragem e demais estruturas de engenharia necessárias à construção do empreendimento. \nTampouco há previsão de realocação de aldeias, reafirmando o compromisso do projeto com a \nredução dos impactos sobre a área circundante e comunidades locais. \n\nDurante a fase de implantação, o projeto terá investimentos socioambientais de cerca de R$ \n4,23 bilhões, tendo sido investidos R$ 3,75 bilhões até março de 2016, representando 88% do \nvalor total previsto. Existe a previsão de desembolso do valor restante até 2019, quando se \nfinaliza a montagem das unidades geradoras da Casa de Força principal. A gestão dos \naspectos socioambientais é orientada pelo Plano Básico Ambiental (PBA), que se desdobra em \n117 programas, planos e projetos, englobando investimentos sociais, indígenas, fundiário e \nmeio físico-biótico, visando a compensação e mitigação dos impactos potenciais identificados \nnos estudos de viabilidade ambiental. \n\nOs investimentos sociais para os municípios e comunidades indígenas, localizados na região \ndo empreendimento, representam cerca de 60% do orçamento, englobando aspectos sociais, \nculturais, econômicos e de infraestrutura. Em dezembro de 2015 já haviam sido investidos \ncerca de R$ 2,282 bilhões em investimentos sociais, sendo R$ 497,83 milhões na área de \nsaúde e saneamento, R$ 769,81 milhões em ações de aquisição e regularização fundiária, \ncomunicação social, recomposição econômica para a população e preservação do patrimônio \ncultural e apoio aos municípios do entorno. Houve a modernização da infraestrutura da cidade \nde Altamira com a construção de um parque linear com área de 20 hectares, 7 novas pontes \nem concreto e 2 passarelas para pedestres. Toda a orla da cidade também foi revitalizada com \n\n \n \n \n \n\fa construção de praias artificiais e estruturas para comercialização do pescado e manutenção \ndas embarcações.. \n\nDestacam-se ações de controle e melhoria das condições de saúde, educação, capacitação, \ngeração de renda e valorização do patrimônio histórico cultural e imaterial. Destes \ninvestimentos foram concluídas 108 obras de construção e reforma de escolas, beneficiando \n12 mil alunos da rede pública de educação. Na área de saúde, 20 novas unidades básicas de \nsaúde e um hospital com 104 leitos construídos e já entregues à Prefeitura de Altamira, tendo \nsido investidos até outubro de 2015 R$ 5,220 milhões em equipes para implantação do \nPrograma de Saúde da Família (PSF). Destacam-se na área da saúde os investimentos \nestratégicos para redução dos casos de malária na região, alcançando resultados significativos \ncom a redução de 99,1% dos casos constatados da doença no período de 2011 a 2015. \n\nNa área da segurança pública, foram destinados, desde o início das obras, R$70 milhões em \ninfraestrutura e equipamentos através de convênio firmado entre a Norte Energia e a Secretaria \nde Segurança Pública do Estado do Pará. \n\nDentre as exigências socioambientais para formação do reservatório do aproveitamento \nhidrelétrico Belo Monte está em andamento o atendimento ao Plano Nacional de Resíduos \nSólidos, com a remediação dos atuais lixões, concluídos em outubro de 2012, e a implantação \nde aterros sanitários, em operação desde início de 2013, para os municípios de Altamira e \nVitória do Xingu, beneficiando uma população de aproximadamente 120.000 habitantes. \n\nAinda em 2013, iniciaram as obras de construção de todo o sistema de abastecimento de água \ne esgotamento e tratamento sanitário destes municípios, com investimentos da ordem de R$ \n500 milhões, concluídas no final de 2014, modificando significativamente o panorama atual das \ncondições gerais de destinação final de resíduos urbanos, que apresentam forte desvantagem \nem relação às condições a nível nacional. \n\nPara a formação do reservatório foi efetivada a realocação da população urbana das áreas de \npalafitas da cidade de Altamira, tendo sido investido R$ 727,36 milhões na construção de 5 \nnovos bairros com toda infraestrutura de saneamento, educação e lazer na cidade de Altamira, \n\nonde foram realocadas as famílias moradoras da região dos igarapés. A implantação do Plano \nBásico Ambiental (PBA) desenvolve ainda ações para o meio físico-biótico, com pesquisas, \nmonitoramentos e atividades de conservação ambiental. Dentre estas ações de mitigação e \ncompensação, destacam-se o Projeto de Apoio às Ações de Implantação e Manejo de Unidade \nde Conservação e o Plano de Ação para Conservação das Espécies da Fauna e Flora \nAmeaçadas e Endêmicas na Região do Baixo e Médio Xingu, convênio com o Instituto Chico \nMendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio), onde estão previstas mais de 90 ações \nconservacionistas. Cabe ainda ressaltar a implantação do Viveiro de Mudas, Recuperação de \nÁreas Degradadas, Monitoramento e Controle da Qualidade de Água e Incentivo e Apoio à \nPesca Sustentável. \n\nEm atendimento ao compromisso previsto nas licenças ambientais, os programas definidos \npara o Plano Básico Ambiental - Componente Indígena (PBA-CI), sob a orientação da \nFundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI), estabelecem eixos temáticos de atuação em que foram \nconsideradas as expectativas indígenas identificadas durante as reuniões de consultas prévias \nà emissão das licenças ambientais, incluindo os Programas de Gestão Territorial, Saúde \nEspecial Indígena, Educação Escolar Indígena, Patrimônio Cultural Material e Imaterial, \nFortalecimento Institucional, Realocação e Reassentamento dos Indígenas Citadinos de \nAltamira, Supervisão Ambiental, Comunicação Não Indígena, Programa de atividades \nprodutivas com diversos projetos de subsistência e geração de renda para as comunidades \nindígenas e o Programa de infraestrutura nas aldeias da área de influência da UHE Belo Monte \ncom diversas obras já executadas, como: Unidades de Proteção Territorial em apoio às ações \nde Governo para o monitoramento das terras indígenas, Construção da Casa do Índio em \nAltamira para apoiar os indígenas aldeados em trânsito na cidade, pistas de pouso para apoio \nnas remoções aeromédicas, reformas e manutenções em estradas, construções de casas de \nfarinha, de sistema de abastecimento e distribuição de água nas aldeias (poços artesianos), \ncaptação e tratamento sanitário, entre outras, assim como já em curso a construção de escolas \ne Unidades Básicas de Saúde nas 34 aldeias localizadas na área de influência do \nempreendimento e demais ações contidas no Plano Operativo do PBA do Componente \nIndígena. Em programas para povos indígenas, dos R$ 463,35 milhões previstos para serem \ninvestidos até o final de 2016 já foram empregados mais de R$ 287,7 milhões na construção de \n\n \n \n\f711 casas de moradias, 34 unidades básicas de saúde, 29 sistemas de abastecimentos de \nágua, 21 pistas de pouso e 34 casas para produção de farinha de mandioca nas aldeias. O \nPlano Básico Ambiental Indígena beneficia hoje cerca de 3,5 mil indígenas moradores das \naldeias localizadas no entorno do Projeto Belo Monte e que são atendidos pela Norte Energia. \n\nDurante os 02 primeiros anos houve também um grande investimento em apoio para as \ncomunidades indígenas com a doação de diversos itens como: embarcações, motores \nnáuticos, motores geradores, veículos, combustível em apoio nas suas atividades de \nsubsistência e atividades culturais e demais itens para o melhoramento da qualidade dessa \npopulação. \n\nConsidera-se ainda, no processo de licenciamento ambiental do empreendimento, o \ndesenvolvimento de ações que contribuam com estratégias governamentais para o \ndesenvolvimento socioeconômico da região do Xingu. Nesta direção, em parceria com os \ngovernos Estadual e Federal, destaca-se o Plano de Desenvolvimento Regional Sustentável do \nXingu (PDRSX), com orçamento total de R$ 500 milhões, que objetiva a implementação de \npolíticas públicas com eixos de ação para o Ordenamento Territorial e Regularização Fundiária, \nInfraestrutura, Fomento às Atividades Produtivas Sustentáveis, Inclusão Social e Modelo de \nGestão para Grandes Obras. \n\nAs questões ambientais e sociais, entre outros assuntos estratégicos, são tratadas no Comitê \nConsultivo Ambiental, onde os membros são nomeados por cada acionista. A Vale, através da \nAliança Norte, indica um representante no Comitê Consultivo Ambiental e seu respectivo \nsuplente, sendo essa indicação alternada com a Cemig GT, a partir da fase de operação, a \ncada período de 3 anos. O principal objetivo do Comitê Consultivo Ambiental é analisar as \nquestões socioambientais e recomendar a sua aprovação ou não ao Conselho de \nAdministração. O Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia é formado por 12 membros \nindicados pelos acionistas. A Vale, por sua vez, através da Aliança Norte, indica um membro e \nseu respectivo suplente, com direito a um voto nas reuniões do referido órgão, onde as \nmatérias são aprovadas a partir do voto afirmativo de, pelos menos, 8 membros. Além disso, a \nindicação do membro para o Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia, a ser feita pela \nAliança Norte, é alternada entre Vale e Cemig GT a cada período de 3 anos, conforme definido \nno Acordo de Acionistas da Aliança Norte. \n\nCom relação às notícias veiculadas na mídia sobre esquema de corrupção em Belo Monte, em \nfunção destas, a Eletrobrás contratou especialistas para os trabalhos de investigação na Norte \nEnergia. Nesta data ainda não há um relatório conclusivo emitido. Há expectativa de que o \nrelatório final seja emitido ainda em junho de 2016. \n\nRessaltamos que a aquisição pela Vale de participação no projeto ocorreu em 2011, um ano \napós o leilão, e em um momento em que os contratos do consórcio construtor já estavam \nfirmados. \n\nRemuneração da administração Vale \n\nDe acordo com nosso estatuto social, nossos acionistas são responsáveis por estabelecer a \nremuneração agregada que pagamos aos membros de nosso Conselho de Administração e \nnossa Diretoria, e o Conselho de Administração distribui a remuneração entre seus membros e \na Diretoria. \n\nNossos acionistas determinam esta remuneração agregada anual na assembleia de acionistas \na cada ano. A fim de estabelecer a remuneração agregada do membro do Conselho e do \nDiretor, nossos acionistas geralmente consideram vários fatores, que variam desde atributos, \nexperiência e competências de nossos membros do Conselho e Diretores ao desempenho \nrecente de nossas operações. Uma vez que a remuneração agregada é estabelecida, os \nmembros de nosso Conselho de Administração são, então, responsáveis por distribuir tal \nremuneração agregada, em cumprimento ao nosso estatuto social, entre os membros do \nConselho e Diretores. O Comitê Executivo de Desenvolvimento faz recomendações ao \nConselho a respeito da remuneração agregada anual dos Diretores. Além de uma \nremuneração fixa, nossos Diretores também podem receber pagamentos de bônus e \nincentivos. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fA remuneração fixa e os benefícios em espécie incluem um salário base em dinheiro, pago \nmensalmente, o ressarcimento de certos investimentos em planos de pensão privados, \nserviços de saúde, despesas de transferência, seguro de vida, motorista e despesas com \nautomóvel. \n\nA remuneração variável consiste em (i) uma gratificação anual em dinheiro, baseada nas metas \nespecíficas para cada diretor executivo, aprovada por nosso Conselho de Administração, e (ii) \npagamentos vinculados ao desempenho de nossas ações de acordo com dois programas, o \nPrograma de Matching e as Unidades de Desempenho de Ações (PSU). \n\nParticipação nos lucros e resultados de empregados Vale \n\nA Participação nos Lucros e Resultados (PLR) dos empregados é calculada a partir dos \nresultados do empregado e de sua equipe e do desempenho da empresa, tendo o fluxo de \ncaixa e o gasto em investimentos correntes como gatilho. Esse indicador ficou abaixo do \ngatilho estabelecido, por isso não houve pagamento de PLR em 2016. \n\nO valor do gatilho, medido pelo indicador de Geração de Caixa (Fluxo de Caixa Operacional \nmenos os Investimentos Correntes), é de US$ 5,9 bilhões. Como o valor obtido ficou abaixo do \ngatilho, a PLR ficou em zero. \n\nO atual modelo foi criado com o objetivo de reforçar a ênfase na meritocracia e refletir com \nmaior precisão os resultados da empresa. Este foi aprovado em 2014 e aplicado nos cálculos \nde PLR de 2015. \n\nRecursos alocados para a reparação e compensação do acidente da Samarco  \n\nSamarco,Vale e BHP Billiton assinaram, no dia 02 de março de 2016, um acordo com os \ngovernos Federal, dos Estados de Minas Gerais e do Espírito Santo e outras entidades nos \ntermos do qual foram estabelecidos programas para a adoção de medidas de recuperação \nsocial, ambiental e econômica dos municípios e pessoas atingidas pelo rompimento da \nbarragem de Fundão, ocorrido em 05 de novembro de 2015. \n\nO acordo prevê a criação de uma fundação de direito privado que ficará responsável pela \nimplantação desses programas (cerca de 40), os quais estão reunidos em duas principais \nfrentes de trabalho, uma socioeconômica e outra socioambiental. O documento também elenca \nas ações emergenciais que vêm sendo adotadas pela Samarco desde novembro e propõe \nprojetos de médio e longo prazo a serem implementados para endereçar os impactos do \nacidente. \n\nA Samarco deverá aportar na fundação o total de R$ 4,4 bilhões, durante os três primeiros \nanos, para custear os projetos previstos no acordo. De 2019 a 2021, as contribuições anuais \npara a fundação serão definidas de acordo com o orçamento anual previsto para os projetos e \nmedidas remanescentes de remediação e compensação. Os valores anuais de referência para \nessas contribuições ficarão entre R$ 800 milhões e R$ 1,6 bilhões. Nos anos seguintes, o \naporte da Samarco deverá ser em patamar suficiente para a execução dos projetos e medidas \nremanescentes dos programas estabelecidos no acordo. \n\nO acidente da Samarco e os Krenak \n\nDesde 1997, a Vale se relaciona e apoia o Povo Indígena Krenak, quando a etnia teve seu \nterritório demarcado, passando a fazer fronteira ao longo de 6,5 km com o Rio Doce e com a \nEstrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM), operada pela Vale desde 1940. \n\nEm novembro de 2015, a Vale entrou com apoio adicional de caráter emergencial ao Povo \nIndígena Krenak, voltado para o abastecimento de água e garantia de insumos para minimizar \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fos efeitos imediatos decorrentes do acidente da barragem do Fundão.  Atualmente, a própria \nSamarco vem assumindo a condução das ações relacionadas ao acidente junto aos Krenak."}

Este estudio concluy6 que los riesgos ambientales en el area\nestaban vinculados a la presencia de metales asociados a causas naturales y que eran las\ncaracteristicas geolégicas de Espinar las que influian en la calidad del agua.\n\nEn marzo de 2016, el Ministerio del Ambiente publicé un articulo observando que SENASA\n(Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agraria, una entidad técnica al interior del Ministerio de\nAgricultura) habia llevado a cabo estudios en Espinar investigando la relaci6n, de haberla, de\nlas muertes prematuras de ganado en el area circundante a la mina Tintaya-Antapaccay\ncomo resultado de su exposicién a altos niveles de metales pesados. Este estudio concluyé\nque no habia prueba que demostrara que estos animales habfan estado expuestos a altos\nniveles de metales pesados. Ademas, los resultados de la investigacién indicaban que la\nmortalidad del ganado en Espinar era reflejo de problemas con la crianza, la malnutricion y la\nfalta de cuidado y proteccidn de los animales contra parasitos internos y externos.\n\nEn noviembre. de 2016, los Ministerios de Energia y Minas y Salud y Agricultura y el\nViceministro de Transportes visitaron Espinar para realizar una presentacién con respecto a\nlas inversiones planificadas del gobierno en la regién. En cuanto a los metales pesados, el\nMinistro de Salud observ6 la falta de lineamientos en el Peri sobre el manejo de metales\npesados. El Ministerio de Salud esta realizando las coordinaciones para que un grupo de\nexpertos de la Organizacién Mundial de la Salud visiten Lima para colaborar en la\npreparacion de dichos lineamientos y para apoyar la implementaci6én de una evaluaci6n ante\nfla presencia de metales pesados, de haberlos, en la sangre de los miembros de las\ncomunidades locales.\n\nTintaya-Antapaccay conserva y recicla toda el agua utilizada en la operacién en el\nemplazamiento y no la descarga a los rios locales. No utilizamos o extraemos plomo,\narsénico o mercurio en nuestras operaciones. Nuestro desempefio ambiental esta sujeto a\nnumerosas auditorias internas y externas. Los organismos normativos peruanos, incluido\nOEFA, han tomado cientos de muestras y han desarrollado diversos programas de monitoreo\ncomo parte de sus facultades de auditoria en los ultimos afios y no han encontrado prueba\nde contaminacién.\n\nEn los ultimos afios, Tintaya-Antapaccay ha implementado diversos programas de monitoreo\nparticipativo con comunidades locales. Todas las actividades de monitoreo participativo y de\nla compafia a la fecha demuestran que Tintaya-Antapaccay opera en forma coherente con\nlas leyes peruanas y con nuestros estandares lideres en el sector. A la fecha, no se ha\nobtenido prueba de que las actividades de Tintaya-Antapaccay ocasionen contaminacién o\nque el aumento en el nivel de metales pesados encontrado en la sangre de algunos\nhabitantes obedezca a la operacion Tintaya-Antapaccay.

The external\naudits are undertaken by the Agency for Assessment and Environmental Control (OEFA).\nOEFA is part of the Ministry of Environment and was established in 2008 to ensure consistent\nenvironmental regulation across Peru.\n\nIn recent years, OEFA has taken hundreds of samples and have conducted several\nmonitoring programmes as part of their audit faculties. Their observations are investigated\nthrough an administrative legal procedure to determine if there has been an infraction of\nenvironmental laws or not.\n\nAll of our Peruvian assets engage regularly with OEFA.\n\nAllegations of environmental pollution and resulting health impacts\n\nWe strongly reject the allegations of environmental pollution being linked to our Tintaya-\nAntapaccay operation. All of our sites operate to industry-leading environmental standards\nand to our stringent sustainable development policies and standards. Our operations comply\nin full with or exceed all applicable environmental and social regulations. Our operations\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

This study concluded that the\nenvironmental risks in the area are linked to the presence of metals associated with natural\ncauses and that it is the geological characteristics of Espinar that influence the quality of\nwater.\n\nIn March 2016, the Ministry of Environment published an article observing that SENASA\n(National Service of Agrarian Health, a technical entity within the Ministry of Agriculture) had\nundertaken studies in Espinar investigating the relationship, if any, of the premature deaths of\nlivestock in the area surrounding Tintaya-Antapaccay mine as a result of being exposed to\nhigh levels of heavy metals. This study concluded that there was no evidence showing that\nthese animals were exposed to high levels of heavy metals. Additionally, the results of the\nresearch indicated that livestock mortality in Espinar reflected problems with breeding, poor\nanimal nutrition and a lack of care and protection against external and internal parasites.\n\nIn November 2016, the Ministers of Energy and Mines, Health and Agriculture and the vice-\nminister of transportation visited Espinar to present on planned government investments in\nthe region. With respect to heavy metals, the Minister of Health noted the absence of a\nguideline in Peru on the management of heavy metals. The Ministry of Health is arranging for\na group of experts from the World Health Organisation to visit Lima to assist in the\npreparation of such guidelines and to support the implementation of an assessment on the\npresence, if any, of heavy metals in the blood of local community members.\n\nTintaya-Antapaccay retains and recycles all water used in the operation on-site and does not\ndischarge into local rivers. We do not use, or mine, lead, arsenic or mercury at our operations.\nOur environmental performance is subject to numerous internal and external audits. Peruvian\nregulatory organisations, including OEFA, have taken hundreds of samples and conducted\nseveral monitoring programmes as part of their audit faculties in recent years and found no\nevidence of pollution.\n\nIn recent years, Tintaya-Antapaccay has implemented a number of participatory monitoring\nprogrammes with local communities. All participatory and company monitoring activities to\ndate demonstrate that Tintaya-Antapaccay operates in line with Peruvian law and our\nindustry-leading standards. To date, there has been no evidence that Tintaya-Antapaccay’s\nactivities causes pollution or that the increased level of heavy metals found in the blood of\nsome inhabitants is due to the Tintaya-Antapaccay operation. The site will, of course,\nconsider any additional requests for further independent monitoring.\n\nWe aim to secure broad-based support for our activities and Tintaya received overwhelming\ncommunity support in the public consultation for the Antapaccay expansion project’s\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment.\n\n2012 social unrest\n\nDespite Tintaya-Antapaccay's attempt to maintain a dialogue with the municipal authorities\nand reach a peaceful solution, as well as the national government's prior agreement to\nconduct further intensive joint environmental monitoring in the province, protests went ahead\nin Espinar in May 2012, outside of the Tintaya-Antapaccay area of operation. At the time the\nTintaya-Antapaccay operation was owned and operated by Xstrata.\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

They also help to \ncreate stable sourcing markets and sustainable economic growth in these countries. Our \nSustainability Commitment (previously our Code of Conduct) requires that all of our suppliers \nrespect the right to freedom of association. \n\nTo further push the development forward when it comes to social dialogue and industrial relations, \nwe signed a Global Framework Agreement, GFA, with the global trade union IndustriALL and the \nSwedish Trade Union IF Metall in November 2015. The GFA was converted into a permanent \ncollaboration in September 2016. \n\nThe collaboration promotes freedom of association where workers’ representatives have a voice and \nwhere trade unions can negotiate and bargain collectively. The goal is to create a well-functioning \ndialogue between employer and employees at the factories so that conflicts are solved peacefully \nand primarily at the factory level where they arise. We have also launched projects in several \ncountries, including in Bangladesh, aiming at improving social dialogue and industrial relations \nthrough awareness raising and capacity building. \n\nFor more information on how we work on improving industrial relations see our Sustainability \nReport 2016: \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/content/dam/hm/about/documents/en/CSR/2015%20Sustainability%20report/H\nM_SustainabilityReport_2015_final_FullReport_en.pdf \n\nPlease find our answers to your questions here: \n\n1.

In the letter we expressed our shared concern over the detention of individuals with \nunion affiliation and workers’ rights advocates. We requested the government to take steps to \nensure the protection of the workers’ rights, with special attention to the representatives of the \nworkers arrested. We stressed that labour rights related to freedom of association must be fully \nrespected, and that the root cause of the unrest must be addressed through improved industrial \nrelations. \n\nWe remain in continuous dialogue with relevant global and local stakeholders, such as trade \nunions, the industry association BGMEA, other brands, as well as with involved suppliers. We are \ncurrently considering which further appropriate actions are to be taken. \n\n2.  Whether H&M has required their supply chains to reinstate all factory workers suspended or \n\nfired related to the Ashulia protests? \n\nWe closely followed the negotiations between factory management, trade union representatives \nand the industry association Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association \n(BGMEA) regarding the terms for the dismissed workers.

Total's position. \n\nTotal  is  and  acts  in  favor  of financial  transparency.  To  illustrate  this  commitment,  Total  joined \nthe  Extractive  Industry  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI)  from  its  inception,  as  it  believes that this \nvoluntary  and  multi-stakeholder  initiative  is  more  effective  than  reliance  on  more  national \nregulations. \n\nIn 2013,  the  European  Union  issued  a  Directive  (Accounting  Directive  2013/34/EU)  requiring \nEuropean companies active in the extractive industries to  publish an  annual report  on  payments \nmade  to  producing  countries.  Similar  reporting  obligations  currently  exist  in  Canada  and \nNorway. \n\nTotal  considers  that  the  re-introduction  of  Rule  13q-1  under the  Dodd  Frank  Act should  both \nrestore  a  level  playing  field  among  major  publicly-listed  oil  and  gas  companies  and  improve \ntransparency to  help combat global  corruption  and  increase accountability. \n\nTotal  recognizes  that  the  SEC  positively  answers  its  concerns  by  proposing  to  adopt  an \napproach similar to  European transparency legislation. Furthermore,  the SEC's  proposal would \nallow  foreign \nissuers  already  reporting  payments  to  producing  countries  to  meet  the \nrequirements  of  the  commission's  proposed  rules  if the  foreign  rules  were  determined  by  the \ncommission to  be substantially similar to the rule adopted under Section 13(q). \n\nTotal believes equivalency recognition should  help global transparency initiatives evolve toward \nIt \na  common  standard,  thereby  improving  the  quality  and  comparability  of  information. \nencourages  foreign  jurisdictions  that  have  not  yet  adopted  resource  extraction  payment \ndisclosure  laws  to  provide  a  level  of  disclosure  that  is  consistent  with  U.S.  and  EU  rules. \nTherefore, Total considers  it important that the  SEC  substantially adopt  its currently  proposed \nrules in final  form  and, quickly thereafter, unilaterally make a determination of the equivalency of \nEU rules as transposed by the Member States of the European Union into their  national laws. \n\nAdresfce  postale : 2  place Jean Millier - La  Defense 6  - 92078 Paris La  Defense Cedex \nTel. + 33 (0)  1 47 44 45 46 \n\nTOTAL S.A. \nSociete Anonyme au capital de 6  096 470 692,50 euros \nSiege social: 2  place Jean Millier - La  Defense 6  - 92400 Courbevoie - France \n542 051  180 RCS  Nanterre"}

It conducted an extensive \nEnvironment and Social Impact Assessment and separately conducted a High Conservation Value \nassessment, which was used to inform the IndoMet Coal Biodiversity Strategy. \nIn addition, prior to the commencement of the small 1mtpa Haju Mine, a formal Environmental and \nSocial Impact Assessment (AMDAL) process was undertaken consistent with Indonesian law but \nwhich additionally: \no \n\nidentified key environmental and social impacts so that appropriate management and \nmonitoring plans could be developed;  \n\no  engaged NGOs to identify environmental and social impacts and opportunities and, where \n\no \n\npossible, include them in plan development; and  \ninvolved extensive community and government engagement to seek local support and licence \nto operate for the project. \n\n  Additional risk assessments covering various scopes and disciplines (including health, safety, \n\nenvironment and community) were conducted during BHP Billiton’s ownership of IndoMet Coal \nand informed the strategies and controls that were implemented during each project phase.   \n\nConsultation process \n\nA.  Haju and Lampunut:  \n\n  Through BHP Billiton’s Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement, BHP Billiton commits to the 2013 \n\nICMM Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining that sets out standards for engaging \nwith Indigenous Peoples with respect to new operations or major capital projects that are located \non lands traditionally owned by or under customary use of Indigenous Peoples and are likely to \nhave significant adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples. \n\n  The 2013 Position Statement’s requirements apply to new operations or major capital projects for \n\n \n\nwhich permitting and approvals had not commenced prior to May 2015.  \nIn relation to Haju and Lampunut, those projects received the majority of official approvals (for \nexample mining tenure, AMDAL, forestry permits) prior to both the agreement of the  Position \n\nA member of the BHP Billiton Group which is headquartered in Australia, Registered Office: Level 16, 171 Collins Street Melbourne Victoria 3000 Australia, \nABN 49 004 028 077 Registered in Australia \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fStatement by ICMM in 2013 and the effective date of adoption of the Position Statement by ICMM \nMember Companies in May 2015. \n\nB.  Engagement processes adopted at IndoMet Coal: \n\n  Nevertheless, IndoMet Coal worked closely with directly affected villages and had extensive \n\nengagement systems including community consultation workshops and development \nprogrammes. Engagement activities included:  \no  a range of formal community consultation meetings;  \no  close engagement with the Dayak Council (the tribal governing body for local Indigenous \n\ncommunities);  \n\no  extensive and frequent informal engagement with local communities and individuals (including \n\nIndigenous communities);  \n\no  anthropological studies and investigations; \no  between 2012 and 2016, IndoMet Coal conducted 35 formal communication sessions with \n\nlocal communities and 900 informal community meetings; \n\no  environmental and social impact assessments (including the AMDAL process described \n\nabove);  \no \nincorporating community feedback from these consultation processes into project designs;  \no  undertaking cultural heritage clearances (in conjunction with local communities) prior to land \n\no \n\nclearing and construction work;  \nimplementing a range of community development programmes, developed in consultation with \nlocal communities; and  \nimplementation of grievance mechanisms and compensatory action processes.  \n  These communication processes were implemented consistently in the Haju area for over 10 \n\no \n\n \n\nyears. \nIn 2005, IndoMet Coal commissioned a series of community based participatory rural appraisals \nwhich were undertaken by anthropologists and development NGOs.  This process resulted in the \ndevelopment of village based community consultation forums known as HAPAKAT. \n\nC.  Application of the 2013 ICMM Position Statement to future projects within IndoMet Coal: \n\n  Prior to the decision to sell IndoMet Coal, BHP Billiton analysed the 2013 ICMM Position \nStatement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining to assess whether it could be effectively \nimplemented in Indonesia. That analysis showed that significant differences existed between the \n2013 ICMM Position Statement and Indonesia’s regulatory system, where Indigenous Peoples’ \nrights are not based on self-identification and are only enlivened if recognised by the State.  \n  Consistent with implementing the commitments of the ICMM Position Statement, BHP Billiton’s \n\nplan for addressing these differences in future IndoMet Coal projects focused on: \no  Reviewing the community engagement and consensus-building work done by IndoMet Coal to \n\nconsider how it exceeded local requirements and substantially complied with the 2013 ICMM \nPosition Statement commitments. \n\no  Considering any additional steps IndoMet Coal could take (for future projects in Indonesia), \nwhich were identified through further analysis of the 2013 ICMM Position Statement and the \nIndonesian regulatory framework. For example, IndoMet Coal: \n\no \n\ninvestigated the type of consent that it could seek from the Indigenous local \ncommunity in accordance with Dayak traditional law; \n\no  was committed to reviewing its Complaints and Grievance procedure to ensure it was \n\nparticipatory and inclusive for Dayak peoples. \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fMalnutrition in the local community \n\n  At the time BHP Billiton sold its remaining share of IndoMet Coal to Adaro, the total disturbed area \nof the Muara Tuhup Port, Haju Mine and Lampunut early works was approximately 300 hectares.  \n\n  BHP Billiton is not aware of any evidence that the development of IndoMet Coal had caused \n\nmalnutrition in children, by materially decreasing access to food, or that traditional trees for \nmedicine or cultural practices could not be sourced.  \n\n  There are a number of other coal mines in close proximity to the Haju Mine that have disturbed \n\nmuch larger areas of forest.  \n\n  Much of the land area covered by IndoMet Coal’s coal contracts of work were also covered by \nactive timber concessions.  Under the terms of the mining concession IndoMet Coal had no \ncontrol over the activities of the timber concession holders.  \n\nTransfer to Adaro \n\n  BHP Billiton developed IndoMet Coal in line with BHP Billiton’s sustainability values and to \ninternational standards.  This covered exploration, design, construction and operation.   \n  BHP Billiton carried out extensive joint-venture partner due diligence when it sold an initial 25 \n\npercent interest in IndoMet Coal to Adaro in 2010. \n\n  All of the studies, infrastructure designs, procedures and strategies prepared for IndoMet Coal \n\nwere transferred to Adaro.   \n\n  Over 75 percent of the IndoMet Coal workforce who developed and executed these systems \n\ntransitioned to employment with Adaro.   \n\n  We believe we have provided Adaro with the systems and procedures, information, capacity and \n\nexpertise required to enable IndoMet Coal to continue to operate consistently with international \nstandards. \n\n3"}

We believe the \nopposite to be true. We have stepped outside the normal boundaries of what would be expected \nof any buyer to help resolve this case – given the fact that we held no active or ongoing \nrelationship with PDB.  \n\nWe had no orders with PDB at the time the workers went on strike in July 2012, or at the time \nwhen they lost their employment, or at any time thereafter, up until the factory closed in \nJanuary 2014. CCC are fully aware that throughout the period in question the factory was \nmaking products for another sporting goods company, not adidas. Despite this fact, we stepped \nforward, based on our long-standing relationship with the union’s parent federation, to \nencourage an early resolution of the dispute. Those efforts were both extensive, and continuous. \nFor example:  \n\n  We monitored the strike activities and on several occasions GSBI came to our offices to \n\nbrief us on their demands and PDB’s response. Based on those briefings it was reported \nthat PDB had agreed to meet the workers’ demands for full payment of the minimum \nwages, but the factory would not agree to union’s call for reinstatement of Ms Kokom \nKomalawati, whose redundancy case had already been reviewed and dismissed by the \nManpower Department;  \n\n  When the strike continued into its second week, we reached out to PDB and encouraged \nthem to extend the deadline for workers to return to work, i.e. beyond the 7 days’ legal \nlimit, to allow for additional time to resolve the dispute;    \nIn the aftermath of the strike, we consulted with Manpower Department officials, the ILO \nand sought independent advice from an industrial relations lawyer and shared this \nfeedback with both Panarub and GSBI;  \n\n \n\n  We facilitated the appointment of an independent third party, to mediate between the \n\nparties and after that mediation failed, we continue to urge both parties to negotiate and \nreach a mutual agreement to resolve their dispute; and, finally,  \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n\f  We spoke with GSBI on multiple occasions advising them that if they were unable to \n\nsecure a favourable outcome through negotiate with PDB they should to take the case to \ncourt for final resolution.  \n\nAlthough there was no legal impediment placed on GSBI-SBGTS, the union chose not to \nexercise its right to seek a judicial review of the lawfulness of the factory’s decision (to treat \nworkers as having resigned for failure to return to work in due time) and after 2 years of \ninaction those rights lapsed. Instead, the union chose another route to address this issue and in \nFebruary 2015 GSBI lodged a complaint directly with the ILO Committee on Freedom of \nAssociation in Geneva.  \n\nThe ILO Committee has now deliberated and delivered its conclusions and a remedy: it has \ncalled on the Indonesian government to hold a formal inquiry to reach a decision on the legality \nof the strike, based on which the appropriate level of compensation due to the workers can then \nbe determined.  \n\nWe continue to engage with all parties and in recent months we have met with the Indonesian \nMinistry of Manpower on two separate occasions to formally request that they complete an \nindependent review and make a legal determination over the payment of severance. Only a final \nand legally binding decision will resolve these long outstanding claims. \n\nWe would ask your readers view the full statement we have placed on our website, which CCC \nhas also kindly included a link to at the end of their statement.  \n\nSee: https://www.adidas-group.com/media/filer_public/69/1d/691d6520-d1f9-4549-8a94-\n744dc49ab6ca/adidas_response_to_clean_clothes_campaign_open_letter_on_panarub_dwikar\nya.pdf  \n\nFinally, and for clarity, in CCC’s latest posting they have alleged that: “For years prior to the \n2012 strike, the workers at the PDK factory, most of them women, experienced abusive and \nunlawful working conditions ...” We disagree with this very negative portrayal of working \nconditions at PT Panarub Dwikarya Benoa. For the 19 months that adidas held a business \nrelationship with the factory it was subject to regular audit visits and worker interviews. None of \nmonitoring records or worker feedback show any evidence of systematic verbal or physical \nabuse, as alleged by the CCC. \n\nSincerely, \n\nWilliam Anderson \nVice President  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs \nAsia Pacific \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

Our products are made by independent suppliers, based \nin many countries across the world, including several in Europe. Regardless of a supplier’s \ngeographical location, all our 1st tier suppliers (product manufacturers and the processing factories \nsubcontracted by them) must sign our Sustainability Commitment if they want to start or continue \nworking with us. The Sustainability Commitment is shared by all brands within the H&M group, and \namong other areas clearly expresses the fundamental expectations, or minimum requirements, our \nsuppliers need to meet to start or continue doing business with the H&M group. These fundamental \nrequirements include payment of legally required minimum wages, or wages agreed upon in a \ncollective bargaining agreement, whichever is higher. For details please see our Sustainability \nCommitment (wage requirements on page 4): \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/content/dam/hm/about/documents/en/CSR/Sustainability%20Commit\nment/Sustainability%20Commitment_en.pdf \n\nThe Sustainability Commitment is applicable to, and signed by, all H&M suppliers, in Europe as well \nas in other parts of the world. For a full list of our suppliers please see our public supplier list: \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/en/sustainability/downloads-resources/resources/supplier-list.html \n\nOur Sustainability Commitment is complemented by the SIPP, our Supplier Impact Partnership \nProgramme. The Sipp supports suppliers in improving their sustainability performance and helps us \nmonitor and measure suppliers’ compliance against our Sustainability Commitment, including the \nminimum requirements on wages therein. Academics and external stakeholders were widely \nconsulted before launching Sipp. \n\nThrough SIPP we ask our suppliers to self-report data on multiple topics. This data is later validated \nby our developers and capacity plans are set up where needed. Factory performances on \nmanagement systems on social and environmental areas are measured. All factories submit their \nannual performance by filling in the Higg facility module, developed by the Sustainable Apparel \nCoalition, which is one of the largest organisations in the industry, comprising 40% of the retail \nindustry on apparels and footwear. \n\nThis focus on systems and sustainability does not necessarily mean that we are visiting our suppliers \nless frequently, and we still always assure compliance with our minimum requirements, including \nthose on payment on legal wages. However, we focus our resources on visits based on capacity \nbuilding needs and risk assessments. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIf a supplier is found to be violating our minimum requirements we have a system in place that \nenables us to give the appropriate consequences to the supplier. If a supplier is failing to meet our \nminimum requirements we place the factory “on-hold”. The factory then submits an action plan, \nwork on their issues and before they are approved we visit them to make sure they are in \ncompliance. Minimum requirement violations will result in business consequences and repeated \nviolations will result in a termination of the business relationship and phase out of the factory. \n\nAgain, the SIPP assessment method, just as the expectations outlined in our Sustainability \nCommitment, which are measured through SIPP, apply equally to all H&M group’s suppliers \nregardless of where in the world the manufacturing of our products is taking place. This means that a \nsupplier in Bangladesh as well as in Romania, who is found not to be paying legally required wages to \nthe employees, will be subject to above mentioned procedures. For more info on our Sustainability \nCommitment and the SIPP method please see page 99 onwards in our 2016 Sustainability Report: \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/content/dam/hm/about/documents/en/CSR/Report%202016/HM_gro\nup_SustainabilityReport_2016_StandardsAndPolicies_en.pdf \n\nH&M \n\nStockholm, Sweden \n\n2017-12-11"}

Below you will find a brief description of our \ngeneral approach to fair wages - which is the central issue in the CCC report – and an \nexplanation of the wage-setting processes we have pursued in Georgia and the Ukraine.  \n\nGeneral Approach \n\nAt adidas we are committed to ensuring fair labour practices, fair wages and safe and \nenvironmental friendly working conditions throughout our global supply chain. With respect to \nour suppliers, we follow a well-developed and progressive Fair Compensation Strategy.  \n\nOur Fair Compensation Strategy requires that we:  \n\n1.  do not infringe on the rights of workers, their employers and governments to set fair wages \n\nas a minimum;  \n\n2.  conduct due diligence and act when business partners are not compliant with the law or our \n\nWorkplace Standards; and,  \n\n3.  facilitate positive wage progression and fair wages in our supply chain.  \n\nThe idea of a living wage is that workers and their families are able to afford a basic, but decent, \nstandard of living that is considered acceptable by society at its current level of economic \ndevelopment.  Fair compensation goes deeper. It considers the fairness of the wage that a \nworker is paid by benchmarking whether wages: are paid regularly and on time, include the \nlegal minimum, allow decent living standards, reflect a worker’s performance and skills, \nreward overtime, follow price increases paid for the products they are making, are linked to \ntheir employer’s profits and sales, reflect changes in work technology, are negotiated \nindividually or collectively with workers, are clearly and formally communicated to workers. \n\nAs a responsible business, we do not want the workers employed in our supply chain to face \nhardship in their daily lives. Our aspiration, as set out in the core principles of our Workplace \nStandards, is that workers earn enough for their basic needs and also have income remaining to \ncover their discretionary spending as well as savings. We seek business partners who \nprogressively raise employee living standards through improved wage systems, benefits, \nwelfare programmes and other services which enhance quality of life.  \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWages in Eastern Europe \n\nWe have sought to address and improve supplier wages in Eastern Europe through wage \nassessments and in-country collaborations. To illustrate this, we have set out below our \napproach to wage-setting in Ukraine and Georgia; two of the countries highlighted in CCC’s \n‘Made in Europe’ report. \n\nSeveral years ago, a decision was taken to source apparel from Georgia. This triggered a due \ndiligence process, which considered working conditions and wages in the country. Our pre-\nproduction risk assessment flagged that the legal minimum wage had not been updated by the \ngovernment since 1996. That was unacceptable to us and we reached out to other brands \nactively sourcing in Georgia, and to the FLA, to help us define a decent wage for our prospective \nsuppliers. The pool of stakeholders was further expanded to include the American Embassy, \nGeorgian Ministry of Labour, Georgian Ministry of Economics, ILO, and the trade union \nconfederations in the country. The final outcome was the fixing of an industry wage for our \nnewly onboarding suppliers, which was 12 times higher than the government-mandated \nminimum wage. To complement these actions, we also offered guidance to the Ministry of \nLabour on ways to improve the national labour law and provided training to their labour \ninspectors, again in collaboration with ILO, FLA and other leading brands.  \n\nWe have conducted a similar wage benchmarking exercise in the Ukraine. Our focus on wages \nin Ukraine was triggered by the introduction of a new military tax and currency fluctuations \n(primarily devaluation) due to unrest in the country. We reached out to the Ukrainian statistics \noffice to obtain nationwide wage data and, in parallel, conducted wage surveys in each of our \npartner’ factories. From the combined data, we created a wage map. The mapping showed that \nour manufacturing partners were already paying a prevailing industry wage, one that was \nsignificantly higher than the legal minimum wage. The research also confirmed that our \nsuppliers had taken it upon themselves to absorb the costs of a mandatory ‘war tax’ that was \nbeing levied against employees. They did so, to safeguard the workers’ take-home pay.  \n\nWe trust these examples demonstrate the positive approach we take to the question of fair \nwages in our supply chain in Eastern Europe. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President  \nSocial and Environmental Affairs \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

We share the concerns raised in the report and we are sorry if our \nanswers to the organizations behind the report were perceived as too general or brief. We are very \ncommitted to our continuous work both around the labour conditions in textile factories and living \nconditions at hostels, but at the same time aware of and frustrated over that the work to identify, \npush and understand how we and other brands can and should influence to make lasting change is \nnot moving fast enough.  \n\nThe report clearly shows there is a need for improved recruitment processes and a clearer \ncommunication making all inter-state migrant workers understand their rights and responsibilities. \nAnother challenge is the language barrier between workers and management at the workplace, \nmaking the interstate migrant workers more exposed than other workers. We are also aware of the \nvulnerability of textile workers living at hostels. This is the reason why we last year reached out to \nsuppliers in India to reinforce our expectation that the “Guidance for Migrant Women Workers in \nHostels” is followed, developed by the brands group in India (BEWG) together with trade unions, \nNGO’s and manufacturers. The guide aims at providing safe and healthy accommodation to migrant \nworkers. H&M inspects all hostels provided by our suppliers to make sure they meet expected \nstandards. We inspect the premises and conduct interviews with the workers living there. We also \ncheck the buildings from a general building maintenance perspective, the cleanliness of the premises \nas well as what kind of safety restrictions the workers have to comply with. \n\nBut even if the hostels fulfill our requirements as well as national law, there can still be challenges \nthat need to be handled. One such challenge concerns the balance between keeping the workers \nsafe and the freedom of movement. Last year we had discussions with several suppliers and their \nhostels about the curfew restrictions for female workers during their Sunday off and can now see \nchanges taking place. The women now have full freedom to leave hostels as they please during \ndaytime on Sundays, but there will still be checks when coming and going for safety reasons. Since \nthe interview material used in the report refers back to 2016, and activities addressing this have \nbeen performed during 2017, some changes such as this might not have been recognized. \n\nSince we are aware of and concerned by challenges connected to living conditions in the Bangalore \ngarment factory hostels, and working conditions at factories, we will arrange a workshop in the \nbeginning of 2018, together with Ethical Trade Initiative, where the trade unions GLU and GATWU \nalso are invited, to discuss updated and improved hostel guide lines, how to prevent and address \nsexual harassment and the assimilation of interstate migrant workers. One goal is to make sure \nsuppliers provide the migrant workers with supportive services in order to ensure their concerns are \naddressed, both connected to the workplace and the living conditions in general. \n\nSincerely, \nJonah Wigerhäll \nSustainability Business Expert"}

PT Panarub Dwikarya Benoa  (PDB) \n\nThank you for providing adidas with an opportunity to respond to the Clean Clothes Campaign’s (CCC’s) \nrecent press release, announcing its intention to file a complaint against adidas, for an alleged breach of \nthe OECD MNC guidelines and for “failing to provide access to remedy to 327 workers from their \nIndonesian shoe supplier Panarub.”  \n\nWe see no justifiable grounds for such a complaint. Nevertheless, we are happy to share with the NCP \nour efforts and actions to date to seek remedies and to assist the parties resolve their longstanding \ndispute. Those efforts are well documented and have featured in past responses posted on the BHRRC \nsite, in statements published on our corporate website (see, for instance, our lengthy statement at:  \nhttps://www.adidas-group.com/media/filer_public/69/1d/691d6520-d1f9-4549-8a94-\n744dc49ab6ca/adidas_response_to_clean_clothes_campaign_open_letter_on_panarub_dwikarya.pdf) \nand in correspondence with the CCC. \n\nThe NCP complaint repeats an earlier claim by CCC (dating from September 2017) that adidas had \nneglected its responsibility to address human rights violations in this case or to create the necessary \nleverage to resolve this long-standing dispute. We believe the opposite to be true. We have stepped \noutside the normal boundaries of what would be expected of any buyer to help resolve this case – given \nthat we held no active or ongoing relationship with PDB, which had operated as a subcontractor to our \nmain shoe manufacturing partner, PT Panarub.  \n\nWe had no orders with PDB at the time the workers went on strike in July 2012, or at the time when they \nlost their employment, or at any time thereafter, up until the factory closed in January, 2014. CCC are \nfully aware that throughout the period in question the factory was making products for another sporting \ngoods company, not adidas. Despite this fact, we stepped forward, based on our long-standing \nrelationship with the union’s parent federation, to encourage an early resolution of the dispute. Those \nefforts were both extensive, and continuous.  \n\nFor example:  \n\n-  We monitored the strike activities and on several occasions GSBI came to our offices to brief us \n\non their demands and PDB’s response. Based on those briefings it was reported that PDB had \nagreed to meet the workers’ demands for full payment of the arrears in the minimum wages to \nworkers, but the factory would not agree to union’s call for reinstatement of Ms. Kokom \nKomalawati, whose redundancy case had already been reviewed and found lawful by the \nManpower Department;  \n\n-  When the strike continued into its second week, we reached out to PDB and encouraged them to \nextend the deadline for workers to return to work, i.e. beyond the 7 days’ legal limit, to allow for \nadditional time to resolve the dispute;  \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f- \n\nIn the aftermath of the strike, we consulted with Manpower Department officials, the ILO and \nsought independent advice from an industrial relations lawyer and shared this feedback with both \nPanarub and GSBI;  \n\n-  We facilitated the appointment of an independent third party, to mediate between the parties and \nafter that mediation failed, we continue to urge both parties to negotiate and reach a mutual \nagreement to resolve their dispute; and, finally,  \n\n-  We spoke with GSBI on multiple occasions advising them that if they were unable to secure a \n\nfavourable outcome through negotiations with PDB they should to take the case to court for final \nresolution.  \n\nAlthough there was no legal impediment placed on GSBI-SBGTS, the union chose not to exercise its right \nto seek a judicial review of the lawfulness of the factory’s decision (to treat workers as having resigned \nfor failure to return to work in due time) and after 2 years of inaction those rights lapsed. Instead, the \nunion chose another route to address this issue and in February 2015 GSBI lodged a complaint directly \nwith the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in Geneva.  \n\nThe ILO Committee has now deliberated and delivered its conclusions and a remedy: it has called on the \nIndonesian government to hold a formal inquiry to reach a decision on the legality of the strike, based on \nwhich the appropriate level of compensation due to the workers can then be determined.  Since April, \n2017 we have met with the Indonesian Ministry of Manpower on three separate occasions and have also \nwritten to them, formally, to request that they complete an independent review and make a legal \ndetermination over the payment of severance. It is our belief, that only a final and legally binding decision \nwill resolve these long outstanding claims.  \n\nThe two parties involved in this case have remained polarized and largely unyielding, despite adidas’ early \nintervention, our facilitation of a mediation process immediately after the strike, and our engagement in \nthe years that have followed. We are now placing our trust in the Indonesian Ministry of Manpower to act \non the ILO’s recommendations and for the sake of the workers, and their long overdue payments, to \ndefine a settlement package that is acceptable to both Panarub and the union. We understand that in the \ncoming week the Indonesian government will meet with the ILO in Geneva to further discuss this case and \nprogress towards a final resolution. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \nAsia Pacific \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

Papua New\nGuinea is a complex mosaic, with many of the current socio-economic challenges tied to historical issues\nthat pre-date the onset of the PNG LNG Project by decades. While the PNG LNG Project is not the cause\nof PNG's or Hela’s low socio-economic indicators, when tied to sound national economic policies, it can\nbe part of a solution that helps Papua New Guineans build a more prosperous and sustainable future for\nthemselves.\n\nPNG LNG royalty payments due to the government began, and have continued, since the start of\nproduction operations in 2014. Payment and distribution of royalties and other benefits due to landowners\nin the Project area is the responsibility of the PNG government and is based upon benefits sharing\nagreements previously executed between the government and Project area landowners. Government\ndistribution of royalties and benefits to LNG plant-area landowners began in 2017. Payment of royalties\nand other benefits due to landowners in Hela Province and other upstream areas will commence as\nbenefits claims previously filed by certain landowners in the courts are resolved, and the government\ncompletes the additional landowner identification process that it commenced in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nPNG LNG has contributed some 14 billion PGK (4.3 billion USD*) to local businesses and the\ngovernment through employment taxes, MRDC and Kumul Petroleum disbursements, development\nlevies, royalties, and license maintenance fees. Of this, more than 3.5 billion PGK (1.07 billion USD) has\nbeen spent with landowner companies. Nearly 2600 employees and contractors are engaged in PNG\nLNG production operations.

Labor Rights Forum campaign urges H&M to meet its living wage commitment - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre", "response_text": "Stockholm, Sweden \n2018-5-2 \n\nDear Ms. Zeldenrust, \n\nThank you for reaching out to us. We always appreciate stakeholders clearly communicating their \nconcerns and expectations on us, and we trust below will provide you confidence that we remain \ncommitted to our vision of a fair living wage.  \n\nBack in 2013, when our Fair Living Wage strategy was launched, our vision clearly stated: \n“Even though our strategy initially focuses on the suppliers we work with, we want to see change \nthroughout the industry; all workers at textile factories, regardless of who is the buyer, should earn a \nfair living wage”.  \n\nIn this we share the same ambition. However, as we are sure you are also aware from our previous \nconversations, our understanding of the best approach by which to achieve a fair living wage is \nsomewhat different. We developed our strategy in consultation with key stakeholders such as the \nILO and the global trade union organisation IndustriALL, and in response to your 2nd and 3rd point the \nconclusion of these consultations - that informed our strategy - was that as living wage is an industry-\nwide issue joint solution negotiated by the actors in the industry in a country have the greatest \npotential to stand the test of time and to be enforced in practice than any top down or single brand \nsolution from afar. H&M group has a clear role to play to facilitate the payment of living wages, but \nwe have always been clear that there are many factors beyond our control involved and that we \ndepend on shared responsibility for the vision to be achieved.  \n\nThis said, we have a unique position and a responsibility through our size and scale to influence \nchange on factory, industry and country level. Our fair living wage strategy was developed with this \nin mind and focus on different areas and levels: \n\n1.  We train workers and management about their rights and responsibilities through our workplace \ndialogue programmes and facilitate democratic elections of worker representatives. We promote \nwell-functioning workplace dialogue and industrial relations. These efforts are important for \nworkers themselves to be empowered to take responsibility for improved working conditions, \nincluding wages. \n\n2.  We engage with factory owners directly to help them implement well-functioning wage \n\nmanagement systems at the factories. Simply put, the new wage system differentiates individual \nwages on the basis of skills, responsibility and experience, and provide to the workers a fair, \nprogressive and transparent wage setting mechanism. The wage grid encourages skill \ndevelopment and make the employers aware that wages that are higher and differentiated can \ncontribute to retention, productivity and a better collaborative culture. To avoid any \nmisunderstanding, improved wage management system doesn’t mean that workers get a living \nwage after implementation, but factories that have implemented the new system tend to \nprovide higher wages to those who haven’t as of yet gone through the programme. Most \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fimportantly though - it helps change mindset from seeing wages purely as a cost and it lays the \nfoundation for informed wage negotiations.  \n\n3.  We ensure that we maintain good purchasing practices and aim for direct, long-term and stable \nbusiness relationships with our suppliers. Good purchasing practices facilitate living wages to be \npaid (see also the section on ACT). We have our own sourcing staff in each production country \nsince many years back which helps good communication and continuous improvements on our \npart. \n\n4.  To be able to bring about change across the industry, we collaborate with experts, NGOs, unions \nand other brands, for example through our partnership within the groundbreaking ACT platform, \nour Global Framework Agreement (GFA) with IndustriALL, and various collaboration projects. The \nGFA helps to build trust between the social partners as well as capacity of local unions and \nemployers, and ACT works towards facilitating industry-wide collective bargaining agreements to \nincrease wages and improve working conditions facilitated by purchasing practices. \n\n5.  We engage in dialogue with local governments to further develop the legal framework needed \nfor improved industrial relations, including enabling freedom of association and collective \nbargaining agreements. \n\nEven if we cannot decide directly what workers are paid at our suppliers’ factories, we can support \nthe foundation for a fair living wage to be paid, collaborate with others to drive change on industry \nlevel and advocate for enabling country frameworks. This is important to us and we remain \ncommitted to drive this agenda forward – during 2018 and beyond. \n\nThe first milestone of our Fair Living Wage roadmap is to “establish the foundation and mechanism to \nenable for fair living wages to be paid”. Our goal for 2018 is that a majority of our suppliers’ factories \n(representing 50% of our product volume) should have democratically elected worker \nrepresentatives in place, as well as progressive and transparent wage systems ensuring that the \nwages take the worker’s skills, experience, performance and responsibility into account. The size and \nreach of our ambition is the same as in 2013 when we launched our roadmap. We also had as a goal \nthat 90% of our suppliers should consider H&M group as a fair business partner.  \n\nWhen summarizing 2017, we can conclude that two of these goals are already met and we \nare  progressing according to plan to also secure functional wage management systems covering \n50% of our product volume.  Furthermore, we have made good progress in collaboration with others \non industry and country level. \n\nThe need to secure a fair living wage to the workers in our supply chain, and the global garment \nindustry in general, is without doubt one of the most pressing social issues we are facing today. It is \nan issue shared by the industry, and which requires the contribution of all concerned stakeholders if \nwe are to realize a sustainable solution. Brands like H&M clearly has a crucial role to play, but of \nequal importance are also trade unions, suppliers, and governments in sourcing markets. This is why \nwe have formed partnerships and entered into agreements with others, which will enable us to fulfil \nour commitments.  \n\nKey among these collaborative efforts is the work being undertaken within ACT (Action Collaboration \nTransformation), a partnership where H&M, IndustriALL Global Union, and a number of other leading \nbrands and retailers have come together behind a commitment to achieve living wages in the \ngarment industry through industry-wide collective bargaining facilitated by purchasing practices. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fTo reply to your 4th point, we would like to provide some additional information about ACT. H&M, in \njoining the ACT partnership in 2014, clearly expressed our commitment to enable freedom of \nassociation, collective bargaining and living wages in the global garment supply chains. The \nagreement we signed sets out our commitment not only as to how a living wage should be \nunderstood, but also on how to achieve it. It also reinforces our belief in developing mature \nindustrial relations and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements, negotiated by national trade \nunions and suppliers. \n\nFurthermore, we clearly recognize the importance of a joint approach between global brands, \nsuppliers and global unions and their national affiliates, to create industry-wide agreements that are \nregistered and legally enforceable under law. ACT provides a framework for action that all members \nagree to implement, and we believe that solutions negotiated by the actors in the industry have the \ngreatest potential to reflect the needs and possibilities of the industry. Change on industry level can \nonly be effective if global brands and retailers join together to promote what John Ruggie terms \n“collective action to leverage change.” In a letter to Guy Ryder in 2016 he wrote that “ the \nBangladesh Accord and the ACT initiative are two such instances that illustrate the promise of \ncollective action to leverage change. Importantly, these initiatives are not just about voluntary \nphilanthropic contributions to development, but also a product of a recognized responsibility of \ncompanies to address severe human rights risks in their supply chains. In doing so, these initiatives \nmake a critical contribution to sustainable development.” Since then additional endorsement has \ncome also from the G20 Labour and Employment Ministers Meeting 2017. \n\nAs a member of ACT, H&M has committed to working towards this goal through efforts within \nseveral areas, including: \n\n• \n\n• \n\nIndustry-wide collective bargaining: collective bargaining at an industry level is the missing \nmechanism which will enable significant progress to be made towards achieving a living wage for \ngarment workers. Its absence from the garment industry today is the main obstacle to achieving \nhigher wages. Without industry-wide collective bargaining, the current structural barriers within \nglobal supply chains make a single brand solution to living wages impossible. ACT is currently \noperating in several sourcing markets, and we believe that, if the results will be in line with our \nexpectations, the number of workers that will benefit from it will be substantial, contributing to \nmake a real change. \nImproving purchasing practices: the ACT process creates a framework for brands, together with \nIndustriALL, to identify which purchasing practices have the greatest impact on wages and \nworking conditions. As a member of ACT, we are in the process of adopting common \ncommitments on purchasing practices. We would like also to point out, to reply to your 5th point, \nthat we adopt an open costing system, which allows us to keep the cost of the wages separated \nin the negotiations.  \n\nAs we have previously seen with the Bangladesh Accord, the ACT initiative must grow to include \nmore global brands and retailers. We keep encouraging brands who are not yet members of ACT to \nsimilarly join our efforts in taking collective action to leverage change in the garment industry, and \nwe engage with key stakeholders to support the initiative.  \nAs always, we appreciate you reaching out to us. Clean Clothes Campaign was one of the \nstakeholders we consulted when forming our strategy and we value the dialogue. Despite our \ndifferences in how we view what drives progress towards living wages, we share the same ambition. \n\nWhen we launched our strategy, we didn’t have a clear view on how to exactly reach our vision even \nthough we had identified a few measurable goals and we were aware that we would have successes \nas well as failures along the way, and that we also depend on other actors for systemic change. But \n\n \n \n \n \n\fmost importantly we knew where we want the industry to go. We have made a lot of important \nlearnings, seen great progress and we stay committed. Being bold and outspoken with a vision is \nneeded if one seeks for more than incremental change and for new ways of working and \ncollaborations to form.  \n\nThe steps forward and positive results during 2017, as well as our continued collaborations with \nhighly appreciated partners and peers, combined with exchange of perspectives with various \nstakeholders inspire us to continue our challenging work within our Fair Living Wage strategy - during \n2018 and beyond.  \n\nKind regards, \nAnna Gedda"}

This understanding of how to drive improvements on wages is shared by the global trade unions and the International Labour Organisation, whom we consulted extensively when we set our Fair Living Wage Roadmap.\nAccording to the ILO and the global trade union IndustriALL there is no universal benchmark on how to calculate a living wage. Instead they stress the importance of promoting freedom of association and collective bargaining, as necessary for workers and employers to negotiate wages and working conditions. We share this view and this is why our efforts are focused on supporting the establishment of transparent and fair wage management systems, workplace dialogue and improved industrial relations.”"}

We have a contractor management \nsystem in place to see that contractors comply with our requirements. \n\nIn 2016, as part of our SafeWork programme, Mopani launched a safety campaign, “Doing it \nRight”, aiming to clearly define its expectations and empowering supervisors to put the \nSafeWork principles in place.   \n\nThe primary focus of Mopani’s sustainable development academy is contractor management \nand pre-employment screening. This includes reviewing medical status and fitness for work, \nsafety training, regulatory competencies, induction and training for special risk jobs eg \nworking at heights. Mopani treats its contractor employees in the same manner as its direct \nemployees. \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

Mopani’s new state of the art \nsmelter has increased production, maintained job stability, and now captures in excess of \n95% of all emissions, well within the limits accepted as being world-class for copper \nsmelters.  \n\nMopani has established remote, real-time monitoring stations for SO2 emissions in its \nsurrounding communities; the measured levels of SO2 at the monitoring stations are well \nbelow the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) guideline limit for 24 hour-\naveraging periods in respect of ambient air. Mopani sends monthly reports on the emissions \ndata collected from these monitoring stations to ZEMA, who make these reports publicly \navailable upon request.  \n\nHowever, there have been a few instances where these limits were exceeded for a short \nperiod during the smelter start-up following maintenance closures. Mopani has established \na system to inform the community about possible increases in emissions each time there is a \nrestart.  \n\nSince 2015, as an additional mitigation measure, Mopani agreed with the community to \nstation a medical team in the community for the duration of the start-up to attend to \ncommunity members who may be affected by the slight increase in emissions during the \nrestart process. To date, we have received no complaints from the community. \n\nMopani is committed to a maintaining a safe workplace for all of its employees and \ncontractors, which includes managing and mitigating its environmental impacts. Mopani, \nlooks forward to continuing its constructive and transparent relationship with its local \ncommunities as well as regional and national government representatives.  \n\nKind regards, \n\nAnna Krutikov \nGroup Head of Sustainability"}

We also hope the next lines will  help \nFacing Finance understand how Vale has responded to the emergency and continues to monitor \nand  support  all  human  rights  remedy  processes  and  environmental  recovery  of  the  Samarco \naccident. \n\nVale recognizes there is still room for improvement, and is dedicated to achieving higher levels \nof  performance.  Nevertheless,  much  has  been  already  achieved  and  should  not  be  so  easily \ndisregarded. \n\nVale S.A. – The company \n\nVale  S.A.  is  the  largest  mining  company  in  the  Americas  and  one  of  the  largest  in  the  world, \nleading  the  global  marked  in  iron  ore,  iron  ore  pellets,  and  nickel.  It  is  also  dedicated  to  the \nproduction of manganese, other non-ferrous minerals and fertilizers. With this portfolio, it operates \nin 26 countries on five continents, relying on robust logistics systems. Through its affiliates and \njoint ventures, or directly, it holds relevant investments in the energy and steel industries. In 2016, \nwith a workforce of 139.7 thousand, of which 109.5 thousand are located in Brazil, Vale totaled \nUS$24.3 billion in  distributed  economic value, aligned  with its vocation of transforming natural \nthe  company,  please  check: \nresources \nhttp://www.vale.com/EN/investors/company/fact-sheet/Pages/default.aspx  . \n\ninto  wealth.  For  more \n\ninformation  on \n\nVale recognizes that in its activities, due to the characteristics of the extractive sector, there are \nnumerous challenges regarding environmental and social aspects. That is why the company is \ncommitted  to  maintaining  a  transparent  dialogue  with  its  stakeholders,  invest  in  training, \ntechnology, innovation, risk and impact management focusing on continuous improvement.   \n\nVale  is  a  world  class  mining  company  that  adopts  international  and  national  social  and \nenvironmental  standards  to  conduct  its  businesses  and  is  committed  with  sustainability  of  its \noperations and the sustainable development of the communities and regions where it operates.  \n\nLa Morada, Peru \n\nVale concluded by the end of the second semester the process of devolution of this area to the \nGovernment of Peru. \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n\fMoatize Mine, Mozambique \n\nFirstly, we would like to reiterate that Vale is in compliance with the Resettlement Plan (Plano \nde Reassentamento) agreed with, and approved by the Mozambican Authorities.  \n\nWith regards to the process of guaranteeing the long-term livelihood of the resettled \ncommunities, Vale develops actions that not only guarantee livelihoods, but also actions that \nimprove the quality of life of these populations. For this end, two sets of actions are in progress: \ni) focuses on maintaining the population's livelihoods and ii) promoting self-employment. \n\nActions to maintain livelihoods: \n\n  Annual  support  to  the  agricultural  campaign  providing  improved  seeds  and  technical \n\nsupport for the development of more efficient production practices; \n\n  Encouragement of fruit trees plantation to contribute for a more diversified diet. \n\nActions to promote self-employment (Income Generation) \n\n  Poultry  Project:  Training  poultry  farmers  how  to  improve  their  chicken  production.  The \nbeneficiaries  received  the  initial  inputs  and  support  for  the  construction  of  aviaries. \nCurrently  the  group  has  founded  an  association  and  produces  the  feed  with  its  own \nmeans. \nIncome Culture Project: with emphasis on the production of peanut and sesame, products \nwith a high degree of commercialization in the region; \n\n \n\n  Horticulture Project: production of diversified vegetables that focuses on the local market \nin need of these products (in addition to improving the local community´s nutrition); \n  Production of soap: reusing cooking oil discarded in the preparation of meals for workers \n\nat the mine; \n\n  Production of footwear, carpets, bicycle pedals, among other articles: based on the re-\n\nuse of rubber discarded conveyor belts. \n\nITEM \n\nPROJECT \n\nNº \n\n1 \n\nMaintenance of \nlivelihoods \n\n• Annual support to the agricultural campaign \n\n8.tons in 2017 – 712 \nBeneficiaries \n\n• Technical support for planting \n\n330 Beneficiaries \n\n• Stimulation of fruit trees plantation \n\n15 Beneficiaries \n\nITEM \n\nPROJECT \n\nNº \n\n• Poultry farming \n\n282 Beneficiaries \n\n• Cateme's Feed Mill Project \n\n184 members \n\n• Horticulture \n\n140 Beneficiaries \n\n2 \n\nIncome Generation \nProjects \n\n• Income Cultures \n\n176 Beneficiaries \n\n• Shango Project \n\n01 Beneficiaries \n\n• Cateme Soap Production Project \n\n04 Beneficiaries \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe social programs carried out by Vale are offered to all families resettled and they are released \nwith  the  support  of  community  leaders  and  Cateme  Community  Radio.  We  emphasize  that \nmembership \nin  consideration.  \nFamilies can enter more than one program, just as there are families that do not yet belong to \nincome generation projects, opting to participate only in the maintenance of livelihoods. \n\nthe  vocation  of  candidates \n\nis  voluntary  and \n\ntaken \n\nis \n\nIt´s important to consider that all income generation projects are a challenge for both the company \nand the families. Turning these individuals into entrepreneurs is a medium- and long-term process \nand  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  long-term  perspective  to  achieve  this  transformation.  \nCurrently, about 70% of the resettled families are enrolled in at least one program offered, which \nconstitutes a significant number.  \n\nIn relation to job security and health, Vale has as one of its main values \"life matters most\", \n\ntherefore, prioritizes and implements in a routine and coordinated way, actions that aim to \n\npromote and preserve health and ensure the safety of workers, acting in three main areas: \n\nOccupational hygiene, focusing on: \n\n  Anticipation and identification of existing risk factors in each work area; \n\n  Assessment of risks and level of exposure of employees; \n\n \n\nImplementation and monitoring of disposal and control measures (determining the \n\nspecific type of PPE that must be used for each type of environmental agent); \n\n  Periodic monitoring and evaluation of the program. \n\nOccupational health, focusing on: \n\n  Conduct pre-occupational medical examinations to assess the health profile of the \n\ncandidate and thus determine if the candidate is fit to perform the function for which he \n\nis being hired; \n\n  Conduct periodic medical examinations (semiannual and annual) to assess the health \n\nstatus of the worker and to identify early any health problem; \n\n \n\nImplementation of health promotion activities, carrying out health and safety tool box \n\ntalk in the different work fronts, with the aim of raising awareness among workers in the \n\nadoption of good practices for the preservation of their health. \n\n \n\nImplementation of the quality of life program, which aims to monitor and monitor all \n\nworkers who have a chronic illness; \n\n  Providing a fully equipped clinic, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with professionals \n\nqualified to provide quality health services in a timely manner. \n\n  Provides to all employees with a robust Health Plan that allows him and his \n\ndependents, a differentiated and personalized service in accredited clinics, as well as, \n\nin emergencies, air evacuation in and out of the country for better diagnosis and \n\ntreatment. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fAnd in Occupational Safety, several actions are carried out: \n\n  An Induction program for all new employees including contractor employees’ main focus \n\non matters related to health, safety and environment; \n\n  A safety video for new employees and visitors to our site; \n\n  All activities at Moatize Coal Mine do only initiate after risk assessment is conducted \n\nand/or when all steps of the existing procedure is being followed; \n\n  Vale provides training sessions as well as capacity building to its employees with focus \n\non operational procedures and safety related matters which are provided to all \n\nsupervision areas; Vale possess a training center on site (Educação Valer) with aim to \n\neducate and training its employees and this goes under according to our value “Improve \n\nTogether”; \n\n  All employees are issued with personal protective equipment for their activities, as well \n\nas they are provided with all tools to perform safely their tasks; \n\n  To manage and prevent fatigue, the Operation of Vale Moatize revised and changed the \n\nshift and a new shift was implemented that provides less fatigue and is safer to \n\nemployees; \n\n  There is available on Moatize site an emergency center with a rescue team \n\n(paramedics and fire fighters) always ready for an emergency 24 hours a day and 7 \n\ndays a week; \n\n  A leading indicator for leadership (Vale and Contractors): safety inspections and \n\nbehavioral dialogue for leaders with aim to create more interaction of the leaders with \n\nthe activities in the working fronts and arise more consciousness regarding hazards and \n\nrisks; \n\n  A procedure for identification, communication and investigation of safety related \n\nincidents (accidents and near-miss) and the objective is organizational learning and \n\nimprovement of our processes in terms of safety; \n\n  Celebrated in Moatize Coal Mine a new transport contract that is providing more \n\ncomfort to employees during the travelling from home to work and vice-versa. \n\nIn addition, and to improve the health and safety conditions of workers, direct and indirect, \n\nalso made available: \n\n  Canteen with air-conditioner where breakfasts, lunches and dinners are distributed to \n\nworkers in a regular daily basis. \n\n  Provided drinking water, lighting, ventilation, bathroom in the workplace. \n\nPlease recall that for Vale production never overlap our value \"Life matters most\". \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fRio Colorado Mine, Argentina \n\n As  part  of  the  procedure  for  obtaining  the  environmental  approval  and  due  to  stakeholders \nconcerns on salt (NaCl) contamination risks, the company undertook a series of assessments for \nthe final location of the Salt Storage Facility (SSF). The site for the SSF was selected taking into \naccount  natural  and  social  conditions  of  each  proposed  site.  After  a  careful  consideration  the \nchosen site was located approximately 18 km from the Colorado River (Rio Colorado).  A specific \nSocial and Environmental Report was submitted in 2007 and was approved in August 14 2009 by \na  Resolution  from  the  environmental  and  mining  authorities  after  evaluation  by  the  University \n(Universidad Tecnológica Nacional - Regional San Rafael) and 13 specialized organisms (public \nand  NGOs)  appointed  by  the  Mendoza  Province.      Additionally,  as  part  of  the  environmental \nmanagement program developed, an early alert system was designed for monitoring underground \nwater quality and surface water - including the Colorado River. Vale started the construction in \n2011 but in March 2013, the construction of the Project was suspended. There was no production \nof NaCl. \n\nCarajás Railroad, Brazil \n\nVale  seeks  to  maintain  a  respectful  relationship  and  carry  out  actions  that  avoid,  mitigate  or \ncompensate possible impacts of its operations on these populations. Therefore, it has stablished \nAgreements with the Awá and other indigenous peoples which live  in the influence area of the \nCarajás  Railroad,  either  through  Funai,  third  party  partners  or  directly  with  indigenous \nassociations. \n\nVale  maintains  a  Cooperation  Agreement  to  support  the  Awá,  Guajajara  and  Urubu  Ka'apor \npeoples who inhabit the Caru, Awá and Alto Turiaçu Indigenous Lands and include productive \nactivities focused on the ethno development of these populations.  \n\nVale has agreements with indigenous peoples for more than 30 years. In 1982, Vale signed an \nagreement with Funai to collaborate with the processes of territorial demarcation in the region, \nwhich represented the priority of the indigenous peoples. In relation to the Awá Indigenous Land, \nlocated  35  km  from  the  Carajás  Railroad,  included  in  this  initial  support,  legal  third  parties, \ncontrary to indigenous rights, filed challenges. This generated a long and difficult process until its \nfinal homologation in 2005. During this period, Vale remained with the Awá in their struggle for \nthe territory, including financial support for the demarcation process with Funai, which guaranteed \nthe 116,582 hectares of its Indigenous Land. \n\nAs for the expansion of the Carajás Railroad, we clarified that the duplication works of the railroad \noccurred strictly within the existing domain range. In fact, what is being done is the interconnection \nof existing maneuvering yards. \n\nIt should be noted that the Carajás Railroad does not cut any indigenous lands in Maranhão and \nthat the Awá villages closest to the railroad are Awá and Tiracambú, distant about 1,100m and \n1,700 meters from the railroad, respectively. Additionally, it should be clarified that these people \nare semi-nomadic and, as seen, has been moving beyond the limits of the Awá Indigenous Land, \nfurther away 35 km from the railroad. \n\nRegarding  the  licensing  process  for  the  expansion  of  the  Carajás  Railway,  the  indigenous \ncommunities  are  previously  and  permanently  informed  and  systematically  consulted  about  the \nvarious aspects of the project and consulted on the procedures to be  adopted in the licensing \nprocess  with  the  government  bodies  -  Ibama  and  Funai.  This  dialogue  is  carried  out  by  a \nmultidisciplinary  team  with  experience  in  the  relationship  with  Indigenous  Peoples  that \npermanently make visits, meetings and workshops to these communities, accompanied by the \nFront  of  Ethnographic  Protection  of  Funai.  The  studies  are  conducted  by  experienced  and \nindependent anthropologists and faithfully follow Funai's guidelines. They identified each of the \n\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fimpacts  of  the  expansion  of  the  railroad  on  indigenous  communities,  as  well  as  suggested \nmitigation measures, contributing to the preservation of their physical and cultural integrity. The \nindigenous perspective is prioritized in this process and and their consent is needed. \n\nThe works for the expansion of the railroad were only started after the conclusion and approval \nof the Study of the Indigenous Component -  a study that is carried out with the direct participation \nof the indigenous people –  by Funai.  Also, and necessarily with the participation of the Awá-\nGuajá Indigenous People, the Basic Environmental Plan is being implemented with the relevant \nmitigating measures, all in compliance with Brazilian legislation and considering the perspective \nof ILO Convention 169. \n\nThe  dialogue  is  permanent  and  other  initiatives  have  been  made  possible  in  addition  to  the \nCooperation  Agreement  and  environmental  licensing  process.  For  example,  support  for  the \nconstruction and equipping of 3 Basic Health Units in partnership with the DSEI-MA (Maranhão \nSpecial  Indigenous  Sanitary  District)  and  the  BNDES,  which  were  installed  in  2  Awá  and  1 \nGuajajara villages of Caru Indigenous Land. \n\nVale believes in supporting ethno development of Indigenous Peoples and in long-term, respectful \nand mutually beneficial relationships.  \n\nSamarco Mineração, Fundão Dam, Brazil \n\nThe Samarco accident was a terrible, dramatic and unprecedented event in 73 years of Vale’s \nexistence,  operation  and  the  operation  of  controlled  and  affiliated  companies.  Vale  and  BHP \nBilliton  own  50%  each  of  Samarco  shares.  Vale  has  always  emphasized  to  Samarco  the \nimportance  of  implementing  policies  and  standards  in  line  with  its  own  and  has  supported \nSamarco in its efforts to address the damages caused by the accident. Moreover, from the first \nday of the accident, Vale and its employees have been committed with the emergency response \nand,  right  after,  with  the  human  rights  remediation  and  environmental  recovery,  supporting \nSamarco  and  Renova  Foundation  in  all  areas  needed  and  guaranteeing  the  funding  and \nimplementation of the 41 programs that were established on the agreement with the federal and \nstate governments, together with BHP Billiton. \n\nSamarco’s Accident: \n\nOn the 5th of November 2015, Fundão dam failed and part of the tailings reached Santarém Dam, \nwhich was used to storing water, provoking a partial erosion on the right shoulder of the dam. The \nmaterial reached Gualaxo do Norte river nearby, travelled along its bed, then flowed into the Doce \nriver, reaching the sea in Espírito Santo State on November 22nd, 2015. \n\nThe main impacts were: \n\n  18 fatalities and 1 missed person, presumed dead \n  Around 2,200 hectares impacted along 650 kilometers of the river \n  Temporary suspension of water supply in 16 locations \n \n  Approximately  300  rural  producers  impacted.  Some  of  them  also  had  their  production \n\nImpact on public and private infrastructure, including 3 communities to be relocated \n\ncapacity impacted \n\n  Around 7,500 fishermen impacted due to a ban of fishing activities \n\nThe shareholders of Samarco, BHP Billiton and Vale, provided immediate support to Samarco to \nimplement emergency rescue and relief actions for victims and, subsequently, social remediation \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fand environmental recovery programs. The three companies immediately launched a series of \nsocial, environmental and economic remediation and mitigation actions.  \n\nAn agreement with federal and state authorities was established facilitating the coordination and \nbetter efficiency of the remediation measures. \n\nThe main aspects it encompasses: \n\n  Reparation of the environment and of the communities impacted \n  Environmental compensation where reparation is not possible, such as:  \n\no  Project for basic sanitation for the regions impacted  \no  Reconstruction of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo \n\n  Creation  of  the  Renova  Foundation  to  manage  the  socioenvironmental  and  socio \n\n \n\n \n\neconomic programs \nImplementation  deadline  of  15  years,  renewable  until  all  the  programs  have  been \nimplemented \n Establishment  of  advisory  committees  with  the  participation  of  technical  specialists, \nregulators and representatives of the communities \n\n  R$ 4.4 bi in the first three years (2016-2018) to guarantee the progress of the reparation \n\nand compensation actions, while the projects are being detailed \n\n  R$ 0.8-1.6 bi per year from 2019 to 2021, the value will be defined based on approved \n\nprojects \n\n  R$  240  million  per  year  over  15  years  (since  the  signature  of  the  agreement)  for  the \n\nexecution of the compensation projects \n\n  Additional payment of 500 million to fund sanitation initiatives from 2016 to 2018 \nIn case that Samarco has no resources, Vale and BHP will fund the amounts due \n \n\nPlease, access the attached documents for detailed information: \n\n  Samarco’s Report - 1 Year since the Accident – with the emergency actions and start \nthe  agreement.  http://samarco.com/wp-\n\nthe  41  programs  defined \n\nof \ncontent/uploads/2017/01/Book-Samarco_Ingles_v1.pdf  \n\nin \n\n  Renova  Foundation  Report  -  for  the  better  understanding  of  the  governance  of  the \nremediation and recovery process and a thorough account on all that has been done so \nfar and all that it will still to be completed in the mid-term and the next 10 to 20 years. \nhttp://www.fundacaorenova.org/en/activity-report/about-the-report/ \n\n After the accident, a Dam Department was created to assess and improve the dam management \nprocesses at Vale, generating action plans and targets. All Vale dams received both internal and \nexternal  auditing  and  some  action  plans  have  been  implemented  to  increase  our  level  of \noperational  efficiency and  security.  All  Vale dams surpass the security  level of any national or \ninternational legislation. The company also reviewed its emergency plans, including community \nengagement and community mobilization in case of an accident.  In the 2016 strategic planning \ncycle,  Vale  proposed  a  new  guideline  to  maximize  iron  ore  production  with  natural  moisture, \nreducing tailings generation, optimizing material disposal, separating the slurry from thick tailings \nand using pits to dispose of the slurry. This new plan estimates a 600 million metric-ton reduction \nof  generated  iron  ore  tailings  by  2030,  which  means  a  32%  reduction  compared  to  previous \nproduction  plans.  In  2016,  the  iron  ore  production  was  60%  moist  beneficiation  and  40%  with \nnatural moisture. The beneficiation process is expected to be reversed in the coming years, and \nmay reach 70% beneficiation with natural moisture. \n\nMeanwhile  Vale  has  boosted  its  Risk  Management.  Nowadays  Vale  has  an  integrated  Risk \napproach for all types of risk, encompassing business and processes risk.  \n\n7 \n\n \n \n \n\fThe Samarco accident was a terrible event, nevertheless, it has increased our understanding of \nrisks and impacts. New technology is being developed and implemented in various areas. As an \nexample, Vale is implementing a pilot project on an industrial scale with the objective of studying \nand developing new tailings disposal technologies, aimed at seeking disposal alternatives beyond \ndams or drainage piles.   \n\nVale reiterates that it will continue to support Samarco in all that is necessary to minimize victims' \npain and environmental damage, and that we will do all we can to establish the highest safety \nstandards in the mining industry. \n\nAll  remediation  and  recovery  actions  adopted  by  Samarco  and  now,  Renova  Foundation,  are \naligned  with  national  and  international  standards  and  best  practices  and  the  companies’ \ncommitment with Global Compact 10 Principles.  \n\nMina do Pico, Brazil \n\nIn February of 2015, the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MTE) supervised the Pico Mine \n(MG), specifically the Ouro Verde company, that provides to Vale transportation services for \nfinished products.  \n\nBecause of alleged irregular outsourcing, as well as the submission of workers to the condition \nanalogous to slavery, the ministry filed infringement proceedings against Vale.  These tax \nassessments were all challenged by Vale. The classification of these irregularities as “labour \nanalogous to slavery” is not appropriate, since all of Ouro Verde’s employees were properly \nregistered, with working papers signed and wages paid, operating air-conditioned trucks to \nprotect them from the dust and heat, and transporting them to their homes every day in safe \nand adequate transportation.  \n\nVale repudiates any and all forms of disrespect for human rights and did everything in its power \nto remedy the situation and ensure that it does not recur in its projects and operations.  \n\nAt the time of the inspection, the contractor was formally and immediately notified by Vale to \nprovide improvements at the construction site and to remedy the irregularities. The work activity \nwas paralyzed and resumed three days later. In July, Vale entered into an agreement with the \nFederal Labour Prosecutor’s Office, reinforcing its commitment to the compliance with \nstandards applicable to the working environment of its employees and collaborators. Ouro \nVerde entered into the same agreement.  \n\nIn 2016 Vale contracted an external company to provide a detailed diagnosis in all of Vale’s \nunits in Minas Gerais, verifying the physical conditions of installations and issues related to the \navailability of basic hygiene and drinking water, as well as the legal aspects of Sanitary \nConditions and Comfort in the Workplace, regulated by the Labour Ministry. The result of this \ndiagnosis was registered in the Federal Labour Prosecutor’s Office, and can be broadly and \nfreely consulted by stakeholders.  \n\nThe actions established in the agreement with the Labour Ministry have been fulfilled, both by \nVale and Ouro Verde. Internal groups were later structured to identify and carry out continuous \nimprovements in facilities and workplaces. The results and improvements have been monitored \nin the meetings of area leaders. The contract between Vale and Ouro Verde was cancelled and, \nuntil the end, inspections conducted by Vale were intensified.  \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOnça Puma Nickel mine, Brazil \n\nVale clarifies that the Onça Puma Mine in Ourilândia do Norte (PA) is regularly licensed by the \nEnvironment and Sustainability Secretary of the State of Pará (Semas), in compliance with all the \nconditions  established  by  the  environmental  agency  and  the  National  Foundation  of  the \nIndigenous Peoples (Funai). \n\n For years, Vale has been attempting to carry out the actions of the Basic Environmental Plan \n(PBA)  focused  on  socioeconomic  mitigation  programs  within  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté  Indigenous \nLand, but faces an unjustified resistance by the indigenous people, who maintain the company's \ndenial of access. \n\nThe  company  informs  that  it  has  proposed  to  the  MPF  to  pay  for  the  hiring  of  a  technician  to \naccompany, with the Xikrin, the execution of the PBA, but Vale has not yet been informed of the \nindication of the technician by the federal prosecutors. The company clarifies that it has already \npresented  technical  studies,  demonstrating  that  the  activities  in  Onça  Puma  do  not  generate \npollution of the  Cateté river, and  the  City  of Redenção judge denied the Xikrin request for the \nrelease  of  the  resources  due  to  the  lack  of  evidence  of  their  argument  and  has  determined  a \njudicial inspection to verify the condition of the Xikrin’s tribes and the Cateté river. This inspection \nhas not started yet. \n\nVale reiterates that it will continue to await the authorization of the Xikrin to access the Indigenous \nland  in  order  to  implement  the  actions  defined  in  the  PBA,  already  approved  by  Funai.  Vale \nremains open to dialogue with the Xikrin people, respecting their culture and rights. \n\nVale  will  continue  to  work  seeking  to  overcome  the  challenges  concerning  sustainable \ndevelopment that are shared across various regions and countries where we are present.   We \nare committed to maintaining the energy and hard work to guarantee continuously improvement, \naligned with relevant guiding principles and standards.

Regardless, we are concerned by the allegations and continue to follow \ndevelopments.  \n\nNestlé takes the issue of human and labour rights violations very seriously. Such activities have \nno place in our supply chain and we are committed to engaging with our suppliers to drive \npositive change. If such change is not forthcoming, we reserve the right to review commercial \nrelationships. We welcome this opportunity to provide the following information on our \nresponsible sourcing activities for sugar products and to reaffirm our commitment to the respect \nand promotion of fundamental rights.  \n\nThe respect and promotion of human and labour rights is an important part of our sugar \npurchasing activities. In 2011, Nestlé contracted Proforest, a UK based global not-for-profit \norganisation, to support the development of our Responsible Sourcing Guideline (RSG) \nrequirements for sugar products (sugarcane and sugar beet). The RSG complements our Nestlé \nSupplier Code and defines the social and environmental sustainability requirements that we aim \nto see implemented in our upstream value chain, back to the primary production level. It \nincludes elements related to human and labour rights. We continue to implement the RSG with \nthe expert support of Proforest and other local expert organisations and NGOs.  \n\nWe have engaged in intensive supply chain mapping and traceability efforts in the sugar sector \nover the past six years. This has allowed us to investigate practices at farm and plantation level \nwith our implementation partners. Mitr Phol Thailand was one of the first suppliers to engage in \nthis process. After building a supply chain map linking Mitr Phols’ Thai operations to Nestlé \nfactories in 2013, Proforest carried out a first visit in Danchang in March 2014 followed by a \nsurveillance visit in March 2015. Proforest also visited Mitr Phols’ operations in Chiayphoo in \nMarch 2015.  \n\nDuring these assessments, we cover questions related to human rights issues including child \nlabour and working conditions, land ownership and environmental questions like water \nmanagement and the use of agrochemicals. In February 2017, our Responsible Sourcing team \ntogether with our implementing partner organisations visited Mitr Phol to hear more on the \ncompany’s progress and commitment to our RSG requirements. \n\nMore information on our Responsible Sourcing and Human Rights Due Diligence Programmes is \navailable on nestle.com/csv. \n\n1"}

To achieve this, we are committed to applying international human rights \nstandards across our operations as well as our value chain.  \n\nAs such, we have integrated the UN Framework and Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \ninto the policies that guide the behaviour of our 323,000 employees worldwide and of our business \npartners. We have in place a group-wide Human Rights Due Diligence Programme we implement in \nclose collaboration with selected expert partners.  \n\nAs part of this Programme, since 2011 we have trained more than 96,000 Nestlé employees around \nthe world, carried out 13 Human Rights Impact Assessment in high-risk countries, as well as revised \nour audit and monitoring systems to integrate strengthened human rights requirements. We report \nannually  on  our  performance  in  our  Nestlé  in  Society  report,  using  the  GRI  Standards  and  the  UN \nGuiding Principles Reporting Framework in addition to our own commitments.  \n\nWe  also  work  alongside  others  to  address  specific  human  rights  issues  with  direct  and  upstream \nsuppliers. The challenges involved in addressing human rights in agricultural supply chains are often \nsystemic and complex. We cannot tackle these alone, and so work in collaboration with key partners \nto identify challenges and solutions aligned with supporting the Sustainable Development Goals.  \n\nWe  address  the  issues  flagged  in  the  report  below.  Our  Nestlé  in  Society  report  provides  a \ncomprehensive overview of our actions on the ground in this area. \n\nChild labour in our cocoa supply chain \nWe are opposed to all forms of child exploitation and we have publically committed to preventing and \naddressing child labour wherever it occurs in our supply chain.  \n\nWe  are  tackling  this  complex  and  challenging  issue  in  the  cocoa  sector  through  our  Child  Labour \nMonitoring and Remediation System (CLMRS) in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, in collaboration with the \nInternational Cocoa Initiative. Between 2013 and 2015, we have seen a reduction in child labour of \n51% in farmers’ cooperatives where the system was set up. In 2017, more than 280 000 farmers and \ncommunity  members  attended  awareness  training  on  child  labour  and  more  than  11 000  children \nbenefitted from remediation activities.  \n\nThe Fair Labour Association (FLA) audits our cocoa supply chain annually and reports are published on \nits website, together with our corrective action plans.  \n\nWhile we continue to take action in our own supply chains, we recognise that the scale of the challenge \nrequires collective action. Within the framework of the initiative CocoaAction, we are working with the \nbroader cocoa and chocolate industry to address it. We are pleased to see that more companies have \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fnow  set  up  a  dedicated  CLMRS  in  their  own  supply  chain  and  that  the  certification  body  UTZ  has \nintegrated  specific  requirement  on  child  labour  monitoring  in  their  cocoa  protocol,  contributing  to \nimproving the situation across the entire sector.   \n\nForced labor in fish & seafood in Thailand \nUnfair recruitment practices leading to poor labor conditions have been identified as one of the most \nsignificant challenges within the fish and seafood supply chain, particular in Thailand’s fishing industry.  \n\nFor that reason, we collaborated with Verité to conduct an assessment of these practices and labor \nconditions more broadly in our Thai seafood supply chain in 2015. Out of that study, we developed our \nThailand Action Plan for the Responsible Sourcing of Seafood.  \n\nAs part of this action plan, we are working with our Thai seafood suppliers on responsible recruitment. \nThese suppliers have mapped the recruitment fees that their workers pay and they are now covering \nthese costs as they are discovered. Considering the complexity of the recruitment networks, it takes \ntime to discover the full extent of fees that workers have paid. Tackling this issue in an ongoing effort \nand we fully support our suppliers in leading the way to transform practices in the industry.  \n\nIn parallel, we are partnering with third parties that conduct research in sourcing countries and deploy \nworker voice tools and trainings to get a complete picture of recruitment conditions while also raising \nawareness among workers of their rights:  \n\n  We  partner  with  Issara  to  build  access  to  grievance  mechanisms  and  worker  voice  systems \nthroughout the entirety of our Thai seafood supply chains. By the end of 2017, over 35,000 workers \nin Nestlé’s supply chain (including at  processing sites, feed mills, fishmeal plants,  and on fishing \nvessels) had access to Issara’s independent helpline and can seek assistance and support. Since our \npartnership with Issara began in March 2016, Issara’s Inclusive Labour Monitoring system has been \nimplemented  in  60%  of  Nestlé  petcare’s  Tier  1  supplier  sites,  50%  of  feed  mills,  and  100%  of \nfishmeal plants  in Thailand. Issara is now engaging with vessel owners and boat  captains in our \nsupply chains. \n\n  We  also  partner  with  Verité  to  develop  and  roll  out  responsible  recruitment  trainings  to  vessel \n\nowners, captains, and workers. \n\nHowever, transformative change within the supply chain requires an industry effort, therefore:  \n\n  Through  the  Thai  Seafood  Taskforce,  we  became  a  member  of  the  Responsible  Recruitment \nsubgroup, working to build demand for ethical recruitment practices throughout Taskforce member \nsupply chains.   \n\n  In 2017 we joined the Responsible Labor Initiative, part of the Responsible Business Alliance, with \nthe ambition of working to apply their responsible recruitment tools in our food supply chains. \n  This year, we became a member of the Institute for Human Rights and Business’s Leadership Group \nfor Responsible Recruitment to advocate for and collaborate with industry around the Employer \nPays Principle.  \n\nWe have made significant progress in implementing our action plan and we will continue to provide \npublic updates on our progress on our dedicated webpage. \n\nLand acquisition in our palm oil supply chain in Indonesia \nWe are against all forms of land acquisitions that are illegal or that have an adverse impact on local \ncommunities’ livelihoods. We have committed to develop our business in a way that complies with the \ncustomary  rights  to  land  and  natural  resources  of  indigenous  peoples  and  communities  that  are \nimpacted  or  potentially  impacted  by  our  business  activities.  In  addition,  the  Nestlé  Responsible \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSourcing Standard makes  explicit  provisions  for  preventing  social  conflict  arising  from  potential \ndisputes over land rights and land acquisition. \n\nIn order to address potential challenges linked to this issue, we are working with the NGO The Forest \nTrust (TFT) and multiple suppliers sourcing in Aceh Tamiang, Indonesia, to address deforestation at a \nlandscape level. The programme aims to support and contribute to the government’s land use planning \nprocess, with the intention of creating resilient and thriving ecosystems and communities through a \nunified push towards transformation.  \n\nWe recently announced our accelerated plan towards reaching the company’s 2020 No Deforestation \ncommitment  by  becoming  the  first  global  food  company  to  implement  Starling,  a  satellite-based \nservice, to monitor 100% of its global palm oil supply chains. Starling was developed by Airbus and The \nForest  Trust  (TFT)  as  a  global  verification  system  evidencing  that  no  deforestation  is  taking  place \nthroughout the supply chain. \n\nWe are also working with TFT on a smallholder initiative under their Rurality programme in Indonesia \nto build smallholder inclusion in our palm oil supply chain, while developing smallholders’ resilience \nand their capability to produce responsibly. \n\nIn 2017, TFT and the Danish Institute for Human Rights released the outcomes and action plans of the \nlabour right assessment that we conducted together with one of our main suppliers in the palm oil \nsector.   \n\nSecurity of trade union members in Colombia \nUnfortunately, violence has been widespread in Colombia for many years. The region where Nestlé’s \nBugalagrande factory is located has levels of criminality and violence that are significantly higher than \nthe  national  average.  This  situation  has  affected  trade  union  leaders,  members  of  our  local \nmanagement team, all employees, their relatives, and the Bugalagrande community at large.  \n\nWe have consistently strongly denounced all acts of violence and intimidation against our employees \nin Colombia and their community. We have expressed this, both publicly to the authorities and in direct \nmeetings with the local trade union Sinaltrainal.  \n\nFor several years, we have had a standard protocol agreed with Sinaltrainal for threats and security \nconcerns in general. Any measures, including delivering security support (financial assistance, police \nprotection, relocation, etc.) are taken in accordance with the agreed protocol and closely followed up \non by Nestlé Colombia and Sinaltrainal during their regular meetings. \n\n3"}

H&M sent us the following statement.\nWe are working towards the same vision as the one expressed in the [CCC] report: that textile workers should earn a living wage. We agree that wages are too low in garment producing countries. This is one of the most important questions for our industry, but also one of the most complex issue as it requires an industry solution where brands like ourselves, worker representatives and unions, government and other actors need work together towards transformative change on industry level. We share [CCC]’s concerns – which is the very reason why we are so committed to our work within this area. We have a responsibility and as a big company we can also work with others to influence change.\nTo ensure long term solutions, this work needs to involve all actors. Change will not happen overnight, but gradually we do see positive change. It is essential to stick to such solutions that will bring about change for all garment workers and that stands the test of time– no matter at which factory they work or for which brands they produce. For this to happen we need to drive change for workers on factory level, establish social dialogue on industry level and towards governments to establish an enabling legal framework that supports regular wage revisions, freedom of association and collective bargaining. On factory and industry level it is also important to do so by empowering the workers’ voices and strengthening their skills to be able to negotiate their own wage, just the way we do it in Sweden. Our view is that wages shall be sat through fair negotiations between workers and employers, and this is a view that we share with the ILO, the global trade union federation IndustriALL and Swedish IF Metall.\nThis is how we view our role in bringing about a higher wage level - to ensure the tools are there but not disempower the workers and cheat them of their own negotiation skills and empowerment by dictating a wage level only for thus producing in factories with H&M products. Both ILO and UN stress the importance of strengthening workers’ voices.\nBy working for freedom of association and collective bargaining in countries where our goods are produced, making sure purchasing practices are enabling fair and good wage processes and supporting our supplier factories to implement good workplace dialogue and wage management systems that supports transparent, fair and progressive wage setting principles we are working towards our vision of fair living wages for textile workers. Considering this, we launched our fair living wage strategy 5 years ago, which is currently being evaluated by the aid of a third party to inform the way forward and integrate lessons learnt over the past five years. So far, we have reached 930.000 factory workers in 655 factories covering 10 countries with our fair living wage strategy.

Nous \nvoudrions profiter de cette occasion pour exprimer nos préoccupations quant à la qualité de \nce Dossier en raison de ses inexactitudes factuelles au sujet de Glencore et de notre filiale \nKamoto Copper Company (KCC) en République démocratique du Congo (RDC).  \n\nNous regrettons que Pain pour le prochain (PPP) n’ait pas communiqué avec Glencore ou \nKCC sur ce Dossier avant sa publication. Nous notons néanmoins positivement que PPP \nreconnaît les progrès accomplis par Glencore et KCC en mettant en œuvre des actions \néducatives, en soutenant des coopératives agricoles et en apportant des améliorations dans \nle domaine des soins de santé. \n\nGestion de l’eau \nPPP soutient dans ce Dossier que Glencore a « promis de fournir aux habitants de Musonoi \nune meilleure infrastructure d’approvisionnement en eau d’ici à fin 2017, mais qu’en dehors \nde la construction par KCC de trois stations hydrauliques de l’autre côté de sa concession \nrien n’a été fait ». C’est matériellement inexact : KCC ne s’est jamais engagé à fournir de \nl’eau à la localité de Musonoi dans ces délais.  \n\nAu début de cette année, nous avons expliqué à PPP que la localité de Musonoi avait \ndemandé à KCC de réhabiliter deux puits construits à l’origine par Gécamines. La localité de \nMusonoi reconnaît que ces deux puits constituent les seules solutions viables permettant \nd’assurer l’accès à l’eau dans le court à moyen terme. À ce jour, plusieurs réunions ont eu \nlieu entre KCC et Gécamines afin d’évaluer la situation et élaborer une solution possible. \n\nNous avons communiqué à de nombreuses reprises avec PPP pour répondre à son allégation \nselon laquelle, entre 2012 et 2014, des métaux lourds auraient été rejetés dans la rivière \nLuilu suite aux activités de KCC. À ce jour, on ne sait toujours pas sur quelles preuves repose \ncette allégation. En effet, KCC n’est pas la seule entreprise rejetant de l’eau dans la rivière \nLuilu. Qui plus est, PPP a refusé de présenter les résultats de son analyse d’eau.  \n\nKCC a réalisé des investissements substantiels pour résoudre les problèmes d’eau hérités du \nlong passé de son complexe minier. Datant de plus de 50 ans, celui-ci a été mal entretenu \npar les opérateurs précédents. Pendant de nombreuses années, avant l’investissement de \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O. Box, CH-6341 Baar, Switzerland \nT +41 41 709 20 00  F +41 41 709 30 00 www.glencore.com \nRegistered in Jersey with number 107710 \nRegistered address: Queensway House, Hilgrove Street, St Helier, Jersey JE1 1ES \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fGlencore dans KCC, les opérateurs précédents de KCC ont rejeté des eaux résiduelles sans \ntraitement. Les effluents ont été déversés sans restriction dans l’eau de surface locale. \nDepuis 2009, KCC a investi plus de 40 millions de dollars dans la pose de plus de 20 km \nd’infrastructures de canalisation, une usine de neutralisation par la chaux naturelle, un \nsystème d’élimination des résidus, des pompes spécialisées et des usines de traitement \nd’eau. Le complexe traite désormais l’intégralité de ses effluents avant de les rejeter.  \n\nEn RDC, la législation sur l’eau réglemente le contrôle de celle-ci. KCC contrôle l’eau \nquotidiennement, mensuellement et trimestriellement par le biais de points de prélèvement \nà l’intérieur et à l’extérieur de sa concession ainsi que sur plusieurs sites de surveillance de la \nrivière Luilu. Conformément aux bonnes pratiques internationales en matière d’exploitation \nminière, la totalité des eaux résiduelles de KCC est décantée avant rejet. \n\nKCC soumet au Ministère des mines un rapport annuel sur sa gestion de l’eau et accueille \ndes inspecteurs du gouvernement pour qu’ils procèdent régulièrement à des prélèvements.  \n\nDossier évoque un incident lors duquel Musonoi a été « envahi par la boue » fin 2017. Il \ns’agissait d’une conséquence directe de fortes pluies, sans lien avec les activités de KCC. \nNéanmoins, KCC a ensuite nettoyé les trois principaux égouts aux abords de la route de \nMusonoi afin de réduire les risques avant la prochaine saison des pluies. À la connaissance \nde KCC, la localité n’a pas subi de dommages durables. \n\nDossier évoque par ailleurs une prétendue fuite de la mine ayant pollué le sol et les jardins \nde plus de 400 foyers de Luilu au début de cette année. Au moment de l’incident, KCC a \nexpliqué à la localité affectée que la fuite ne provenait pas de la mine et qu’en raison des \nfortes pluies l’entreprise n’était pas en mesure d’évaluer totalement l’impact sur les \nrécoltes. KCC a choisi d’adopter une approche préventive positive en apportant aux \npersonnes affectées une assistance financière et en les incitant à participer au programme \nde développement communautaire de KCC. Les autorités de la RDC ont finalement identifié \ndix familles touchées par cette fuite. Plus de 460 agriculteurs ont néanmoins reçu une \nassistance financière accordée bénévolement par KCC. Par ailleurs, les agriculteurs ont \nconstitué cinq coopératives agricoles soutenues par le programme de développement \ncommunautaire de KCC.  \n\nLutte contre la poussière \nDossier donne à penser que Glencore « refuse » d’asphalter les rues. C’est une présentation \ntrompeuse. KCC s’acquitte d’une taxe routière auprès du gouvernement de la RDC \nspécifiquement destinée à cet effet. En outre, KCC soutient le gouvernement provincial dans \nune initiative d’infrastructure plus vaste visant à mettre en place une route de \ncontournement destinée à réduire le fort trafic routier à travers la ville de Kolwezi et les \nlocalités avoisinantes.  \n\nOn ne comprend pas bien sur quelle base factuelle PPP affirme que les activités de KCC sont \nmassivement responsables de l’exposition à la poussière de Musonoi. Outre KCC, Sicomines \net Commus exploitent des mines dans la zone située autour de cette localité. Par ailleurs, la \nroute de Musonoi est publique et très utilisée par des usagers non liés aux mines. \n\nEn fait, KCC est la principale entreprise prenant effectivement des mesures qui visent à \natténuer la pollution par la poussière en entretenant la route et en luttant contre la \npoussière par arrosage et utilisation de produits spécifiques. KCC a également planté une \nrangée d’arbres devant la localité de Musonoi afin de la protéger de la poussière. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fÉlaborer et mettre en œuvre des solutions pérennes afin d’améliorer les infrastructures liées \nà l’eau et de rénover les routes exige une approche multipartite impliquant le gouvernement \nrégional, les entreprises du voisinage et les agences nationales. PPP semble attribuer cette \nresponsabilité uniquement à Glencore, ce qui est déraisonnable et irréaliste. Nous \nregrettons également le commentaire de PPP qui, tout en reconnaissant que Glencore \nconstruit bel et bien des écoles, soutient des coopératives et améliore les soins de santé, \naffirme que nous ne nous attaquons pas aux préoccupations réelles de la population. Ce \ncommentaire est inexact et n’est pas corroboré par nos relations avec les collectivités. \n\nCréation d’avantages socio-économiques \nNous en profitons pour souligner les avantages socio-économiques que nos entreprises \ncréent au sein de la RDC. Nous apportons des contributions significatives à l’économie de la \nRDC tant au plan national que local. Nous sommes résolus à appliquer des normes élevées \nen matière de gouvernance d’entreprise et de transparence ainsi que favorables à une \ntransparence accrue en ce qui concerne la redistribution et le réinvestissement des \npaiements effectués au gouvernement.  \n\nNous avons participé activement à l’Initiative pour la transparence dans les industries \nextractives (ITIE) depuis 2011. Chaque année, nous publions un « Rapport des paiements aux \ngouvernements » qui précise notre approche en matière d’impôts et de transparence et \nrecense, pays par pays et projet par projet, les paiements effectués pendant l’année. À \ntravers cette approche transparente, nous soutenons une plus forte responsabilité au sein \ndes pays où nous opérons. \n\nNos entreprises en RDC versent chaque année des impôts et des redevances directement \naux autorités du pays. Depuis 2015, le gouvernement de la RDC a perçu plus de 1,1 milliard \nde dollars d’impôts et de redevances. Par ailleurs, nous avons consacré plus de 1,5 milliard \nde dollars à des dépenses d’investissement en RDC. À l’avenir, nous prévoyons que notre \ncontribution économique et les paiements au gouvernement de la RDC seront sensiblement \nplus élevés en raison de la reprise de la production de cuivre chez KCC en décembre 2017, \nsuite à un investissement majeur opéré sur 18 mois en vue de transformer ses installations \nde traitement. \n\nEn 2017, nos entreprises ont employé plus de 22 000 personnes en RDC et versé 67 millions \nde dollars de salaires. Par ailleurs, elles mettent des structures sanitaires de haut niveau à la \ndisposition de leurs employés et des personnes à leur charge. Certaines accueillent \négalement d’autres habitants de la région. Nous soutenons les campagnes de vaccination \ncontre la poliomyélite et la rougeole pour plus de 30 000 enfants dans les collectivités \nlocales.  \n\nNous proposons des tests VIH/sida à nos employés et à leurs familles. Nous soutenons \négalement le programme national de lutte contre le VIH/sida de la RDC à travers un \nprogramme de formation de pairs éducateurs au sein des collectivités locales, ainsi qu’à \ntravers des campagnes de sensibilisation auprès de ces dernières et de groupes à haut \nrisque, tels que les conducteurs de camions. \n\nNous avons mis en œuvre un vaste programme de contrôle afin de réduire l’impact du \npaludisme sur nos employés ainsi qu’au sein des collectivités locales. En 2017, quelque \n20 000 foyers ont bénéficié d’une pulvérisation, ce qui a protégé plus de 115 000 personnes. \nPar ailleurs, des moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide ont été proposées aux groupes à \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fhaut risque – femmes enceintes et enfants de moins de cinq ans – et des sessions de \nsensibilisation au paludisme ont été organisées au sein des collectivités. \n\nOutre notre participation à la construction, la remise en état et l’équipement d’écoles \nlocales, nous travaillons avec les ONG et les églises locales à la tenue de camps de vacances \nd’été pour les enfants afin d’éviter qu'ils ne participent à des activités minières artisanales \n(ASM). En 2017, plus de 7200 enfants ont participé à ces camps et une réduction notable du \nnombre d’enfants employés à des activités ASM a pu être constatée.  \n\nNous soutenons les projets de diversification économique gérés par des coopératives locales \nvisant à établir des programmes axés sur des modes de subsistance différents afin de réduire \nla participation à des activités ASM. Ces projets sont centrés sur le développement de \ncompétences dans les domaines de l’agriculture, de la soudure, de la menuiserie et de la \nrestauration. En 2017, ils ont permis de former plus de 4000 personnes en vue de \ndévelopper des activités.  \n\nEn coopération avec le gouvernement, nous nous sommes engagés, à hauteur de \n400 millions de dollars, à contribuer à la modernisation des infrastructures électriques de la \nRDC. Ce projet s’inscrit dans un programme de la Banque mondiale consistant à améliorer le \nréseau à haute tension afin de permettre à la compagnie d’électricité nationale SNEL \nd’élargir l’accès à l’électricité dans des zones non ou mal desservies. Il contribuera à générer \nde la croissance économique et des emplois.  \n\nGlencore favorise le dialogue avec ses parties prenantes et encourage des relations \ntransparentes.  Nous espérons que PPP en tiendra compte à l’avenir. \n\nCordialement, \n\nAnna Krutikov \nResponsable Groupe du Développement durable \n\nCopie à : Chantal Peyer"}

As you can see from Antamina´s response (attached), in both instances the company responded \nquickly to contain the spill, notify the community and ensure the appropriate cleanup and remediation \nactions were put in place. These actions ensured no water bodies were contaminated as a result of the \nspill and the appropriate health and environmental monitoring were conducted afterwards to fully mitigate \ndamage or impacts.   \n\nGiven Antamina is an independent operator, should you require further detail on specific efforts associated \nwith the spills, we request you direct these enquires to Antamina. \n\nKind regards, \n\nSantiago Montt \n\nVice President Corporate Affairs Minerals Americas \n\nAttachment: Detailed response by Antamina  \n\nBHP Group Limited ABN 49 004 028 077, BHP Group Plc. registration number 3196209 and their respective subsidiaries are members of the BHP Group.          \nThe BHP Group is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia."}

Antamina mine is jointly owned by Glencore (33.75% interest), \nBHP (33.75%), Teck (22.5%) and Mitsubishi Corporation (10%). \n\nThe media article referenced by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), \nrefers to a request made by the Congresswoman, Maria Elena Foronda, to the Ministry of \nEnergy and Mines to protect the watersheds of the Nepeña,  Casma and Santa rivers, due \nallegations of negative environmental impacts from small and medium-sized mining \nactivities in the Ancash region. \n\nThe Antamina mine is not located in the Nepeña, Casma and Santa water basins. Its \noperations are in the province of Huari, San Marcos District in the Ancash region, a \nconsiderable distance from these basins. \n\nIn addition, Antamina is not considered a small or medium-sized mining operation. It has \nhigh technical, safety, environmental and social standards, which it is currently mapping \nagainst the principles of the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM). \n\nThe article was not specific about the “mining spillages” it referenced; as such, it is difficult \nfor us to provide a detailed response. However, we are aware of two such spillages by \nAntamina, on which we can provide information.  \n\nIn July 2012, a copper concentrate leakage affected the community of community of the \nSanta Rosa (Cajacay) Province of the Bolognesi-Ancash. The leakage occurred due to a \npipeline elbow failure inside a valve station. This spillage took place within a containment \npond and only 7% of the concentrate – around 3m3, or the equivalent of the carrying \ncapacity of a small pick-up truck – leaked beyond the valve station. Antamina immediately \nresponded to the incident and worked with the affected community, Santa Rosa, and local \nauthorities to remedy the impacts. \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

Antamina established and \nfinanced a local health commission with participants from the local authorities, Santa Rosa \ncommunity, the church, and the Ministry of Health. The health commission held meetings \nwith the community, CENSOPAS, Ministry of Health, Medical College of Peru, OEFA, \nOSINERGMIN, PCM, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Energy and Mines and various \ncongressmen. Antamina established medical teams to address any further health concerns. \n\nFollowing the incident, the regional authorities undertook a number of environmental and \nhealth assessments and confirmed that Antamina had responded appropriately and that \nthere were no remaining impacts. The leak did not affect any water body. \n\nAt the time, the incident was widely reported and Antamina provided a full response (in \nSpanish) on its website: https://www.antamina.com/noticias/santa-rosa-de-cajacay. \n\nIn April 2017, the region experienced heavy rains due to Fenomeno del Niño Costero and a \nresulting mudslide caused a workman, who was undertaking road maintenance works, to \ndamage Antamina’s pipeline (at Km44 of the Pativilca-Huaraz access road). Provías, an \nagency that is part of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, employed the \nworker. The worker was using explosives to remove rock. \n\nThe accident caused a leakage of copper concentrate. Antamina’s automated, real-time \nmonitoring system detected the leak and activated the operation’s emergency response \nprocedures. This response led to stoppage of the pumping of copper concentrate and the \nautomatic closure of the appropriate values. \n\nAntamina coordinated its response with the regional authorities and initiated a \ncommunication process with local communities. As before, health and environmental \nassessments undertaken by the relevant authorities confirmed the effectiveness of the \nemergency response actions and no water body was impacted or reached by the spilled \ncopper concentrate.  \n\nAt the time, Antamina provided comprehensive statements on its website: \n  https://www.antamina.com/noticias/comunicado-trabajos-provias-afectan-\n\nmineroducto/ \n\n  https://www.antamina.com/noticias/comenzaron-labores-limpieza-parcelas-afectadas-\n\ncerca-incidente-mineroducto/ \n\nThe Peruvian authorities regularly assessed Antamina’s operations on health and safety \nmatters. In addition, it has established a participatory environmental monitoring programme \nwith its local authorities.  \n\nWe appreciate the ongoing engagement that Glencore has with the BHRRC and are happy to \nprovide more information if required. \n\nKind regards, \n\nAnna Krutikov \nGroup Head of Sustainability"}

In 2012, Storebrand started to focus more on wages policies and purchasing practices at suppliers. In 2013, Storebrand visited H&M at its headquarters in Stockholm before H&M announced its Fair Living Wages roadmap. Organisations applauded H&M's announcement, as H&M was taking a leading role regarding this issue within the textile industry. After the announcement, Storebrand continued the dialogue regarding labour conditions and followed up on the actual implementation of H&M's commitment on living wages until 2015.\nAfter the first years of implementation, our sustainability data provider was showing how the company was making progress. It highlighted that overtime had been reduced 40% and there had been an improvement in payment structures. Therefore, at that time, we decided to allocate resources to more pressing engagement initiatives. After the summer of 2018, we resumed our engagement with the company since it seemed the company was not meeting its objectives.\nH&M has been helpful in explaining its Fair Living Wage strategy and how it has met the objectives that it set out in 2013. As the Fair Action's report states:\nH&M committed to make sure that the company's strategic suppliers should have pay structures in place to pay a fair living wage to 850 000 workers by 2018.\nThe company's focus has been on working towards creating the mentioned\npay structures\ntogether with 20 other brands by engaging via ACT (Action, Collaboration, Transformation) initiative with trade unions, governments and suppliers. Although, the company means they have been successful in creating these structures, it also admits that they have not been able to test its effectiveness in terms of raising wages across H&M group’s supply chain. It takes time to effect long-term societal structural changes. These are suppliers that are not used to engaging in collective bargaining with unions. All stakeholders need to learn the basics.\nThe strategy covers Cambodia, India, China, Indonesia, Turkey, Vietnam, Myanmar, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The company has explained that its progress should not be determined against the measure of whether 850,000 workers at strategic suppliers’ factories achieved a living wage in 2018. H&M group was explicit that it was not going to establish specific wage levels or rates at the outset of this work.\nHowever, the company shows in its website how the average take-home wage has been higher for the suppliers that are enrolled in their wage-management systems during 2017 and 2018 compared to those that are not. It also admits that these wage improvements are still well below where a fair living wage should be.\nStorebrand's dialogue with the company has focused on the implementation of purchasing practices that should lead to an increase in wages, ultimately living wages. The company so far, has not been able to provide to what extent it is sharing the cost of raising wages though the implementation of these practices. The company does not calculate if it is paying more for products coming from suppliers enrolled in wage-management systems. However, they do mention that they remove labour cost from price negotiations and that they are willing to pay more..\nAt this point, Storebrand will continue engaging with the company regarding this issue. Although, it seems that the company has made progress regarding wage-management systems or pay structures, it is still not clear to us to what extent the company is sharing the cost of raising wages with its suppliers. We will continue to engage with H&M to make the company accountable and make sure it does its very best to raise the standards in the textile industry. H&M considers itself a leader within the industry regarding this issue. We would like to make sure that it actually is. Their work could be used as an example for other textile companies that may still think that living wages are not an achievable proposition. To be that example, it is urgent that H&M continues to work for meaningful change. Storebrand will, together with other investors, continue its dialogue with the company as long as we believe it can make a difference going forward.Finally, we are extremely grateful to Fremtiden i våre hender and Fair Aciton for bringing attention to this issue, and for providing information to investors. This also makes us better responsible investors."}

Following a discussion with the suppliers, they agreed not to follow up on the cases to have them thrown out.\nEach supplier has an MoU which has been signed by factory management and local federations (affiliated with IndustriAll) agreeing on settlement benefits.\nH&M\ngroup has been in dialogue with the local unions and the National Monitoring Committee to monitor and evaluate the situation, where the dispute so far is being managed locally by the parties.  We are monitoring the situation and have made sure that the documents and agreements that have been signed are implemented by factory management and that there is a clear resolution process in place in the factories. This issue remains on our agenda and we are in contact with the suppliers, industry association, trade unions and other buyers."}

We  ensure  you  efforts  are  not  being  measured  in  order  to \nadequately assist the families of the victims and the affected communities as well as to ensure the safety of \nour operations and the non-repetition of this event.  \n\nOn March 23rd, 2019, we received the “Invitation to Respond” related to the online publication Brumadinho \ndam: NGOs urge companies and investors to use leverage and require Vale to remedy the situation1. The online \npublication mentions the weblink to 2 letters signed by 86 NGOs: (i) one directed to “companies linked to the \nactivities of Vale”, mentioning investors and business partners, and (ii) another to “companies linked to the \nsupply chain of Vale”. \n\nIn these letter – identical in content – there is an introduction with the presentation of some information and \nsome  inferences  regarding  Vale’s  operations  and  the  dam  breaks  on  25/01/2019,  in  Brumadinho,  and  on \n05/11/2015, in Mariana – ran by SAMARCO. Then, in a second part, the letter then mentions 4 points towards \nwhich the signing organizations urge the recipients to leverage and influence Vale to observe.  \n\nVale respectfully thanks for the opportunity of this Invitation to Respond by means of which will be able to \nshare up to date information and publicly present its position. \n\nFirstly, in is worth mentioning that Vale adopted a set of measures after the Fundão dam break in Mariana, \nin 2015, aiming to prevent the occurrence of a similar event in its direct operations. Even though Fundão \nwas operated by SAMARCO – a joint-venture of Vale itself and BHP Billiton – Vale could observe  and learn \nlessons with the event and about the tragedy. Since then Vale has revised its structured dam management \nsystem which encompasses technical and governance measures. Important investments were made for the \nimprovement of processes seeking always the best operational techniques and technologies in order to ensure \nthe stability of the structures. Some of the main actions part of the safety system are: \n\n  Periodical Dam Safety Reviews, with specialized companies; \n  Detailed Emergency Action Plans; \n  System of alert in events of emergency (sirens); \n  Detailed dam break studies, with in field data collecting using the high precision equipment; \n  Registration of populations downstream of structures; \n  New owned seismological network for assessment of seisms; \n  Hiring of an International Specialists Panel with reputed professionals on world Geotechnics and Risk \n\nManagement.  \n\n  Hiring  of  an  National  Specialists  Panel  with  reputed  professionals  on  Brazil  Geotechnics  and  Risk \n\nManagement.  \n\n1 https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/globalisation-human-rights/human-rights-and-environmental-rights/brumadinho-\ndam-ngos-urge-companies-and-investors-to-use-leverage-and \n\nPágina 1 de 8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f  Monitoring management system and structure inspections by means of which the identified actions \nfor ensuring the stability of each structure is automatically  attributed to the  person responsible to \nperform it; \n\n  Automated system of dam monitoring with direct communications to the monitoring management \n\nsystem; \n\n  Video monitoring system; \n  Structures information management system to ensure transparency and reliability of information; \n \nIntegration of geotechnics systems to ensure automated update of the Plan of Dams Safety.  \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that from 2015 to 2019 Vale has applied around 5 billion Brazilian reais2 in dam \nmaintenance and health and safety. Specifically, regarding dams and sterile piles 3,14 bi were invested in the \nperiod, 784 mi only on dams. Thus, the investments on dam management went from 92 million Brazilian reais \nper year in 2015 to 256 in 2019, an increase of approximately 180%3. \n\nRegarding the Fundão dam break, it is important to reclarify that after the event the Fundação Renova was \ncreated  under  the  observance  of  a  public  agreement  among  SAMARCO,  Vale,  BHP  and  public  bodies  of \ndifferent  federative  levels.  The  foundation  has  already  spent  745  million  Brazilian  reais  in  the  Mediated \nIndemnifications Program and  other  845  mi on Emergency Financial Support. In total more than 5.5  billion \nBrazilian reais were spent so far, of which 5.06 mi on reparatory measures and 0.43 on compensatory ones. \nThese  funds  correspond  to  social-economic  (3.55  mi)  and  to  (1.95  mi)  programs.  Half  of  all  the  funds  to \nFundação Renova come from by Vale itself and the other from BHP. This and more information is available at \nthe foundations’ website4. \n\nRegarding the  humanitarian immediate assistance and the integral reparation to the persons affected in \nBrumadinho Vale has set up, from the very dam break moment, a wide response.  \n\nIn  consequence  to  the  dam  break  that  reached  the  Paraopeba  river  the  use  of  water  of  the  river  was \ncontraindicated  form  Brumadinho  to  Retiro  Baixo  Hydroelectric  Power  Plan  Dam,  in  the  municipality  of \nPompéu.  Such  recommendation5  was  issued  by  the  State  Secretariats  for  Health6,  Environment  and \nSustainable  Development7  and  Agriculture,  Livestock  and  Supply8.

Besides the direct provision of water, Vale has offered water tanks to \nthe affected families having delivered 118 units so fat. \n\nEmergency construction works were ready stated in order to de-obstruct and rehabilitate the roads. The main \nobstruction, in the Alberto Flores road, is under work and will be solved by means of the construction of a \nbridge/overpass over the waste on the road. Construction works are expected to be concluded by mid-April. \nBesides that, secondary roads are constantly under maintenance in order to ensure its usability. Also in order \nto provide an alternative pathway for the community Vale has permanently16 authorized on  February 14th, \n2019 the use of its private road that goes through the Córrego do Feijão Mine. \n\nBesides  the  alternative  pathways,  Vale  has  provided  school  transportations,  ambulances  (29/day  at  peak \ndemand), cars/taxis (3786 trips so far), vans and busses (1856 seats available per daily at peak demand, 1445 \ncurrently) to assist the needs of the persons affected, including fixed routs of transportation. \n\nIn order to provide emergency support to the affected persons and families Vale has provided – apart from \nany future indemnification – donations to the families of missing or deceased persons, as well as for persons \nwith residence and/or commercial/productive activities in the “Self-Saving Zone”17.

Member of the Executive Committee at EY from 2016 to 2017.  \n\nManuel  de  Almeida  Martins  (external  independent  member)  -  Civil  Engineer  graduated  by  the  School  of \nEngineering  of  the  Federal  University  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  (UFRJ)  in  1971,  with  specialization  in  geotechnical \nengineering  and  dam  engineering.  He  carried  out  activities  for  thirty  years  in  studies,  project  detailing, \nconstruction  monitoring,  supervision,  quality  control,  monitoring  and  assessments  on  safety  of  dams  and \nfoundation works in large Brazilian companies as a geotechnical engineer and department manager specialized \nin geotechnics. In the last twenty years, he has worked as an Independent Consultant in geotechnical engineering \nfor infrastructure projects, mainly dams. \n\nMoreover, Vale has widely collaborated with all investigations voluntarily handing information, registries and \nfiles to the authorities as well as determining that all employees openly collaborate with the authorities. \n\nRegarding  the  dam  safety  verification,  risk  assessment  and  efforts  for  non-repetition,  Vale  reiterates  the \nindependent actions of the CIAESB. Besides that, considering the more conservative risk assessments some \noperations were stopped and the persons in the respective Self-Saving Zones and/or Secondary Saving Zones \nof some dams were evacuates. They are:  \n\n  Sul Superior dam, Gongo Soco Mine, Municipality of Barão de Cocais; \n  B3/B4 dams, Mar Azul Mine, Municipality of Nova Lima, District of Macacos; \n  Vargem Grande dam, in the Vargem Grande Complex, Municipality of Nova Lima; e \n\nPágina 7 de 8 \n\n \n \n\f  Forquilha I, Forquilha II, Forquilha III and Grupo dams, Fábrica Complex, Municipality of Ouro Preto. \n\nFor all persons evacuated Vale has provided temporary accommodation in hotels and rented houses. Currently \nthere are 311 families, of which 42 are now houses of family members, as they so preferred and 222 families \nare in hotels while houses are being rented for them. To these families Vale has also provided emergency \ndonation of 5,000.00 Brazilian reais, having already paid to 206 of such families and other 22 in process of \npayment and some others still in process of registration33 \n\nBesides these, other mines have had the risk level of their dams raised to 1. This elevation of risk level does \nnot point to the necessity of evacuation of Self-Saving Zones. In any case, these operations have also been \nstopped for further detailed assessment and eventual additional measures to be taken34. The structures are: \n\n  Sul Inferior dam, Gongo Soco Mine, Municipality of Barão de Cocais; \n  Auxiliary tailing to dam 5, Águas Claras Mine, Municipality of Nova Lima; \n  Tailing B and Capitão do Mato dam, Capitão do Mato Mine, Municipality of Nova Lima; \n  Maravilhas II dam, Vargem Grande Complex, Municipality of Nova Lima;  \n  Tailing Taquaras, Mar Azul Mine, Municipality of Nova Lima, Distrito de Macacos; \n  Marés II dam, Fábrica Complex, Municipality of Belo Vale; \n  Campo Grande dam, Alegria Mine, Municipality of Mariana; \n  Doutor dam, Timbopeba Mine, Municipality of Ouro Preto; \n  Tailing 2 in Pontal dams system, Itabira Complex, Municipality of Itabira; e \n  Dam VI, Córrego de Feijão Mine, Municipality of Brumadinho. \n\nFinally,  regarding  the  leverage  of  Vale’s  shareholders,  business  partners  and  suppliers  it  is  important  to \nrestate  that  Vale  is  in  constant  dialog  and  open  to  contributions  and  inquiries  from  any  shareholders  and \nstakeholders including NGOs and social movements. Vale invites all interested parties to follow the updates \non the dedicated website35. Vale also invites to follow the future publications of reports in the investigations \nconducted by the independent  committees and, at any moment,  present inquiries  to Vale so that we  may \noffer requested information as well as absorb claims. \n\nVale  reiterates  it  remains  committed  to  the  safety  of  the  operational  structures,  focused  in  the  care  and \nsupport to the affected families and open to investigations and requests of information. \n\nCordially, \n\nVale S.A. \n\n33 Current information on April 03rd, 2019. \n34 http://www.vale.com/EN/aboutvale/news/Pages/Vale-informs-on-Stability-Condition-Declarations.aspx  \n35http://www.vale.com/brasil/PT/aboutvale/servicos-para-comunidade/minas-\ngerais/atualizacoes_brumadinho/Paginas/default.aspx \n\nPágina 8 de 8"}

A publicação online traz link \npara duas cartas assinadas por 86 ONGs: (i) uma direcionada a “empresas ligadas às atividades \nda  Vale”,  mencionando  investidores  e  parceiros  da  Companhia,  e  (ii)  outra  direcionada  a \n“empresas ligadas à cadeia de fornecedores da Vale”.  \n\nNestas  correspondências,  de  idêntico  teor,  pode  ser  encontrada  uma  introdução  com  a \napresentação  de  algumas  informações e  inferências acerca  das operações  da  Vale  S.A.  e  dos \nrompimentos  de  barragens  em  25/01/2019,  em  Brumadinho,  e  05/11/2015,  em  Mariana  – \noperada pela SAMARCO. Em seguida consta das Cartas quatro pontos em relação aos quais as \nsignatárias conclamam as destinatárias a pressionar e influenciar a Vale a observar. \n\nA Vale respeitosamente agradece a oportunidade deste “Convite para Responder” por meio \ndo  qual  poderá  compartilhar  informações  atualizadas  e  apresentar  publicamente  seu \nposicionamento. \n\nInicialmente cabe ressaltar que a Vale adotou um conjunto de medidas após o rompimento da \nbarragem de Fundão, em Mariana, em 2015, a fim de evitar a ocorrência de algo semelhante \nem suas operações diretas. Embora operada pela SAMARCO, uma joint-venture entre a própria \nVale  S.A.  e  a  BHP  Billiton,  a  Vale  pode  observar  e  coletar  lições  sobre  o  ocorrido  e  sobre  a \nresposta  à  tragédia.  Desde  então  a  Vale  tem  revisto  seu  sistema  estruturado  de  gestão  de \nbarragens, que engloba diversas ações técnicas e de governança. Foram feitos investimentos na \nmelhoria de seus processos, buscando sempre as melhores técnicas operacionais e tecnologias \npara assegurar a estabilidade de suas estruturas. Abaixo algumas das principais ações que fazem \nparte desse sistema de gestão de segurança:  \n\n•  Execução  de  Revisões  Periódicas  de  Segurança  de  Barragens,  com  empresas \n\nespecializadas. \n\n•  Execução de Auditorias Externas com empresas especializadas; \n•  Elaboração de Planos de Ações Emergenciais detalhados; \n• \n•  Elaboração de estudos de dam break detalhados, com base em levantamento de campo \n\nImplantação de sistemas de alertas para situações de emergência (sirenes); \n\ncom equipamentos de alta precisão; \n\n1 “Brumadinho dam: NGOs urge companies and investors to use leverage and require Vale to remedy the \nsituation” https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/globalisation-human-rights/human-rights-and-\nenvironmental-rights/brumadinho-dam-ngos-urge-companies-and-investors-to-use-leverage-and \n\nPágina 1 de 9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f•  Execução do cadastramento da população a jusante das estruturas; \n• \nImplantação de rede sismológica própria para avaliação de sismos; \n•  Contratação de Painel de Especialistas Internacional, com profissionais renomados da \n\nárea de Geotecnia e de Gestão de Riscos mundial; \n\n•  Contratação de um Painel de Especialistas Nacional, com profissionais renomados da \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n• \n\n• \n\nárea de Geotecnia e de Gestão de Riscos do Brasil; \nImplantação de sistema de gestão de monitoramento e inspeção das estruturas, onde \nas  ações  identificadas  para  garantia  da  estabilidade  da  estrutura  já  são  distribuídas \nautomaticamente para os responsáveis; \nImplantação  de  sistema  automatizado  de  monitoramento  nas  barragens,  com \ncomunicação direta com o sistema de monitoramento; \nImplantação de sistema de vídeo monitoramento; \nImplantação  de  sistema  de  gestão  de  informações  das  estruturas,  garantindo  a \ntransparência e confiabilidade das informações; \nIntegração dos sistemas de geotecnia garantindo a atualização automática do Plano de \nSegurança de Barragens. \n\nCabe  destacar  que  no  período  de  2015  a  2019  a  Vale  aplicou  cerca  de  5  bilhões  de  reais  na \nmanutenção de barragens e em saúde e segurança. Especificamente em barragens e pilhas de \nestéril  foram  investidos  3,14  bilhões  de  reais  no  período,  784  milhões  exclusivamente  em \nbarragens. Com isso os investimentos em gestão de barragens passaram de 92 milhões de reais \npor ano em 2015 para 256 milhões em 2019, um aumento de aproximadamente 180%2. \n\nEm relação ao rompimento da barragem de Fundão, é importante reforçar que foi estabelecida \na  Fundação  Renova,  criada  em  observância  a  um  acordo  público  entre  SAMARCO,  Vale,  BHP \nBilliton  e  órgãos  públicos  de  diferentes  níveis  federativos.  Desde  sua  criação  a  fundação  já \nrealizou 745 milhões de reais no Programa de Indenizações Mediadas e 845 milhões em Auxílio \nFinanceiro Emergencial. No total já foram empregados 5,5 bilhões de reais, dos quais 5,06 em \nações reparatórias e 0,43 bilhão em ações compensatórias. Estes recostos correspondem tanto \na programas socioeconômicos (3,55 milhões de reais) quanto socioambientais (1,95 milhões de \nreais). Metade destes recursos da Fundação Renova é proveniente da Vale e a outra metade da \nBHP  Billiton.  Estas  informações  e  maiores  detalhamentos  estão  disponíveis  no  website  da \nFundação3. \n\nA respeito da assistência humanitária imediata e da reparação integral das pessoas atingidas \nem Brumadinho, a Vale estruturou, a partir do momento do rompimento, ampla resposta. \n\nEm consequência do rompimento da Barragem I, que atingiu o Rio Paraopeba, foi contraindicada \na captação e utilização de água do rio de Brumadinho até a Barragem da Hidroelétrica de Retiro \nBaixo, no município de Pompéu. Tal recomendação foi expedida pelas Secretarias de Estado de \nSaúde (“SES”), de Meio Ambiente e Desenvolvimento Sustentável (“SEMAD”), e de Agricultura, \nPecuária e Abastecimento (“SEAPA”)4.

Primeiramente, a Vale utilizou a base de dados fornecida \npela Empresa de Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural do Estado de Minas Gerais (“EMATER”) \ncom o mapeamento das propriedades rurais nas áreas atingidas. Além disso, a equipe da Vale \npassou a fazer busca ativa das propriedades rurais com eventual falta de acesso adequado à \nágua, recebendo também informações e demandas diretamente nos Pontos de Atendimento \nlocais em Brumadinho pelos telefones Alô Ferrovia 0800 285 7000, Alô Brumadinho 0800 031 \n0831 e Ouvidoria Vale 0800 821 5000 (e pelo posteriormente criado Central de Água (21) 3485-\n6632 \nemail \nfrenteagropecuaria_brumadinho@vale.com,  e  em  reuniões  locais  com  as  comunidades  e \nprodutores rurais. \n\ninclusive), \n\nligações \n\ncobrar, \n\npara \n\npelo \n\n– \n\na \n\nAté o momento, mais de 56,44 milhões de litros d’água potável6 já foram entregues pela Vale \naos atingidos, tanto para consumo humano, animal e irrigação. Até o momento destes mais de \n1,22 milhoes litros d’água mineral envasada. Além do fornecimento direto de água, a Vale tem \noferecido caixas d’água aos atingidos, já tendo entregue cerca de 118 unidades. \n\nObras  emergenciais  foram  prontamente  iniciadas  a  fim  de  desobstruir  e  reabilitar  acessos \nviários  bloqueados.  A  principal  obstrução,  na  estrada  local  Alberto  Flores,  está  sendo \nsolucionada mediante a construção de ponte sobre o rejeito que obstrui a pista. A previsão de \nfinalização das obras é dia 10/04/2019. Além disso, vias secundárias vem sendo constantemente \nsubmetidas a manutenções a fim de garantir sua usabilidade. A fim de disponibilizar caminho \nalternativo,  e  atendendo  pedidos  dos  atingidos,  a  Vale  autorizou,  a  partir  de  14/02/2019  a \nutilização de estrada privada que passa por dentro da Mina Córrego do Feijão. \n\nAlém das alternativas de acesso, a Vale tem disponibilizado transporte escolar, ambulâncias (29 \npor dia no pico da demanda), carros/taxis (3.786 viagens até o momento), van e ônibus (1856 \nassentos  disponíveis  por  dia  no  pico  da  demanda,  atualmente  1445),  para  atendimento  às \nnecessidades dos atendidos, inclusive com rotas fixas de transporte. \n\nA  fim  de  prover  apoio  emergencial  às  pessoas  atingidas  e  sem  caráter  indenizatório  a  Vale \nestabeleceu uma frente de doações referente às pessoas desaparecidas ou falecidas, bem como \nreferentes  às  moradias  e  atividades  comerciais  e/ou  produtivas  localizadas  nas  Zonas  de \nAutossalvamento (“ZAS”). Estas doações, sem natureza de antecipação de indenização, estão \nsendo pagas aos atingidos da seguinte forma: \n\n•  A doação no valor de 100 mil reais é destinada a representantes de empregados da Vale, \nde trabalhadores terceirizados e de pessoas da comunidade falecidos ou desaparecidos, \nconforme \nlista  oficial  validada  pela  Defesa  Civil  e  disponibilizada  no  site \nvale.com/brumadinho.

Até o momento8 foram efetivadas 271 doações desta categoria.  \n\n•  A  Vale  oferece  doação  no  valor  de  R$  50  mil  para  aqueles  que  moram  na  Zona  de \nAutossalvamento  (ZAS)  do  Plano  de  Ação  de Emergência  de Barragens  de Mineração \n(PAEBM). Os registros para recebimento destas doações foram iniciados em 11/02, de \nacordo com os critérios também amplamente divulgados e disponíveis site9 da Vale. Até \no momento10 foram efetivadas 94 doações desta categoria, estando outras 3 em fase \nde pagamento. \n\n•  Por  sua  vez,  para  as  pessoas  com  atividades  produtivas  e/ou  comerciais  total  ou \nparcialmente dentro das ZAS a Vale disponibilizou a doação de R$15.000,00. Os registros \ntambém foram iniciados em 11/02 observando os critérios igualmente divulgados de \nforma  ampla  e  disponíveis  no  site11  da  Vale.  Até  o  momento12  foram  efetivadas  78 \ndoações desta categoria e 03 estão em fase de pagamento. \n\nÉ fundamental ressaltar que as três categorias de doação não se tratam de indenizações, que \nserão  acordadas  entre  as  partes  em  conjunto  com  as  autoridades.  A  doação  pode  ser \ncumulativa, caso a pessoa se enquadre em mais de uma categoria entre as definidas: residência, \natividade  produtiva  rural  ou  estabelecimento  comercial.  No  total,  até  o  momento,  já  foram \npagos R$33.020.000,00 em doações aos atingidos de Brumadinho. \n\nAlém  destas  doações,  a  Vale  tem  providenciado  transporte  e  hospedagem  para  atingidos \ndeslocados  ou  desabrigados,  familiares  acompanhando  atingidos  hospitalizados  e  familiares \nacompanhando buscas e reconhecimento de corpos no Instituto Médico Legal.   \n\nAdemais, a Vale tem provido moradias provisórias para as pessoas que se encontram em hotéis \ne não podem retornar às suas moradias seja por terem sido diretamente afetadas pela lama \napós o rompimento, seja por estarem interditadas pelo poder público em razão de segurança \nou fitossanitária. No total são, atualmente, 90 núcleos familiáres. Já foram alugadas e entregues \nmoradias  mobiliadas  para  70  famílias  e  outras  13  famílias  em  processo  de  acomodação \nencontram-se em hoteis e outras 7 se encontram em casas de familiares, por assim preferirem.13 \nNos casos em que foi possível levar a mobília prévia das famílias ela foi levada e complementada \nquando  necessário.  Nos  demais  casos,  mobília  nova  tem  sido  provida.  Ressalta-se  que  a \ndisponibilização  de  moradia  temporária  inclui  pagamento  de  aluguel  e  despesas  fixas  (IPTU, \nágua, luz, gás) até o fechamento da indenização; Kit mobiliário e enxoval padrão; Transporte \npara  mudança  de  bens  de  interesse  das  pessoas/famílias  para  as  moradias  temporárias, \nincluindo animais domésticos; Ração para animais domésticos; Cesta básica mensal até o início \ndo pagamento da antecipação da indenização. Para as famílias que optarem por residir em casa \nde parentes, serão disponibilizados o complemento de mobília e de enxoval para acomodação \nda família na moradia. \n\n7 http://www.vale.com/brasil/PT/aboutvale/news/Paginas/Vale-inicia-registro-para-doacao-de-100-mil-\npor-fatalidades-e-desaparecimentos.aspx \n8 Dados de 03/04/2018. \n9 http://www.vale.com/brasil/PT/aboutvale/news/Paginas/Vale-inicia-hoje-registro-para-doacao-de-50-\ne-15-mil-para-atingidos-em-Zona-de-Autossalvamento.aspx \n10 Dados de 03/04/2019. \n11 Ver nota 9. \n12 Dados de 03/04/2019. \n13 Dados de 03/04/2019. \n\nPágina 4 de 9 \n\n \n \n                                                 \n \n\fA título de indenização emergencial, a Vale comprometeu-se a pagar valores mensais a todos os \nmoradores de Brumadinho e as populações ribeirinhas até a Barragem da Hidroelétrica de Retiro \nBaixo, no município de Pompéu. Os valores mensais serão de 1 salário mínimo por adulto, 1/2 \nsalário mínimo por adolescente, e 1/4 para crianças, a partir de 25 de janeiro, pelo prazo de um \nano14.  Em  audiência  realizada  no  dia  04/04/2019,  na  6ª  Vara  da  Fazenda  Pública  Estadual  e \nAutarquias,  em  Belo  Horizonte,  a  Vale  acordou  que  os  pagamentos  emergenciais  não  serão \ndescontados  das \nindividuais  e  serão  compensados  dos  danos  coletivos \nsocioeconômicos a serem apurados ao final do processo. Até o momento, mais de 3.000 pessoas \njá receberam os pagamentos emergenciais e mais de 12.000 agendamentos já foram realizados \npelo 0800 nos sete postos de registro abertos. \n\nindenizações \n\nAdemais,  a  Vale  se  comprometeu,  mediante  acordo  celebrado  durante  Audiência  em \n07/03/2019 da Ação Civil Pública15 e pedido de Tutela Antecipada Antecedente16, a pagar valor \nequivalente a uma cesta básica por núcleo familiar, conforme padrão DIEESE17, aos moradores \ndo Parque da Cachoeira e Córrego do Feijão pelo período de 12 meses contados de 25/01/2019. \n\nA  Vale  se  pauta  pelo  respeito  e  valorização  de  seus  empregados  próprios  e  os  de  suas \ncontratadas  e  pelo  respeito  integral  à  liberdade  sindical  dos  trabalhadores.

Even though we do not comment on individual cases, we would like to generally\ndescribe our internal processes that come into play once we are alerted by such events from outside sources.\nWe have established a so-called “Ad-hoc case” process that is triggered once we receive hints on violations against our Code of Conduct for business partners on topics such as human rights, labor standards, environment and anti-corruption. These hints can come from victims of alleged abuses like workers in the supply chain and other affected groups and can also be triggered by media reports or by NGO reports.\nUpon receiving such hints, we have to establish whether it is a company in our supply chain and the plausibility of these hints. This may include that we assemble\nan ad-hoc team that is built from sustainability experts from VW Group sustainability in supply chains and from local experts from the respective brands and regions. If we detect violations or can confirm the accusations, the supplier is asked to fill out a so-called 6D report in which they can report on the case and mitigating and corrective measures. This may also include an on-site check at the supplier site\n.\nWe then check if the corrective measures are adequate.\nWe are always interested in developing our suppliers and not to simply terminate a business relationship. Nevertheless, where the supplier is not willing or not able to comply with our requirements, the business relationship may be terminated or not renewed. In 2018, this was the case for 18 suppliers with whom we either cancelled business or blocked them for further sourcing.\nIt is our primary concern to prevent violations against our code of conduct through continuous risk management and processes. However, we are well aware that no company will be able to 100% exclude abuses in their supply chain and have thus established various channels through which we can receive grievances. Such an early warning system enables us to address violations and prevent systematic problems in the supply chain. While these various grievance mechanisms (e-mail, ombudsman, and whistleblowing hotline\nto report violations of the law or regulations of VW employees) are communicated broadly, they still might not be able to detect all violations. This is why we very much appreciate the work of BHRRC and other NGOs and encourage you to get in contact with us immediately once you receive further information on human rights abuses that might be in relation with our business."}

We recognize the need for greater transparency as raised by the InfluenceMap report... Shell recently published an Industry Associations Climate Review, which assesses Shell's alignment with 19 key industry associations on climate-related policy... We have been clear about our support for the Paris Agreement and the need for society to transition to a lower-carbon future, but the InfluenceMap report appears to suggest that any extended role of fossil fuels in the energy system is incompatible with the goals of Paris... IEA data suggest that natural gas will have a role to play... Shell recognizes that the future energy system must be made of products which, on average, have a lower carbon intensity... Society must also contend with the carbon dioxide emissions that cannot be avoided. We are strong proponents of government led carbon pricing, carbon capture and storage, and nature-based solutions as means of addressing emissions... Shell is taking concrete steps to address our own carbon footprint and we intend to cut the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell in step with society as it moves towards the goal of the Paris Agreement."}

Our strategy, \nwhich  encompasses  investments  not  only  in  the  oil  business  but  also  in  natural  gas  and  low  carbon \nelectricity businesses, involves gradually decreasing the carbon intensity of of the energy products used \nby our customers.  \nMore than ever, we are fully committed to contribute to supply to as many people as possible a more \naffordable, more available and cleaner energy  while responding to growing consumer energy demand  \nand in particular for electricity and contributing to tackle the climate challenge. \n\nWe are moreover committed to providing robust reporting on issues relating to climate change. Thus, \nwe decided in 2016, with the full support of Total’s Board, to voluntarily publish each year a dedicated \nreport on the integration of climate challenges into the Group’s strategy. The last version of this report \nwas published on September 2018. \n\nWith  respect  to  corporate  lobbying  regarding  climate  change,  we  have  taken note  of  Influence  Map’s \nreport (as made available through the aforementioned article). Although we believe the conclusions of \nthat report are not accurate as far as Total is concerned, we do not propose to respond in detail to it, but \nwish to share the following: \n\nTransparency and collective action are, in our view, essential to deal with climate change challenges. Total \nis  therefore  involved  in  multiple  international  initiatives  such  as  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD), the Oil and Gas Climate  Initiative (OGCI), the  Climate  Leadership Council, \nGlobal Compact and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. \n\nIn  January  2016, Total  published  a  Lobbying Ethics Charter which  requires  all entities  of the  Group  to \ncomply with our Code of Conduct in carrying out any lobbying activities and states in particular that such \nentities  will  convey  messages  that  are  consistent  with  our  stated  positions  and  strategies.  Under  this \ncharter,  all  lobbying  activities  are  carried  out  in  compliance  with  applicable  regulations  and  in  a \ntransparent manner. Total has been registered since 2008 in the EU transparency register and, since 2017, \nin  the  French  transparency  directory (“Répertoire  de  la  Haute  Autorité  pour  la Transparence  de  la  Vie \nPublique”). \n\nIn  relation  to  professional  associations,  we  are  members  of  many  national  and  international  trade \nassociations, whose names are public.  In defining their position on any given issue, these associations \nmust seek a consensus between their members. This consensus does not always reflect our position and, \nwhen this is the case, we do not hesitate to express this. However, we think it is better to work from the \ninside to promote our ideas with a view to trying to convince our peers rather than removing ourselves \nfrom the discussion. \n\nWe publish on our website a list of all professional associations in which Total is involved. Our participation \nin professional organisations does not prevent us from speaking up and communicating our own position, \nwhere this differs from that of the associations from which we are members. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fWe are undertaking in 2019 a review of Total’s participation in the main professional associations to assess \nwhether  their  public  policy  statements  on  climate  are  in  line  with  Total’s  positions  and  what  further \nactions we should consider, as the case may be, vis-à-vis certain of these associations."}

Access to justice: legal and practical obstacles \n\nPredicating the Global Compact’s response to serious human rights and environmental harms,\nlike those caused by the disaster at Brumadinho, on a final legal determination of the\ncompany’s responsibility ensures in many cases that no action will be taken. Indeed, such a\npolicy lets the worst actors—those who refuse to admit wrong—and/or those operating in\njurisdictions with weak governance or regulatory oversight—where official investigations or\nauthoritative determinations of responsibility are unlikely or not timely—off the hook. The\nrequirement that official investigations conclude that a company involved in gross human\nrights abuses and serious environmental damages is responsible for such impacts before the\nGlobal Compact opts to de-list such company in practice guarantees that the company will\nface no penalty. This is because, in the context of countries where the judiciary is for many\nreasons dysfunctional, as is the case of Brazil, the delivery of a final judgment may take\nyears, if not decades.  \n\nThe case of the Rio Doce disaster, following the collapse of the Fundão iron ore tailings dam\nin Mariana,\nillustrates the slowness of official investigations and many of the endemic\nproblems that stymie efforts at holding corporations accountable for environmental crimes\nin both civil and criminal\nand egregious human rights abuses. Such problems exist\nprocedures. \n\n8\n\nthe three companies involved in the Rio Doce disaster (Samarco, Vale and BHP\nFirst,\nBilliton) have paid only a tiny fraction of the fines levied against them. The figures vary from\n3.4 to 7% . Fines remain unpaid because companies pursue an aggressive strategy of\nchallenging these financial sanctions in the courts, which take years to issue a ruling. Thus,\nfines are not an effective instrument of deterrence in relation to disaster prevention. \n\n9\n\nSecond, criminal investigations are by their very nature complex processes that seek to\nestablish individual responsibility for conduct that caused the harms at issue. In the context of\na complex organization such as a big mining company, attributing the actions or omissions\nthat resulted in a dam failure to specific individuals is a daunting task. It comes as no\nsurprise, therefore, that courts, in non-final decisions, have rejected prosecutors’ attempts to\n\nEmpresas envolvidas em desastres ambientais quitaram só 3,4% de R$ 785 milhões em \n\n8 Danielle Nogueira. \nmultas\n.

The courts are more sympathetic to the\ndefendants’ claims that the crime to be charged is exposing the environment and people to\ndanger, with deaths as an aggravating component. Moreover, the criminal case has been\nstalled. The case was filed in October 2016, almost a year after the dam collapse, and since\nthen no one was convicted, two out of the 21 defendants were absolved, and the case was\nsuspended for over nine months.\n\n10\n\nThe determination of corporate criminal liability is similarly complex. Brazilian criminal law\nprovides that legal persons may be held criminally liable for environmental crimes, and the\nBrazilian Supreme Federal Court ruled that criminal liability in such cases does not depend\non the correspondent liability of any natural person. However, judges in lower courts are\nstill hesitant to find a company criminally liable without holding individuals liable as well.  \n\n11\n\nAttempts at holding the companies civilly liable have been similarly complicated because the\ncompanies and authorities have opted for an extrajudicial settlement agreement, the problems\nwith which have been addressed in detail elsewhere. Nonetheless, in occasions where courts\nhave been called to settle conflicts or to correct the failures of the extrajudicial mechanism,\nthe judiciary has placed obstacles for effective remediation. An example is a judicial decision\nthat restricted the eligibility of entities that could perform the economic assessment of the\ndamages caused by the Fundão dam collapse.  \n\n12\n\nOverall, the judiciary has not acted with the necessary level of leadership to coordinate the\nnegotiations between the companies and the public authorities. This has caused the whole\nprocess to be delayed, creating severe problems for the affected people.

This means that families will be living in temporary lodging for 6\nyears, with demonstrated profound impacts on their psychological health.\n\n 13\n\nEm dois anos, ação contra executivos e mineradoras por tragédia de Mariana sofre 9 meses de \n\nhttps://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/em-dois-anos-acao-contra-mineradoras-por-19-homicidios\n\n10 Luiz Vassallo. \n.

Regardless of Vale's right to use all legitimate judicial and extrajudicial\nmeans of defense in favor of itself and its employees, the most important obligation\non the part of the company is to restore its \"social license to operate\", which depends\non a balance between legal rationality and social and extra-legal accountability. \n\n● Adequacy of extrajudicial mechanisms to international standards\n\n: Standards\ngoverning non-judicial grievance mechanisms include the UN Guiding Principles on\nBusiness and Human Rights, specifically Principle 31, which stipulates that such\nmechanisms should be accessible, predictable, transparent, equitable, participatory\nand based on rights.

The independence of remedial\nmechanisms should be guaranteed. Mediation mechanisms should be guided by the\nfundamental principles of this type of conflict resolution, avoiding the confusion of\nroles, conflicts of interest, and the process being controlled by the party with greater\neconomic power, meaning the company/companies. Decisions regarding the scope\nand definition of the affected population, the dimension of the impacts, and the\ntechnical and legal assistance required, must be carried out by independent and bona\nfide entities, trusted by those affected. \n\n● Promoting human rights and strengthening the normative framework:\nBusinesses do not thrive in a society where institutions - which dictate the rules of the\ngame - are dysfunctional and/or operate exclusively in favor of the economic and\ninterests of privileged groups. As one of the measures to guarantee\npolitical\nnon-repetition, Vale must establish a public commitment\nto use its political,\neconomic, and social capital to improve the normative framework and strengthen\npublic policies on prevention and reparation of social and environmental disasters.\nThis is the expected and necessary conduct after being involved in two massive\ndisasters, and can be achieved by drawing lessons, so as to turn sad and preventable\nepisodes into a positive legacy for society. Political activity must observe the\nobligations of transparency and accountability, ensuring that society knows if and\nhow the company engages in normative and/or public policy debates. The company\nshould review its business and investment decisions to ensure that they do not\nencourage measures that weaken public policies and standards. \n\n● High-level commitment to institutional human rights policies and due diligence:\nresponsibility is not always\nThe understanding of social and environmental\naccompanied by a genuine commitment at\nlevels of company\nmanagement, which in practice compromises institutional human rights policies,\nwhose effects end up not influencing business decisions.

These services should be provided by the competent public\nagencies (CRAS, CREAS, CAPS, etc.), with financial support from the company. \n● The company must make every possible effort to conduct its future mining activities\n\nwithout dams (dry mining). \n\n● The company must apply the best international standards for dam safety until all of\n\nthem are decommissioned and deactivated.  \n\n● The company must publish a clear timeframe for safely decommissioning and\n\ndeactivating its dams. \n\n● The company must adopt the best international standards for reparations with a view\n\nto restoring the rights of those affected to the greatest extent possible; \n\n● The company must observe the principle of the centrality of the suffering of the\nvictims in the process of reparation of the damages, recognizing and respecting the\ncentrality and autonomy of those affected by the disaster; \n\n● The company must disclose socio-environmental impact assessments, declarations of\nstability of structures, as well as other relevant documents. This document should be\navailable to investors, allowing them to make informed investment decisions. \n\n● The company must present a clear timeframe for the restoration of normality in\ncommunities affected by the disaster, as well as in other communities currently under\nrisk (Ouro Preto, Nova Lima, Barão de Cocais, Itatiaiuçu). For example, families\nshould know for how long they will stay in hotels, and whether they will be able to\npick up their belongings in the houses that have been compulsorily abandoned. \n\n● The company must present a detailed emergency plan for the possibility of other dam\nfailures.

We welcome the opportunity to \nprovide a response to the allegations made in the report. \n\nColombia \nThe dispute between Glencore’s Prodeco coal asset and the Colombian Government stems \nfrom a 2010 amendment to the Mining Contract for the Calenturitas mine. \n\nIn 2008, we proposed to expand the Calenturitas mine to increase coal production and \nextend the life of the mine. The expansion plan involved Glencore making substantial \ninvestments. The original royalty regime applicable to the Calenturitas mine would have \nbecome punitive in respect of the expansion to increase production. After 20 months of \ndiscussion, and in order to enable a significant expansion of the Calenturitas mine, the \ngovernment and Prodeco/Glencore agreed an amendment to the royalty regime through an \namendment to the Calenturitas Mining Contract, executed in January 2010. \n\nRegrettably, after the amendment was signed by both parties, and significant investments \nhad been made to expand the mine on the basis of the amendment, the government sought \nto revoke and nullify the amendment that Colombia had signed.  \n\nThe Swiss-Colombia Treaty requires that Colombia abide by the commitments it makes to \ninvestors like Glencore and Prodeco, and it requires that Colombia treat Glencore and \nProdeco’s investments fairly and equitably. Glencore initiated a consultation process with \nthe Columbian government in order to settle the dispute amicably. Unfortunately, the \namicable negotiations under the treaty were not successful and we filed an arbitration claim \nbefore ICSID in March 2016. \n\nThe arbitration proceedings have now concluded and we anticipate receiving the judgement \nshortly. \n\nBolivia \nIn July 2016, Glencore began arbitration proceedings against Bolivia over the nationalisation \nof these three assets by the Evo Morales government. While Glencore does not dispute \nBolivia’s sovereign right to nationalise its investments, under international law and the \napplicable bilateral investment treaty for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, \nBolivia must pay fair and effective compensation. \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

However, after almost nine years of negotiations without receiving any \ncompensation for the nationalisation of three of its assets, Glencore had no other option but \nto initiate arbitration proceedings to enforce its rights under international law. \n\nGlencore is committed to Bolivia and wants to continue to develop our working relationship \nwithin the country despite having three assets nationalised in 2007, 2010 and 2012. We \nwork with the government as our 55% partner in our Bolivian operations.  \n\nGlencore has and continues to make substantial contributions to Bolivia and its people.

Glencore Agriculture's board is\ncomprised of Glencore, CPPIB and BCI representatives. Our head office has been based\nin Rotterdam since the 1980s.\n\nGlencore Agriculture plays an important role in the global agricultural supply chain.\nWe have strong relationships with producers and farming cooperatives in the main\nexport areas, sourcing grains, oilseeds, pulses, sugar and cotton and supplying them\nand value-added products to customers around the world.\n\nWe market to food manufacturers, animal feed manufacturers, consumer product\nprocessors, local importers and distributors and governments around the world.

Our major investments in logistics and\ninfrastructure allow producers to access a wide range of markets where they would\notherwise be limited in their ability to sell their produce. Efficient supply chains help\nmaintain cross border food and feed availability, meeting the needs of customers when\nfood shortages occur.\n\nThe supply chain efficiencies we generate can in turn lead to real environmental\nbenefits from economies of scale in transport and logistics. We move larger volumes of\nproduct through more efficient means, which avoids higher numbers of less efficient\nshort, low-volume, train, truck and ship movements. We also make significant\ninvestments in food safety and quality assurance so that customers can be confident that\nour food and feed products meet international standards.\n\nOur approach to sustainability\n\nOur approach to sustainability follows that of the Glencore Group. It encompasses all of\nour workforce, the entire value chain of each of our commodities and every community\nwhere we operate.\n\nOur code of conduct sets out the standards we require people to meet and understand.\nThis code puts our values into practice and informs our daily actions and decisions. In\naddition, we have a range of policies which set out our strategic positions and form part\nof our corporate decision-making.\n\nProgress is monitored by our Health, Safety, Environment and Communities committee,\nthe Group sustainability team and relevant business leads to keep it in line with the\nneeds of our business.\n\nWe regularly share our performance, learnings and experiences with all internal\nstakeholders and management around the world to ensure everyone remains informed,\nand benefits from being a part of our global network.\n\nThrough our memberships in various industry associations, we can address specific\nissues within agricultural industry, including supply chain concerns.\n\nFor example, in late 2018, Glencore Agriculture became a participant of the United\nNations Global Compact'.\n\n Glencore ple has been a participant since 2014\nGlencore Agriculture B.V.\nP.O, Box 1120 - 3300 BC Rotterdam - Netherlands\nBlaak 31 - 3011 GA Rotterdam\nTelephone +31 10 4044 400 * www.glencoreagriculture.com\n\n\n\nGLENCORE\n\nAGRICULTURE LIMITED\n\nAs a member, Glencore Agriculture pledges to:\n\n* implement changes to business operations and strategy, incorporating the Ten\nPrinciples of the UN Global Compact, including in subsidiaries and the supply\nchain\n\n* support the UN Global Compact and the Ten Principles via available\ncommunications channels\n\n* inform stakeholders annually of its efforts to implement the UN Global\nPrinciples, and post this Communication on Progress (COP) on the UN Global\nCompact website.\n\nEradicating deforestation\n\nGlencore Agriculture is committed to eliminating deforestation from its value chains. To\nprotect the environment, we believe demand from world population growth and\ngreater wealth should be met from higher yields and efficient supply chains as opposed\nto greater use of land.\n\nWe work collaboratively with fellow industry members, producers and suppliers along\nour supply chains as well as governments and organisations to eradicate deforestation,\nincrease sustainability and protect high carbon stock forests, valuable conservation\nareas and peatlands from uncontrolled expansion.\n\nAs part of this, we are a member of the Round Table of Responsible Soy (RTRS) and a\nlong-term participant in the Amazon Soy Moratorium.\n\nSupporting supply chain transparency\n\nIn 2018, Glencore Agriculture joined the World Business Council for Sustainable\nDevelopment and in 2019 joined its Soft Commodities Forum (SCF). Members of the\nSCF participate in a common framework for reporting and monitoring progress on\ntransparent and traceable supply chains for soy in Brazil's Cerrado region. The first SCF\nreport was released on 6 June 2019 and further reports are expected to be released every\nsix months.\n\nGlencore Agriculture owned farming land\n\nWe operate in a transparent and responsible way with our suppliers, business partners,\ncustomers, stakeholders and communities to ensure mutual benefit and build trust for\nall parties.\n\nGlencore Agriculture exited farming operations in Ukraine in 2017 and in Australia in\nearly 2018, which comprised a combination of owned and leased land.

This  objective  commits  the  States,  which  are  responsible  for  deciding  both  the \nnational objectives to be set in order to respect the global objective of well below 2°C and the measures \nto be implemented to achieve them in the various sectors.  \n\nTotal supports the objectives of the Paris agreement, and has integrated the challenges of climate change \ninto its strategy. This strategy, which encompasses investments not only in the oil business but also in \nnatural gas and low-carbon electricity businesses, involves gradually decreasing the carbon intensity of \nthe energy products used by our customers. \n\nTotal  takes  into  account  in  its  strategy  the  evolutions  of  the  energy  markets  as  presented  by  the \nInternational  Energy  Agency  in  the  horizon  2040,  especially  in  the  sustainable  development  scenario, \nwhich refers to a global average temperature well below 2 °C.  \n\nIn order to contribute to achieve this target, Total made a commitment in 2019 to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions (scopes 1 et 2) from its operated oil and gas facilities, from 46 Mt CO2e  in 2015 to less than 40 \nMt CO2e in 2025. \n\nTotal also has the ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of energy products used by its customers by \n15% between 2015, date of the Paris Agreement, and 2030. In the longer term, beyond 2030, our ambition \nis  to  pursue  these  efforts,  or  possibly  to  accelerate  as  new  technologies  become  available  and  public \npolicies are put in place, and reach a reduction of 25 to 35% by 2040.  \nThis carbon intensity has already been reduced from 75 gCO2e/kBtu in 2015 to 71 gCO2e/kBtu in 2018, a \ndecrease of more than 5%. \n\nThis path represents a positive contribution by Total towards achieving the objectives  set by the Paris \nAgreement, while enabling it to fulfill its commitment to supply to as many people as possible a more \naffordable, more available and cleaner energy while responding to growing consumer energy demand and \nin particular for electricity. \n\nTotal reports in details its actions regarding the challenges of climate change. In 2016, Total was the first \noil and gas Major to publish a brochure dedicated to the consideration of climate issues and detailing the \nGroup’s lines of action in this area. Total’s position on climate are public and the Group reports its actions \nthrough its Registration Document in line with the recommendations of Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosure (TCFD).  \nReference Document:  https://www.total.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/ddr2018-en.pdf \nClimate Strategy:  https://www.total.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/total_climat_2018_en.pdf  \n\nTotal encourages dialog with its stakeholders and is open to exchange on climate issues and the challenges \nthey represent. However, the associations signatories of this report have never expressed their willingness \nto open dialog with the Group on these issues.  \n\n1"}

Through its field \nlevel partners, BCI has trained nearly 9,500 farmers in Xinjiang since 2012. Decent Work \nprinciples are embedded in the Better Cotton Standard and in six years of third-party \nverification visits in Xinjiang, there have been no reported cases of forced labour or child labour \non BCI licensed farms.  \n\nXinjiang cotton is processed into yarn in various parts of China, including in the region itself. \nadidas holds no direct relationship with the spinning mills that produce the yarn. Our \nmanufacturing partners buy the finished materials that go into our products from fabric mills, \nwho in turn are supplied yarn from spinning mills around the world, including China. \n\nThere were media reports claiming that a yarn producer, Huafu, which has spinning operations \nin Aksu, was linked to re-education programs in Xinjiang. Our position on forced labour is very \nclear and is well known to our business partners and to their subordinate suppliers. We strictly \nprohibit forced labour, including all forms of prison labour, in our own operations and in our \nsupply chain. \n\nHuafu operates 5 spinning plants in various locations across China and Vietnam and, indirectly, \nsupplies yarn to many international apparel brands. On learning of these allegations, we asked \nour materials suppliers to immediately suspend any sourcing of yarn from Huafu Aksu, to allow \nus time to investigate.  \n\nAlthough we have no direct contractual relationship with Huafu, we asked for access to audit \ntheir spinning facilities in Aksu. They obliged. Our investigations found no evidence of forced \nlabour, or of government involvement in the hiring of their workforce.  \n\nDespite these findings our suspension of Huafu Aksu continues pending receipt of a third-party \nassessment by an independent consultancy specializing in forced labour. We are hopeful that \nthose investigations will verify our own preliminary audit results. \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIt is important that brands engage with concerned stakeholders to discuss the human rights \nsituation in the region and the impact this has on employment and the workplace.

We are currently engaged with the Fair Labor Association, the Better Cotton Initiative \nand others, to strengthen assurance processes and map a way forward. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \nAsia Pacific \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

For the purpose of using certain land area in Sorowako for its infrastructures, PTVI submitted \nan  application  to  the  Government  in  1973.  Following  such  application,  PTVI  paid \ncompensation in 1975 to the entitled land owners in accordance with a Decree which was \nissued by the Regional Government based on appraisals conducted by a land compensation \ncommittee formed by the Regional Government. \n\nc. \n\nIn  1976,  the  Karonsi’e  Dongi  people  gradually  came  to  Sorowako  claiming  that  they \npreviously  inhabited  Sorowako  and  its  surrounding  area  since  before  the  1950s,  and, \nbecause of rebels seeking to establish an Islamic state following Indonesia’s independence \ncalled DI/TII they alleged that they were forced to leave their home. Following their return \nin 1977, PTVI paid additional compensation to the Karonsi’e Dongi people. \n\nd.  Vale works very closely with local government to identify and address legitimate indigenous \nissues.  After a long process and several discussions and correspondence with the Karonsi’e \nDongi people, certain human rights organizations and the Regional/Local Government, the \n\nPage 1 of 7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\flocal government issued a Decree on the relocation of the Karonsi’e Dongi community.  In \nApril 2008, an agreement was reached between the Ministry of Public Housing, PTVI, and \nthe  Government  of  Luwu  Timur  to  construct  a  settlement  area  in  Ledu-Ledu  village, \nWasuponda sub-district. All parties contributed to build the area.  \n\ne.  At the time,  some  Karonsi’e Dongi people chose not  to relocate and built huts along the \noutskirts of PTVI’s Contract of Work (COW) area. Today, the community grows bigger. The \nmajority of the community is no longer comprised of descendants of Karonsi’e Dongi. When \nthe community was informally established, it obtained electricity by  making an improper \nand illegal connection to PTVI’s power lines. At the time, PTVI warned residents about the \nrisk of electricity overload and the potential safety issues but the warnings went unheeded. \nThis improper and illegal connection caused an overload to PTVI’s “disconnecting switch” \nresulting  in  an  explosion,  connection  loss  and  certain  other  accidents.    Due  to  these \naccidents, the electricity connection made by the Karonsi’e Dongi people who stayed on the \noutskirts of PTVI’s COW area is now no longer connected to PTVI’s power line.   \n\nIn relation to the above background, the following are  PTVI’s responses and current  position \nrelated to the points raised by the Environmental Justice: \n\n1.  PTVI is in good faith willing to settle the issue of  the Karonsi’e Dongi people. Our efforts \n\nshould be well coordinated with local government to optimize the outcomes. \n\n2.  PTVI is committed to improve certain facilities for the residential area in Ledu-Ledu village, \nWasuponda.  These  commitments  include  procurement  of  water  supply,  reparation  of \naccess road, renovation of churches and implementation of community development and \nempowerment programs where PTVI increases the amount of area to be developed by the \nlocal farmers. \n\n3.  With respect to the electricity supply to the Karonsi’e Dongi community in Sorowako, PTVI \naffirms  that  it  never  disconnected  the  electricity.  As  mentioned  in  the  background,  the \nconnection  that  was  made  improperly  by  the  community  caused  an  overload  to  PTVI’s \n“disconnecting  switch”  resulting  in  an  explosion,  connection  loss  and  certain  other \naccidents. \n\n4.  With respect to the community’s request to reconnect the electricity: \n\n(i)  The area where Karonsi’e Dongi people’s huts are located is not intended to be a residential area \nas determined in the decrees issued by the Regional Government in relation to the relocation of \nKaronsi’e Dongi people to Ledu-Ledu village. \n\n(ii)  It is  not  possible  for  PTVI  to  provide  electricity  supply  to  other  parties  as  PTVI  only  holds  an \n“Operation License” or “Izin Operasi” which only allows PTVI to generate electricity for its own \nuse. Therefore, by law, PTVI is not allowed to provide electricity to the public. \n\n(iii) In  principle,  it  is  the  obligation  of  local  government  through  PT  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara \n(Persero) (PLN) as the state-owned company that is in charge of electricity supply in Indonesia \nto supply electricity to the public, not PTVI.   \n\nPage 2 of 7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fNew Caledonia \n\nVale Nouvelle-Calédonie (VALE NC) clarifies that the acid leaks mentioned in the Environmental \nJustice Atlas occurred in 2009 and 2014; not in the years of 2010 and 2012. Furthermore, the \nimpacts to the local freshwater ecosystem caused by  both leaks were reversed. The VALE NC \nproject has performed a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (hereafter the “EIA”) \nas  required  by  international  regulation  and  submitted  it  to  third-party  reviews  (by  INERIS, \nCEREGE  and  ARMINES  –  for  more  information  please  see  annex  1).  All  major  impacts  were \nidentified and subject to  elimination/mitigation measures.  There were no impacts associated \nwith the presence of mercury in either the HPAL process or the coal-fired Power Plant (operated \nby the energy supplier ENERCAL both for the plant and for public distribution - annex 1). The EIA \nwas validated by all stakeholders, including NGOs and Rheebu Nuu.  \n\nRegarding  the  hiring  of  workers  for  the  construction  phase  of  the  project,  VALE  NC  hired  all \navailable  members  of  the  local  labor  force  before  importing  Filipino  workers  to  meet  the \nconstruction needs. Moreover, for several years, the NGO Rheebu Nuu has played a significant \nrole in managing and administering the Pact agreement signed between themselves, Vale NC, \nand the Customary Authority (hereafter the “PACT” in Annex 1). Today, Rheebu Nuu holds the \npresidency of the three structures that comprise the Pact. This represents an annual investment \nof more than US$ 3 million per year for VALE NC supporting environmental, social, and cultural \nprojects in the communities as well as the training of youth. \n\nVALE NC has also employed for years several  hundred-people  from the local communities. In \naddition, more than 10 companies were founded by the communities with the support of VALE \nNC to supply the mine and the plant. We have also established a permanent dialogue with the \ncommunities and the tribal authorities of New Caledonia. \n\nRegarding dams, VALE NC is indeed concerned with dam safety, and has been since well before \nthe dam breach in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil, which occurred on January 25, 2019.  Vale \nhas further heightened dam safety governance in all its operations, including New Caledonia. \n\nIn New Caledonia, a dam safety report is submitted to the French regulator and inspections are \nconducted under the governance of the High Dam Committee of the French state. Every year, \nan inspection is performed by French and local authorities (DIMENC). After the Brumadinho dam \nbreach, VALE NC launched an internal dam safety audit as a precautionary measure.  \n\nMore recently, VALE NC confirmed a US$ 600 million investment for the period 2019-2022 to \nfinance the Lucy project, which will replace wet residues with dry stacked residues using a filter \npress  technology.  VALE  NC  has  been  developing  this  technology  for  the  past  three  years.  It \npromises to ensure an additional 20 years of activity and allow VALE NC to safely declassify its \nexisting dam.  \n\nVALE NC has operated a pilot dewatering plant since December 2017, reinforcing the fact that \nthe  decision  to  change  the  technology  was  taken  before  the  Brumadinho  dam  breach.  This \ntechnology will allow VALE NC to declassify the Kwe dam. VALE NC also decided to finance an \nimportant program of maintenance to make its operation safe and preserve the integrity of the \nplant. Construction of a solar park (30 MW) to provide a sustainable electricity supply is expected \nin 2021. \n\nLocal communities are also involved in and benefitting from the Lucy project by being awarded \na significant part of the bid for earth works, road construction and more. \n\nPage 3 of 7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOnça Puma \n\nSince the start of the Carajás Project in the 1980s, Vale has maintained a long-term relationship \nwith  the  Xikrin  People,  including  the  transfer  of  funds  and  provision  of  complementary \nhealthcare.  \n\nVale´s Onça Puma mine, in Ourilândia do Norte (in the state of Pará, Brazil), is duly licensed by \nthe Secretariat of Environment and Sustainability of the state of Pará (Semas), meeting all the \nconditions  established  by  Brazil´s  Environmental  Agency  and  Brazil´s  National  Indigenous \nFoundation (Funai).  \n\nIn November 2005, Vale presented the final report of the Xikrin do Cateté ethnoecological study \nto Funai, foundation responsible for knowing, evaluating, and raising issues involving indigenous \npeoples. Funai delivered its evaluation on the report five years later. During this five-year period, \nVale moved ahead with the performance of some mitigation actions – such as water well drilling \nin the three villages, as a demonstration the company´s good faith, as well as its intention of \ncarrying out actions that benefited the Xikrin while the studies were being analyzed.  \n\nVale clarifies  that for years now, it has attempted to comply with the actions outlined in the \nEnvironmental  Basic  Plan  (PBA),  which  focuses  on  environmental  programs,  and  is  currently \nbeing  executed  up  until  the  area  border  of  the  Xikrin  indigenous  territory  of  Cateté.  This  is \nbecause the indigenous people continue to deny Vale access to their territory, despite the fact \nthat in 2015 the company managed to come to an agreement with the indigenous people and \nthe Federal Public Prosecutor (Ministério Público Federal – MPF) regarding entering the territory \nto perform the environmental control actions.  This agreement is officially documented in the \nmeeting  minutes,  duly  signed  by  the  parties  who  participated  in  the  meeting.    Vale  has  also \nproposed to the Federal Public Prosecutor (MPF) that it could hire a technician to accompany, \nalong with a representative of the Xikrin, the execution of the PBA, but the company has not \nreceived an answer from the MPF.  \n\nAs  noted  above,  Vale  has  faced  resistance  by  the  indigenous  peoples,  who  demand  financial \nresources instead of the execution of the environmental programs. Accessing the indigenous \nterritory is paramount to implement the actions determined by the PBA, already approved by \nFunai. Vale remains open to dialogue with the Xikrin people and reiterates that it will continue \nawaiting their authorization, respecting the indigenous peoples´ culture and rights. \n\nIt is important to note that Funai does not recommend the direct transfer of financial resources \nto  indigenous  peoples,  but  rather  supports  the  structuring  of  self-sustainable  projects. \nCorroborating this approach, since 2005, the MPF has acknowledged that the Xikrin are engaging \nin a rather consumerist lifestyle applying the financial resources received in actions that are not \nlinked to self-sustainable projects. \n\nRegarding the MPF Civil Action filed in 2012, it was prompted by the fact that Vale did not comply \nwith one of the conditionings (n.16) of the Prior Environmental License (LP). This conditioning \ndetermined the need for an action plan to mitigate the enterprise´s impacts on its neighboring \nindigenous territories, including the environmental and economic losses faced by the indigenous \npeoples in the case of the non-compliance of this condition. Since Vale did not implement the \nproposed actions in the Indigenous Component Study (ECI - Estudo do Componente Indígena) \nthe MPF determined the shutdown of Onça Puma or the payment of monthly funds until the \neffective compliance with the conditioning. \n\nPage 4 of 7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAs a result of the 2015 Onça Puma Public Civil Action  – on the grounds that Onça Puma was \ncontaminating the Cateté River – reports, from seven experts appointed by the Federal Judge of \nRedenção,  demonstrated  a  complete  lack  of  connection  between  Vale’s  activities  and  the \nalleged contamination of  the Cateté River.  The professionals who produced the reports were \nfrom several technical fields of expertise, namely metallurgical, civil, and forestry engineering, \nagronomy, geology, limnology/Biology (Ichthyofauna) and social assistance. Therefore, despite \nthe  allegation  of  environmental  impacts,  experts  concluded  that  there  is  no  causality  link \nbetween the activities developed by Vale’s enterprise and the supposed contamination of the \nwater course that separates the company and the indigenous land in question. On the contrary, \nthese reports highlighted the positive effects that the enterprise had brought to its surrounding \ncommunities, including the Xikrin. \n\nAs of June 2019, the mining and nickel processing have come to a halt as per the latest judicial \norder.  \n\nVale  currently  gives  approximately  R$  14  million  a  year  to  the  Xikrin  due  to  another  lawsuit \n(Ferro Carajás lawsuit), which is on-going. Up until the second quarter of 2019, the total amount \ntransferred to the indigenous population, to fulfill this action, is approximately R$ 120 million. \n\nAdditionally,  because  of  the  Onça  Puma  Public  Civil  Action,  almost  R$  85  million  have  been \ndeposited in judicial account since 2015. The application of these resources was defined in the \nConduct  Adjustment  Term  (TAC)  signed  between  the  Federal  Public  Prosecutor  and  the \nassociations that represent the Xikrin and the Kayapó. Some of this has already been accessed \nby the indigenous people, with approximately R$ 45 million by Xikrin and approximately R$ 19 \nmillion by Kayapó. It should be stressed that, since Vale is not a party to the Conduct Adjustment \nTerm, it is not able to know if the appeal is being executed and / or if the purpose of the term \nhas been fulfilled. \n\nMoreover, Vale has been depositing, monthly, in judicial account approximately R$ 2 million, \nand  a  court  order  has  suspended  the  indigenous  peoples  to  access  the  funds  due  to  several \ninconsistencies, among them the lack of accountability. There is also a judicial order requesting \nthat the Xikrin return R$ 10 million, erroneously raised by the Xikrin and their lawyer. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that, in relation to the Kayapó People, the Environmental Basic Plan (PBA) \nof the Indigenous Component at the Onça Puma operation is being fulfilled by the company, as \napproved by the licensing and indigenous parties. \n\nSocio-economic impacts of mining in Onça Puma  \n\nMore than 1,200 people are contracted directly in the region where Vale operates, with more \nthan  700  direct  and  550  permanent  contracted  employees.  This  employment  helps  the  local \neconomy. In 2018 alone, the company purchased goods amounting to R$ 300 million from local \nsuppliers in Ourilândia. \n\nThe Onça Puma shutdown also affects income sources and total salaries of approximately R$ \n100 million (reference 2018) that may stop circulating financially in the city and the surrounding \nregion. This amount includes salaries and benefits, such as food vouchers. \n\nIt  is  worth  noting  that  Vale,  through  its  Onça  Puma  operation,  generated  R$  180  million, \nbetween  2015  to  2018,  including,  among  others,  ISS  (Services  Tax)  and  CFEM  (Financial \nCompensation for the Exploration of Mineral Resources). In 2018, the ISS generated by Vale in \n\nPage 5 of 7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fthe city of Ourilândia do Norte, for example, was R$ 2.8 million and R$ 776 thousand for São \nFélix do Xingu, which also experiences the positive effects of Vale’s activity in the region. \n\nPage 6 of 7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAnnex 1  \n\nThe EIA of VALE NC was initiated in the early 1990s with a completed baseline environmental \nstudy  based  on  the  latest  international  methods  and  standards.  From  2002-2003,  technical \nexperts INERIS were entrusted to validate and/or improve technical options proposed by VALE \nNC.  In  2006,  the  New  Caledonia  South  Province  authority  mandated  CEREGE  to  review  the \nmarine outfall system before its eventual validation. Similarly, in 2007, the French Ministry of \nEnvironment appointed Armines to conduct a technical review of tailings management.    \n\nThe hydrometallurgical process at VALE NC uses water from Yate Lake. Most of the water is used \nin a closed circuit for the process. One part is discharged at sea, after treatment through a 24-\nkm submarine pipe equipped with a diffuser. Before release, the treated effluent is controlled \nand monitored continuously by VALE NC and other institutions and NGOs to ensure compliance \nwith legal norms. \n\nPRONY Energy  (PE),  a subsidiary of ENERCAL owns and operates a 100 MW coal fired power \nplant. PE provides 50 MW of energy to the VALE NC plant and 50 MW to the NC domestic market. \nAs  owner,  PE  takes  full  responsibility  for  monitoring  and  reporting  on  its  environmental \nperformance, notably gaseous emissions, to proper authorities in conformance with applicable \nregulations.  \n\nWith the signature of the PACT agreement in 2008, VALE NC invests about US$ 3 million per year \nover a 30-year period to fund local initiatives to develop jobs and promote activities in the tribes \nof the Djubea Kaponé tribal area. This includes facilitating and implementing a high standard of \nenvironmental control by the communities.  VALE NC has established a permanent dialogue with \nRheebu Nuu and other NGOs. In fact, Rheebu Nuu currently occupies the presidency of the PACT \ninstitutions.  \n\nFor years VALE NC has employed several hundred-local people and supported tribal companies \ncreated by the Kanak people in the south of New Caledonia. Moreover, a permanent dialogue \nhas also been established with the tribal authorities. \n\nPage 7 of 7"}

Inditex works with suppliers across 43 different countries to source most of its \nproducts –57% of the factories are close to headquarters in Arteixo (A Coruña, Spain), \nmainly in Spain, Portugal, Turkey and Morocco. Same principles are followed irrespective of \nthe sourcing market: always source responsibly and sustainably. In this sense, despite  the \nrelatively small sourcing we do from Myanmar, same standards and principles are \nmaintained. \n\nMyanmar Knitting Factory produces for one of our brands through a direct \nsupplier. Our presence in the factory amounts to roughly 10% of the factory’s capacity. \nBefore the factory was approved to carry out any production for us, Myanmar Knitting was \npreviously assessed to ensure that all labour and human rights were respected in the \nfactory. In this sense, after this pre-assessment and until date, Inditex has performed four \nsocial audits in the factory showing compliance with our Code of Conduct. Each audit \nproduces a corrective action plan for the continuous improvement of the factory conditions, \nwhich are followed up by Inditex’s social sustainability teams. Direct supplier is \nalways involved in these processes and takes responsibility for the welfare of the \nworkers in the factory. \n\nAs soon as we received information about a worker strike in the factory we immediately \ncontacted the supplier in order to receive more information about the case and to monitor \nthat workers’ rights were being respected. This process resulted in the signature of a \ncollective bargaining agreement negotiated by factory and workers which consequence was \nthe restating of the factory operation as a result of this agreement. \n\nInditex fully respects the right of freedom of association as a fundamental and enabling right \nfor all workers.  This respect is one of pillars of our supply chain responsible strategy and it \nis cascaded down to all suppliers and factories that are involved in our productions \naccording the Inditex Code of Conduct for Manufacturers and Suppliers. \n\nAs part of the Global Framework Agreement signed between Inditex and IndustriALL Global \nUnion in 2007, Inditex, through its Sustainability Department and its local \nteams in production countries, maintains a close and regular collaboration with IndustriALL \nGlobal Union and its local representatives along with the National and local trade Unions. \nThis approach is followed to enforce the rights of Freedom of Association and Collective \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\fbargaining but also to promote social dialogue as the only way to handle any  potential \ndispute that may appear in our supply chain related with the principles of our Global \nFramework Agreement. \n\nSpecifically in Myanmar, Inditex started a collaboration with the International Labor \nOrganization in the country through the participation in their project ILO-GIP which also \nworks at factory and sectorial level in the promotion of social dialogue and the achievement \nof mature industrial relations in the garment sector. \n\nConnected with the previous lines of work, we would like to remark the creation of a national \nplatform of dialogue -Myanmar Buyers Forum- that contributes to the promotion of social \ndialogue in the Myanmar Industry which was created with the leadership of the organization \nSMART Myanmar (Project funded by the European Union with the objective of actively \npromoting and supporting the sustainable production of garments \n“Made in Myanmar”) . Inditex representatives joined the last edition of this platform, as we \nconsider that this national initiative with participation of brands, employers and Unions \nconstitutes a clear example of promotion of industrial relations at sectorial level in Myanmar. \n\nInditex would like to reaffirm its commitment with labor rights and in consequence with the \nensuring of the rights of Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining in our supply \nchain. As part of this commitment and the above lines of work, Inditex is actively \nworking in the promotion of Living Wages though ACT initiative along with 20 \nmore International Brands and IndustriALL Global Union. In this sense, and as one of its \nmain objectives, ACT collaborates with employers, trade unions and \ngovernments in garment producing countries to support collective bargaining at industry \nlevel. Myanmar is also a country  the scope of ACT initiative, under which a the Freedom of \nAssociation Guideline is being promoted through the dialogue of  ACT Brand suppliers \nand IndustriALL Global Union through its affiliate in the country. We believe that this is \nanother way to empower local actors in their commitment to improve labor conditions in the \ncountry through a sustainable view of industrial relations."}

Countryman\n\nSecretary, Securities and Exchange Commission\n100 F Street NE\n\nWashington, DC 20549-1090\n\nWashington, February 10, 2020\n\nSubject: Proposed rule, Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, Release No. 34-87783;\nFile No. S7-24-19. TOTAL’s position.\n\nTOTAL is and acts in favor of financial transparency. To illustrate this commitment, TOTAL joined the\nExtractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) from its inception, as it believes that this voluntary and\nmulti-stakeholder initiative is key to promote transparency and provide stakeholders with a common set\nof principles that will protect them against inconsistencies between national regulations.\n\nIn 2013, the European Union issued a directive (Directive 2013/34/EU) requiring European companies\nactive in the extractive industries to publish an annual report on payments made to government of\nproducing countries. TOTAL has published since 2016 an annual report on payments for fiscal year 2015\nin compliance with French regulations implementing Directive 2013/34/EU. Similar reporting obligations\ncurrently exist in Canada and Norway.\n\nTOTAL considers that the re-introduction of Rule 13q-1 under the Dodd Frank Act should enhance\ntransparency for the benefit of the whole industry and its stakeholders and, to this end, restore a level\nplaying field among major publicly listed oil and gas companies. TOTAL believes that the alignment of the\nProposed rule with Directive 2013/34/EU is key in improving the quality and comparability of information\nbetween issuers complying with different reporting regimes.\n\nTOTAL recognizes that the SEC positively answers its concerns by proposing to adopt an approach similar\nto the European transparency legislation. However, TOTAL identifies substantial differences between the\nProposed rule and Directive 2013/34/EU and notes that the Proposed rule is less stringent than the EU\nregime mainly on two key points: (i) the threshold above which payment to foreign governments must be\npresented in the report and (ii) the definition of the term “project”.\n\nThese distinctions may (i) result in a competitive disadvantage detrimental to EU issuers, (ii) weaken oil &\ngas issuers’ position towards the governments, requiring additional information and/or different\ninformation to be disclosed on a same project depending of their jurisdictions and (iii) increase the\nmateriality of the risk of misunderstandings from the issuers’ stakeholders.\n\nOther differences, although less significant, could also be reconciled in relation to the reporting perimeter\n(affiliates in the full and proportionate consolidation perimeters under the EU regime) and to the\ngovernance of the disclosure (approval by the board of directors under the EU regime).\n\n1627 | Street, NW, Suite 910, Washington D.C. 20006\n+1 202 464 7075\n\n\nFurthermore, as the EU reporting requirements satisfy the transparency objectives of Section 13(q),\nTOTAL considers foreign issuers already reporting payments to governments in compliance with the EU\nreporting regime, should be automatically exempted from filing an additional reporting under the SEC\nProposed rule.\n\nTOTAL considers that (i) the equivalency recognition of EU reporting regime should be automatic and not\ndiscretionary (as it is in Canada pursuant to the Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA)),\nand (ii) that the determination of this equivalency recognition should be made by the SEC immediately\nthereafter adopting the proposed rules in final form. Such automatic equivalency recognition will secure\nforeign private issuers and limit their administrative burden and compliance costs.\n\nAs a result, Total strongly supports that the SEC (i) align the Proposed rule with Directive 2013/34/EU for\nthe purpose of the substantial differences stated above, (ii) assesses and confirms that the disclosure\nrequirements adopted by the European Union in Directive 2013/34/EU’s satisfy Section 13(q)’s\ntransparency objectives and (iii) unilaterally makes a determination of the automatic equivalency\nrecognition of the reporting provided by foreign issuers under the EU reporting regime.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nFrancois Badoual\nPresident & CEO, TOTAL Washington D.C.

Since 2013, \nRio Tinto has provided on-going updates in relation to the Juukan area, principally at scheduled bi-annual Local \nImplementation Committee meetings as required by the Participation Agreement as well as other regular forums. \nThese meetings include PKKP Traditional Owners and their representatives, as well as Rio Tinto.    \n\nThe mining activity conducted in May 2020 was undertaken in accordance with all necessary approvals. It was \npreceded by a ministerial consent under Section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) (AHA). This was \nobtained  in  2013  after  detailed  consultation  with  the  PKKP  people  over  a  decade  that  included  research \ninvestigations  in  2008  under  a  Section  16  authorisation  under  the  AHA.  Following  the  Section  18  consent, \nextensive  heritage  preservation  and  salvage  work  was  undertaken  in  2014  -  all  with  the  PKKP  people’s \ninvolvement.   \n\nFrom 2014, the PKKP people and Rio Tinto continued dialogue on the Juukan area, including discussion on the \nfindings from the specialist studies that were conducted on the excavated materials. With the approval of the PKKP \npeople, the preserved artefacts have been deposited at a Rio Tinto storage facility to ensure appropriate protection \nof the material and we are working with the PKKP people on longer-term options.  \n\nWe have continued to work closely and collaboratively with the PKKP people on a range of heritage matters and \nhave modified our operations to minimise cultural and heritage impacts.   \n\nWe proceeded with our operations at Brockman 4 in reliance on our comprehensive agreement with the PKKP \npeople and having all necessary approvals and consents. We are very sorry for the distress we have caused. \n\nWe will continue to work with the PKKP people to learn from what has taken place and strengthen our partnership. \nAs a matter of urgency, we are reviewing the plans of all other sites in the Juukan Gorge area. \n\nIn relation to our heritage approach more broadly, to support thorough engagement on these issues, we have a \nrange of formal processes in place, which go beyond legal requirements. These activities support ongoing dialogue \nand engagement to occur as part of these processes on cultural heritage. Our framework for agreement making \nwith Traditional Owners includes working with  host communities throughout  the life of an  agreement to ensure \nTraditional Owners receive fair compensation and a share of benefits in exchange for secure access to land.  \n\nWe are conducting a comprehensive review of our heritage processes and how they are applied in our Iron Ore \nbusiness, with Rio Tinto board and Indigenous leader oversight, to help identify, understand and recommend \nways to improve the effectiveness of our processes. We will engage with the PKKP people and other Traditional \nOwner groups as appropriate, through the review process.  \n\nOur application of appropriate legislation will be examined as part of this review and we will provide input into \nany Western Australian government reform of the AHA.    \n\nWe continue to work closely with Traditional Owners across Australia, and our commitment remains as strong as \never.  \n\nPage 1 of 1"}

One of the most important actions is \nto strictly follow the WHO protocol - conducting mass testing, which allows to quickly identify \npeople who have had contact with the virus and are asymptomatic. \n\nThe mapping of these people through testing, such as screening, allows one to adopt measures \nsuch as social distancing and immediate medical attention. By following the WHO protocol and \ntaking the correct measures, Vale contributes to the control of COVID-19 in the cities where it \noperates. \n\nMass testing provides transparency as to the number of people who have had contact with the \nvirus and helps companies and public authorities to define the most effective actions against the \npandemic and care for the people who were infected by the virus. Therefore, Vale understands \nthat the more accurate the data collected, the better grounded these actions will be to preserve \nlives. \n\nThe tests  carried out by Vale, in Itabira, Brazil,  as well as in  other locations,  began and were \ncompleted  according  to  the  program  established  by  Vale.  The  statistical  analysis  of  health \nsurveillance  is  being  carried  out  after  the  completion  of  the  testing  cycle  as  directed  by  the \ncompetent bodies. \n\nVale  operates  in  an  activity  considered  essential  and  will  continue  to  do  mass  testing  of  its \nemployees, being consistent with its policy of preventing and fighting the coronavirus, which \nstarted with the donation of 5 million tests to the Brazilian Government. The company believes \nthat knowledge and information sharing with the competent bodies are fundamental to beating \nCovid-19  and  will  remain  with  the  firm  purpose  of  supporting  the  municipalities  where  it \noperates in the testing process, as is the case in Itabira. \n\nPrevention \n\nIn its operations, Vale works with a minimum number of employees and collaborators in order \nto safely maintain only essential activities. In addition to adopting 'home office' early on, since \nMarch 16, the company has put in place a series of actions to protect the health and safety of \nits employees and contractors, such as keeping workers 60 years and over or with risk factors at \nhome, scheduling shifts and constant disinfection of the environments, the mandatory use of \nmasks  in  the  units,  daily  screening  on  the  arrival  of  workers,  with  body  temperature \nmeasurement and health questionnaire for 100% of the staff, use of technology to track where \nemployees went through, in addition to other measures of social distancing, such as increasing \nthe bus fleet to reduce occupancy and greater distance in restaurants.  \n\nMore information on Vale's actions in Itabira, MG, and elsewhere, related to the fight against \nCOVID-19 can be found on VALE´s website:  \n(http://www.vale.com/brasil/PT/aboutvale/news/Paginas/vale-apoia-itabira-no-combate-ao-\ncoronavirus-desde-o-inicio-da-pandemia.aspx and \nhttp://www.vale.com/brasil/EN/people/coronavirus/Pages/default.aspx) \n\nPage 1 of 1"}

Total does not have any further information on how the \nCoalition is using the requisitioned area. \n\nIn accordance with the French law on the corporate duty of vigilance, the Vigilance Plan \nof Total sets out the reasonable measures of vigilance put in place to identify risks and \nprevent severe impacts on, notably, human right and fundamental freedoms resulting \nfrom the activities of Total SA and the companies it controls directly or indirectly, as well \nas the activities of certain suppliers or subcontractors of suppliers. As Yemen LNG is not \ncontrolled by Total, it falls outside the scope of the Vigilance Plan by virtue of the law \nitself.  \n\nNevertheless, Total chose to include information on Yemen LNG in the Declaration of \nExtra-Financial Performance of its 2019 Universal Registration Document \n(https://www.total.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq111/files/atoms/files/2019_total_universal_r\negistration_document.pdf, P.238).Total is mindful of the principles of both the OECD \nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United Nation Guiding Principles on \nBusiness and Human Rights. \n\nSince 2015, neither Yemen LNG nor Total have received any profit, compensation or \nadvantage of any kind related to this situation. In fact, since 2015, Total and the other \nforeign shareholders have continued to finance Yemen LNG at a loss, to preserve the site \nand continue supplying power and water to local communities. The Balhaf plant has \ntherefore remained in good condition. Total’s actions since 2015 as a Yemen LNG \nshareholder have been solely intended to (i) ensure the safety of local employees, and \n(ii) preserve the Balhaf site so that it can resume LNG production once peace has been \nrestored in Yemen."}

In said resolutions, \nthe  referred  authority  established  that  said  industry  could  restart  operations \nwhenever the relevant companies could prove that they had submitted the statement \nof fulfilment of the sanitary protocols established by the authorities.

The guidance calls for clear communications, the proper \nnotification and calculation of severance pay (and other benefits) and ensuring an effective \nmeans to resolve any dispute. \n\nSCI is one of the largest apparel manufacturers in Cebu. It employs over 18,000 workers and \nproduces for multiple international brands, including adidas. In advance of any announced \nretrenchment, SCI shared with its workers its ongoing business challenges and the options it \nwas considering in the face of Covid-19. SCI’s retrenchment plan, which includes clear selection \ncriteria and a detailed severance package, was presented to the Department of Labor and \nEmployment (DOLE) for its review and approval, prior to being communicated to the workforce.  \nTo date, 97% of the 4,400 impacted workers have signed their termination agreement and \nreceived their lawful severance, including one month pay in lieu of notice and additional in-kind \nassistance from SCI. \n\nBeginning in June 2020, YTI, which is a smaller manufacturer in the Mactan economic zone, \nretrenched approximately 700 workers. We can confirm that employees have received their \nlawful severance and payment in lieu of notice, as per YTI’s legal obligations.   \n\nBoth YTI and SCI have committed to maintain an open dialogue with the affected workers and \naddress any grievance in a fair and timely manner. To this end, YTI is in an active mediation with \na group of retrenched workers regarding their overall severance package. Although YTI is not \nunionized, a representation from one of the Philippine’s largest trade unions (ALU) has been \npermitted to observe the mediation, which is being managed by the DOLE in Cebu. \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWe continue to be closely engaged with our suppliers and are receiving regular updates on the \nDOLE-managed mediation. We have also called on our suppliers to assist the affected workers \nsecure unemployment benefit from the Philippines’ Social Security System, which they have \nagreed to do. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President, Global Social & Environmental Affairs  \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

We are working hard to address \nthem. We recognize the important role that human rights defenders, play in the promotion \nand protection of human rights worldwide. We do not tolerate threats, intimidation or physical \nattacks against human rights defenders in relation to our operations. We expect our \nsuppliers to follow the same approach. \n\nFor a number of years, we have been working with partners, including the Danish Institute \nfor Human Rights, Earthworm Foundation, and Verité, to improve transparency, traceability \nand supplier practices in the palm oil industry. Our approach is to work together with our \nsuppliers to identify and address specific labor or human rights issues. If our suppliers refuse \nto make improvements, we will end our relationship with them. \n\nIn Peru, we’ve been engaging our palm oil suppliers for a number of years on forest \nprotection, human rights and on company-community relations with the support of our \npartner, Earthworm Foundation. We are well aware of the complex local context and are \ncommitted to contributing to making a positive impact on the ground. \n\nWe source directly from Alpamayo, a refinery that buys 100 percent of its volumes from the \nOlpesa mill. We are aware of the allegations that Olpesa sources from the plantation Ocho \nSur, which has been accused of human rights violations. \n\nAs part of our Responsible Sourcing program, we aim to achieve full traceability to plantation \nfor all the palm oil that we source to ensure that it is produced responsibly. This work is \nbased on a traceability self-declaration exercise carried out by all our direct suppliers on \nannual basis. According to this, Olpesa and Alpamayo do not source from Ocho Sur. \nHowever, we take the claims against Ocho Sur very seriously and, in 2019, we engaged our \npartner, Earthworm Foundation, to carry out an investigation on the ground to verify these \nclaims. The investigation included reaching out to civil society organizations. The results \nwere inconclusive as Earthworm Foundation was not able to find evidence linking Ocho Sur \nto Alpamayo and Olpesa. We have therefore commissioned a robust, independent audit of \nAlpamaya’s and Olpesa’s traceability systems. This audit was planned for the second \nquarter of this year. This had to be rescheduled due to the Covid-19 mobility restrictions and \nwill take place as soon as the situation permits it. The findings will allow us to have a better \nunderstanding of the reliability of the company’s traceability systems and confirm the origin \nof the fresh fruit bunch. If any shortcomings in the traceability systems are found, a \ncorrective action plan will be implemented together with Aplamyao and Olpesa.  \n\nMore broadly, we work with Earthworm Foundation to carry out assessments against our \nResponsible Sourcing Standard in our palm oil supply chain at the refinery, mill and \nplantation levels. Based on these, we develop together time-bound action plans, in which \nsuppliers disclose and report progress on closing gaps identified. Where issues have been \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n\fidentified at a specific mill or plantation, our supplier may also develop a more specific action \nplan to help track progress on addressing these issues. If suppliers refuse to cooperate, we \ndelist them from our supply chain. We have an action plan with Alpamayo and are currently \nreviewing it with them to strengthen it.  \n\nFinally, we’re also supporting a landscape project in Tocache, in which Alpamayo is \ninvolved. Currently this project focuses on forest protection but is transitioning into a more \nholistic approach. As of 2021, it will also address labor rights as well as community rights.”"}

Antapaccay registered these protocols with the Ministry of \nHealth, in line with current regulations, and they are under continuous evaluation and \nimprovement. \n\n• \n\n• \n\nSince the beginning of the State of Emergency in Peru, Antapaccay has supported the \nEspinar communities by providing 15,750 food packs to vulnerable populations \n(identified by communities’ leaders).  \n\nIt has provided medical equipment to Espinar and Cusco´s medical facilities. Recently, in \nresponse to the lack of medical oxygen in Espinar, the company donated 60 medical \noxygen balloons and contracted the construction of a medical oxygen facility for \ndonation to Espinar’s hospital. \n\nAntapaccay has observed with concern the unrest and protests in the Espinar region from 20 \nJuly to 7 August. The protests and demonstrations pose risks to public health in the context \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. The unrest is also causing widespread disruption, including the \nburning of trucks belonging to Las Bambas (a non-Glencore operated mine), road blockades \nand the burning of pasture land.  \n\nThe protests also impacted Antapaccay directly, resulting in the interruption of the change-\nout of the workers at site which unfortunately meant the workers had to stay at the camp \nfor a longer period than scheduled (with full compensation). The protestors destroyed a \nwater pump inside the mine’s property, which interrupted the supply of water for \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

The \nroad blockades blocked deliveries of food to Antapaccay’s workers.  \n\nAntapaccay supports the peaceful resolution of the protests. It has sought to maintain \ntransparent communication with its stakeholders throughout the period of unrest.  \n\nIn response to allegations and points made by the reports, we have provided detailed \nresponses below: \n\nSolidarity bonds  \nOn 7 August, senior representatives of Peru’s national government, together with \nrepresentatives of provincial and district authorities and representatives of the civil society \nof Espinar, agreed to an extraordinary social assistance programme to support the residents \nof the Espinar region in a time of a national health crisis. This social assistance comes as a \npre-paid card voucher for 1000 Soles, for use for food and medical needs, school tuition, \nutilities (water, electricity) and phone and internet services.  \n\nThe extraordinary social assistance programme is funded by the Framework Agreement \n(”Convenio Marco por el Desarrollo de la Provincia de Espinar”), representing up to 3% of \nAntapaccay’s annual income before tax. The Framework Agreement’s Management \nCommittee, consisting of the Mayor of the Province of Espinar, six representatives of local \ncommunities and civil society and one representative of Antapaccay, oversaw the \nprogramme. Each member of the Management Committee has one vote, including \nAntapaccay. It is the responsibility of the Management Committee as a whole to progress \nthe distribution of the programme; Antapaccay is not in a position to issue the vouchers by \nitself or to direct the decisions of the Management Committee outside its one vote.  \n\nTo support and expedite the initiative, during meetings held on 11 and 13 August \nAntapaccay proposed three options for the distribution of vouchers to the Management \nCommittee. The Management Committee rejected all of these proposals and agreed to \nappoint Banco de la Nacion (a state-owned bank) to implement the programme. On 19 \nAugust, the Mayor of the Province of Espinar sent a letter to the bank, instructing it to \nundertake the programme. Banco de la Nacion chose not to participate in the process. \n\nFollowing Banco de la Nacion’s decision, the Management Committee approved to work \nwith EDENRED PERU S.A. (EDENRED) to carry out this initiative. The Management Committee \nsigned a contract with EDENRED on 15 September and then transferred funds from the \nFramework Agreement. The Management Committee is finalising the signing of a contract \nwith the entity selected to distribute these funds in Espinar. \n\nGovernance of the Framework Agreement  \nThe Management Committee oversees the use of the funds collected under the Framework \nAgreement; Antapaccay has no authority. Since its inception, Antapaccay has contributed \nover US$133 million to the Framework Agreement, which has provide funding for over 1,000 \nprojects, benefiting 76 communities throughout the province of Espinar.  \n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Energy and Mines commenced a review of the Framework \nAgreement. Antapaccay continues to support and participate in this process. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fUpholding respect for human rights \nGlencore and Antapaccay seek to uphold respect for human rights throughout our activities. \nAntapaccay is committed to upholding its human rights policy and the requirements of the \nVoluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Antapaccay does not have contracts with \npublic security forces.  \n\nSince 16 March, Peru is operating under a state of national emergency due to the COVID-19 \ncrisis. This has led to the restriction of certain constitutional rights for all citizens by the \nPeruvian Government, including the freedom of assembly and transit. In this challenging and \nunprecedented context, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence decided to \nincrease the presence of public security in Espinar, following road blockades, burning of \ntrucks and pastures, and other violent acts. Antapaccay did not request the presence of \npublic security in the area. \n\nAntapaccay condemns any acts of violence. To date, Antapaccay has not received complaints \nfrom members of the surrounding communities regarding the conduct of public security \nforces during their deployment to the region during the COVID-19 crisis. Antapaccay does \nnot have the authority to investigate activities of public security forces. In case Antapaccay \nreceives any concerns from members of the community, it will pass them on to the relevant \ngovernment authorities. \n\nEnvironmental monitoring \nAntapaccay has implemented measures to monitor its environmental impacts, and to share \nthis information with its stakeholders. \n\nFollowing the completion of the Espinar roundtable dialogue led by the Minister of \nEnvironment in 2012-2013, the mine and the government conducted a number of studies to \nassess the presence of heavy metals in the region. The studies were conducted by regulatory \nauthorities such as ANA (national water authority - Ministry of Agriculture), OEFA (entity in \ncharge of the compliance with environmental obligations - Ministry of Environment) and \nINGEMMET (entity in charge of geoscientific information and that related to basic geology, \nunderground resources, geological and environment hazards - Ministry of Energy and \nMines). The studies concluded that the presence of heavy metals in the area is due to the \nnatural mineralisation and geochemical characteristics of the area. \n\nIn accordance with Peruvian regulation, the ANA and the OEFA regularly audit mine \nactivities. In addition, and following the recommendations of the roundtable dialogue in \n2012-2013, ANA has implemented regular participative monitoring with representatives of \nthe Espinar communities. The last instance of participative monitoring occurred in December \n2019, and will resume with the lifting of COVID-19-related restrictions. \n\nDevelopment of the Corrocohuayco project \nIn accordance Peruvian environmental and social regulations for mining activities, its \ncommitment to constructive dialogue with its stakeholders and the UN Guiding Principles for \nBusiness and Human Rights, Antapaccay has carried out public consultations in communities \nsurrounding the Corrocohuayco project as part of its environmental impact assessment.  \n\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mines, with support from Antapaccay, are carrying out targeted \nconsultations of indigenous peoples in accordance with Peruvian legislation.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFollowing an internal review of the project, Antapaccay has postponed the start of the \nconstruction of the project, with the new date currently under consideration. It has \ncommunicated this decision to the Peruvian government. \n\nAdditional contributions to the local economy \nIn addition to the Framework Agreement, Antapaccay contributes to the development of the \nEspinar province through the following channels: \n• \n\nRoyalties and taxes: 50% of its income tax, or $680 million over the last ten years, \nreverting to regional and provincial authorities for economic development \nExtensive contracts with local suppliers (goods and services): in 2020, Antapaccay will \ncontract more than $62 million with local suppliers, a 15% increase on that awarded \nduring 2019. \nThe ‘works-for-taxes’ mechanism (Obras por impuestos): Antapaccay is financing a \nwater and sewage project in Yauri, which will benefit 57,000 residents, and the \nconstruction of the Jatarana-San Martin dam, which will benefit more than 1,200 \nfamilies in ten communities. \n\n• \n\n• \n\nAs always, we appreciate the opportunity to provide further information on our assets and \ntheir contribution towards furthering local and regional socio-economic development.  \n\nKind regards, \n\nAnna Krutikov \nGroup Head of Sustainable Development"}

Lesdites  études  ont  débouché  sur \ndes plans d’action qui visent à renforcer les mesures en faveur \ndu  respect  des  droits  des  travailleurs  et  des  communautés \nlocales.\n\nDepuis  2010,  nous  disposons  d’un  mécanisme  de  réclamation  (« \nBureau des plaintes ») consacré au traitement des plaintes liées aux \nimpacts potentiellement causés par nos activités. Ce mécanisme a \nété conçu dans le cadre du programme des Nations unies pour le \ndéveloppement et ses performances sont régulièrement évaluées \npar des tiers.\n\nNous  pratiquons  une  politique  active  de  la  porte  ouverte,  qui \ncomprend  un  dialogue  transparent  et  constructif  avec  près  de \n400 communautés, des institutions et organisations locales, ainsi \nqu’avec des parties prenantes au niveaux national et international. \nNous engageons et consultons en permanence nos communautés \nd’accueil,  y  compris  les  populations  indigènes.  De  surcroît,  nous \navons accueilli plus de 8 000 visiteurs en 2019, parmi lesquels des \njournalistes, des représentants d’ONG de premier plan ainsi que des \ntouristes.\n\nAcquisition de terrains et relogements\n\nDepuis  le  début  de  l’exploitation  minière,  Cerrejón  a  acheté \ndes terres à la suite de négociations menées de bonne foi avec \nplus  de  960  familles  de  communautés  différentes.  Les  familles \n\n\fétaient  indemnisées  conformément  à  la  législation  locale  en \nvigueur  à  l’époque,  mais  Cerrejón  proposait  généralement  des \nprix supérieurs à ceux du marché.\n\nAprès la publication des lignes directrices de la Société financière \ninternationale  (SFI),  Cerrejón  les  a  adoptées  et  a  adapté  ses \nnormes en fonction, pour mieux gérer les processus d’acquisition \nde terres et les relogements des communautés.\n\nPour Cerrejón, le relogement est toujours une mesure de dernier \nrecours.  Si  une  réinstallation  s’avère  inévitable,  elle  s’effectue \nconformément  aux  directives  de  la  SFI,  tout  comme  cela  a \nété  le  cas  pour  les  cinq  communautés  qui  ont  dû  être  relogées \ndepuis  2006  :  Patilla,  Chancleta,  Las  Casitas,  Tamaquito  II  et \nRoche. Les 190 familles de ces communautés (soit environ 1 000 \npersonnes au total) ont été dûment indemnisées : elles vivent à \nde  nouveaux  emplacement  et  sont  désormais  propriétaires  de \nleurs maisons, ont accès à des infrastructures essentielles telles \nque  l’eau  potable,  l’énergie,  des  services  d’aqueduc  et  d’égout \n(accès qui n’était pas garanti auparavant). En outre, ils disposent \nde terres pour développer le travail agricole, reçoivent un soutien \ntechnique pour ce faire, et ont accès à des programmes éducatifs \net psychosociaux destinés à intégrer la durabilité au mode de vie \ndes personnes âgées.\n\nProgramme d’aide à l’éducation de Cerrejón\n\nYoe  Arregocés,  le  chef  de  la  communauté  de  Roche  qui \na  été  réinstallée,  est  devenu  le  premier  bénéficiaire  du \nprogramme d’aide à l’éducation de Cerrejón à obtenir un \nmaster en système de gestion intégré : \n\n« On voit que l’effort et l’accord auquel sont \nparvenus  la  communauté  de  Roche  et \nCerrejón dans le cadre de notre transfert \ndepuis notre lieu d’origine vers un nouveau site ont porté \nleurs fruits. Bien entendu, notre plus grand souhait est que \nnos enfants et nous-mêmes puissions continuer d’y avoir \naccès. Aujourd’hui, mon fils aîné est en huitième semestre \nde carrière professionnelle – grâce à cet accord éducatif. »                          \n\nYoe Arregocés\n\nCerrejón  dispose  d’un  plan  de \ngestion  environnementale,  qui  vise \nà  éviter  les  impacts  négatifs  sur \nl’environnement,  les  employés  et  les \ncommunautés. Le plan est conforme \nlégislation  colombienne  et  \nà \naux  normes \ninternationales  de \ngestion environnementale (ISO14001). \nIl  est  également  conforme  aux  \npermis  environnementaux  délivrés  par \nl’autorité  nationale \nchargée  des  permis  environnementaux  (ANLA),  qui  contrôle \nnos  performances  aux  côtés  de  Corpoguajira, \nl’autorité \nenvironnementale de la région.\n\nEnvironnement\n\nla \n\nAu  fil  des  ans,  nous  avons  mis  en  œuvre  diverses  mesures \ndestinées  à  garantir  que  notre  activité  n’a  pas  d’impact  négatif \nsur la qualité de l’eau et de l’air. Nous recherchons régulièrement \ndes moyens pour nous améliorer encore davantage, par exemple \nen  incorporant  de  nouvelles  technologies  nous  permettant \nd’améliorer nos systèmes de gestion. Le système de surveillance \nen  temps  réel,  l’activation  de  mesures  supplémentaires  si \nnécessaire, le système de surveillance de l’air et de l’eau n’en sont \nque quelques exemples.\n\nDepuis  2008,  Cerrejón  fait  partie  d’un  comité  de  surveillance \nenvironnementale  pour  l’exploitation  minière,  qui  est  composé \nde  17  représentants  de  la  communauté,  de  Corpoguajira  et  de \nl’université  de  La  Guajira.  Nous  sommes  convaincus  que  cet \nengagement collaboratif se traduira par des procédures optimisées \net un meilleur bien-être pour les communautés. \n\nInvestissement social\n\nEn 2019, la société a investi USD 3,8 millions en vue de renforcer \nles capacités dans la région, l’accès à l’eau et pour mettre en œuvre \ndes  projets  stratégiques.  Rien  qu’en  2019,  nos  programmes  de \nresponsabilité sociale ont permis de fournir 26,4 millions de litres \nd’eau  aux  communautés  avoisinant  nos  opérations.  Au  total,  164 \nmilliards de litres d’eau ont été fournis depuis qu’une sècheresse a \nété décrétée en 2014, et nous avons fourni un soutien éducatif à plus \nde 17 000 personnes. Par le biais de l’Initiative fiscale pour les travaux \npublics, Cerrejón a réalisé l’extension de la station d’épuration de \nRiohacha moyennant un investissement d’environ USD 2 millions. \n\nMesures clés pour contrôler les émissions de poussières\n\nSurveillance en temps réel grâce à un réseau de 16 stations  \n(11 à la mine, 2 sur la voie ferrée et 3 au port)\nArrosage des routes avec de l'eau industrielle non adaptée à la consommation humaine, \nanimale ou à l'usage agricole\nUtilisation de canons à fumée en vue d’une réduction des particules de poussière\n\nEfforts de nettoyage tout au long de l'année\n\nCompression du charbon dans les wagons de transport\n\nUtilisation de tapis roulants couverts à la mine et au port\n\nChargement direct du charbon au port\nLimitation ou cessation des opérations sur des sites spécifiques en fonction des conditions \nmétéorologiques\n\nUtilisation de l’eau : chiffres clés (2019)\n\n89% de l’eau utilisée par Cerrejón n’est pas adaptée à la consommation humaine ou \nanimale. Cerrejón utilise cette eau pour contrôler les émissions de poussières.\n\nSeulement 11 % de l’eau utilisée par Cerrejón est de qualité supérieure. Celle-ci est \nprincipalement utilisée pour nos employé(e)s et pour approvisionner les communautés \nen eau douce.\n\nRéduction de 70 % de la consommation d'eau de qualité supérieure depuis 2010.\n\nSeulement 1,8 % de l'eau provenant de la rivière Ranchería est utilisée par Cerrejón, \nprincipalement pour la consommation humaine.\n\nPlus de 4 000 échantillons d'eau sont prélevés chaque année dans 29 stations de \nsurveillance placés sur la rivière Ranchería et ses affluents, pour en contrôler la qualité.\n\nUn système de surveillance de l'eau en temps réel est en place pour alerter \ninstantanément sur les changements de qualité de l'eau.\n\nCerrejón ne rejette aucun déchet ni métal lourd dans la rivière Ranchería ou dans toute \nautre étendue d'eau.\n\nLes résultats sur la qualité de l’eau en aval des opérations minières démontrent que \nles activités de Cerrejón n’ont pas d’impact négatif sur la qualité de l’eau de la rivière \nRanchería, et qu’elles n’endommagent pas la flore et la faune aquatiques.\n\nEn  2020,  pour  faire  face  à  la  crise  humanitaire  causée  par  la \npandémie de COVID-19, Cerrejón a réorienté ses contributions pour \nfournir une aide humanitaire et atténuer les effets de la pandémie \nde Covid-19 à La Guajira. Entre mars et juin, cet investissement a \natteint USD 2,6 millions et s’est concentré sur le renforcement des \ncapacités des institutions sanitaires locales, avec la livraison de 100 \n000 produits de santé – dont 3 ventilateurs destinés aux hôpitaux \nlocaux –, la distribution de 12 millions de litres d’eau potable aux \ncommunautés, la livraison de plus de 50 000 paniers de nourriture \nà 400 communautés ethniques, et fait don du premier laboratoire \nqui effectuera des tests PCR moléculaires à La Guajira, soutenant \nainsi les efforts de la région pour détecter la Covid-19 et d’autres \nvirus. Ce don de Cerrejón comprend l’équipement, les fournitures, \nl’infrastructure et la formation du personnel de l’hôpital de Maicao \nqui supervisera le laboratoire."}

As a part of this, we\nmust ensure the integrity of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) across our operations and legacy assets to\nprotect our people, the environment and communities in which we operate1.\n\nTSFs are dynamic structures that can comprise of multiple dams (or cells) that have contiguous, structurally\nsimilar interconnected walls but are operated under the same tailings disposal regime. Maintaining the\nintegrity of these TSFs requires consideration of a range of factors, including appropriate engineering design,\nquality construction, ongoing operating discipline and effective governance processes and transparency.\n\nFollowing the Brumadinho incident, BHP established a Tailings Taskforce that reports to our Executive\nLeadership Team and the Board’s Sustainability Committee. The Taskforce is working to ensure best\npractice is embedded consistently across BHP, which includes learning the lessons from both the\nBrumadinho and Samarco events.\n\nTailings Storage Facility Safety Management\n\nAs part of the management of our TSFs, we implement controls that are designed to both prevent a TSF\nfailure and reduce the impacts of a failure should this occur. Our short-term strategy is focused on reducing\npotential downstream impact zones. For example, at Olympic Dam, a barrier wall is being constructed.\n\nRisks associated with TSFs are identified as principal risks to BHP under our Group Risk Architecture. This\nprovides additional visibility of TSF risks and the steps that are being taken to manage those risks across the\norganisation. BHP uses the ‘three lines of defence’ model of risk governance and management to define the\nrelationships and clarify the roles of different teams across the organisation in managing risk. Effective\nmonitoring systems, routine surveillance and review are central to ongoing dam integrity and governance.\nThird party experts and regulators conduct regular inspections and reviews on our facilities and we regularly\nreview and test our Emergency Response Plans and warning systems.\n\nTailings Storage Facility Design\n\nMaintaining TSF integrity over the entire life cycle of the TSF from initial planning to ultimate closure and\nrehabilitation is guided by the principles and criteria specified through the Australian National Committee on\nLarge Dams (ANCOLD), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA) and local regulation.\n\nThe safe design and operation of a TSF is influenced by many factors, including proximity of the dam to\nemployees, communities, infrastructure and other sensitive areas, the geological conditions on which a dam\nis constructed, climatic and seismic factors and tailings deposition and characteristics\n\nTailings Storage Facility Classification\n\nTSFs are classified under the CDA system. The TSF classification is a risk management tool and provides\nguidance on the standard of care expected from dam owners and designers. The classification reflects the\nmodelled, hypothetical most significant possible failure mode without regard to probability and assuming that\n\n1 Legacy assets refers to those BHP-operated assets, or part thereof, located in the Americas that are in the closure phase\n\n\fall risk controls are ineffective. It does not reflect, and is not intended to reflect, the physical state of the dam,\nthe safety of the dam, or the likelihood of the dam failing.\n\nThe dam classification informs the design, surveillance and review components of dam management.\nTherefore, dams with a higher level CDA classification will be subject to more rigorous requirements than\ndams assessed to have a lower level CDA classification.\n\nTransparency and Collaboration\n\nWe support more detailed transparency and integrated disclosure around TSF management and will work\nwith the industry and community, regulatory and financial stakeholders to seek to achieve this. We support\nand have contributed to the development of the new Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management,\nwhich has been developed as an international standard for safer tailings management through a process co-\nconvened with the International Council on Mining and Metals, the United Nations Environment Programme\nand the Principles for Responsible Investing.\n\nOlympic Dam Tailing Storage Facilities\n\nWe are committed to ensuring the integrity of TSFs across our operated assets and legacy assets to protect\nour people, the environment and communities in which we operate.\n\nOlympic Dam has two active upstream TSFs and a non-active upstream TSF. These TSFs have been safely\nmanaged for over 30 years. These facilities were reviewed following the failure of the Fundão Dam at\nSamarco and no significant deficiencies to the stability of the dams were identified.\n\nOur approach to the design, operation and eventual closure/rehabilitation of TSF6 will be consistent with\ninternational standards and leading industry practice as represented by CDA and ANCOLD guidance.\n\nUpstream dam designs are well suited to regions that are dry, flat and have relatively low seismic activity.\nOlympic Dam, approximately 575 km north-north-west of Adelaide, South Australia, is in a region where\nthese conditions prevail. We undertook a rigorous process to determine the preferred tailings management\noption most applicable for the conditions at Olympic Dam. This included assessment of safety, social, and\nenvironmental considerations.\n\nBHP received South Australian and Commonwealth Government approvals for the construction of TSF6 at\nOlympic Dam in 2019. The new facility will not be operated until approval to operate has been granted by\nthe South Australian Government. Construction of the new TSF6 facility commenced in early 2020 after the\nnecessary primary approvals for construction had been received.\n\nIndigenous Peoples and Cultural Heritage in Australia\n\nBHP’s aim is to be a partner of choice for Indigenous peoples and to contribute through our relationships to\nthe economic empowerment, social development and cultural wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. Our\nrelationships are based on regular and extensive discussions on a range of issues, including our extractive\nactivities and broader support for Indigenous peoples, including employment and local procurement\nopportunities.\n\nBHP’s approach to cultural heritage in Australia is driven by the commitments that it has made in BHP’s\nIndigenous Peoples Policy Statement2, the BHP Indigenous Peoples Strategy3 and BHP’s Reconciliation\nAction Plan,4 and by BHP’s support for the Uluru Statement From the Heart.\n\nThe article makes reference to South Australian cultural heritage legislation. For BHP, the current legislative\nframework in Australia is only a starting point in relation to the management of cultural heritage. BHP’s\n\n2 https://www.bhp.com/our-approach/operating-with-integrity/indigenous-peoples/bhp-indigenous-peoples-policy-statement/\n3 https://www.bhp.com/-\n/media/documents/ourapproach/operatingwithintegrity/indigenouspeoples/170622_bhpbillitonindigenouspeoplesstrategy.pdf?la=en\n4 https://www.bhp.com/-\n/media/documents/ourapproach/operatingwithintegrity/indigenouspeoples/180717_bhpreconciliationactionplan.pdf?la=en\n\n\fpolicies, practices and agreements with Indigenous peoples well exceed the legislative framework. The\nCompany’s policies, practices and agreements focus on consultation, negotiation, partnership making and\nformal, mutually beneficial agreements.\n\nBHP is committed to working with Traditional Owners on the management of cultural heritage. One way that\nBHP achieves this is through land use agreements (and other similar agreements) developed in partnership\nwith Traditional Owners. BHP has many of these agreements in place across Australia, including with the\nKokatha and other Traditional Owner groups in South Australia.\n\nOne of the purposes of these agreements is to set out detailed processes that Traditional Owners and BHP\nagree will be followed before any heritage site can be disturbed. The specifics of these processes differ\nacross jurisdictions, but the key requirements typically include:\n(cid:127)\n\nongoing and regular dialogue and engagement with (and feedback by) Traditional Owners in relation to\ncultural heritage, which occurs through both informal and formal mechanisms;\nethnographic and archaeological surveys with Traditional Owners over any land that may be disturbed\nby BHP’s operations in order to identify any heritage sites and their significance;\nconsultation with Traditional Owners regarding ways to avoid, minimise and mitigate impacts to heritage\nsites, including inspections of the heritage sites that involve Traditional Owners, BHP representatives\nand an anthropologist or archaeologist; and\nactions to mitigate any disturbance to heritage sites (e.g. through excavation and safekeeping of\nartefacts).\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\n(cid:127)\n\nBHP also implements additional cultural heritage systems and processes. For example, BHP maintains\nheritage information databases that record detailed information in relation to heritage sites and consultations\nwith Traditional Owners.\n\nBeyond and complementary to these processes, BHP partners and invests in relationships and initiatives\nwith Indigenous peoples and Traditional Owners in areas such as education, environmental management,\narts and culture, rehabilitation and reconciliation. Some examples of this work can be found at:\nhttps://www.bhp.com/community/indigenous-partnerships/.\n\nThe article suggests that BHP intends to increase water extraction from the Great Artesian Basin to 50\nmillion litres per day. This is not BHP’s intention. BHP is considering a resource development strategy which\ncould result in water extraction from the Great Artesian Basin of up to 42 ML per day. However, the impacts\nof this strategy are still being assessed and the proposal remains subject to relevant government approvals\nand consents.\n\nFirst Nations Heritage Protection Alliance\n\nIn October BHP and the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance jointly agreed a path forward to enhance\nthe influence and voice of Traditional Owners in relation to heritage protection.\n\nFrom this work we have determined a set of shared Principles around Aboriginal Heritage in Australia which\nreaffirm BHP’s commitment to free, prior and informed consent in agreement making. Together, we agree\nthat regulatory regimes should respect and reflect these rights.\n\nThe Principles also reaffirm a shared commitment to self-determination for Aboriginal peoples, their right to\nspeak proudly and publicly about their culture and their heritage; and recognition that building a better\nunderstanding of Aboriginal cultural heritage in Australia is ongoing and together we can play an important\nrole.\n\nFor more information on Tailings Storage Facilities and our approach to cultural heritage and engaging and\nworking with Indigenous peoples, please see https://www.bhp.com/sustainability/.

Production is channeled through a railroad over \n\n1,000  km  long,  from  Carajás,  in  Pará,  to  the  Ponta  da  Madeira  Port,  in  São  Luís,  state  of \n\nMaranhão. The railroad is key to Vale’s exports, which are mainly bound to China. Conflicts \n\nwith  Indigenous  Peoples  are  piling  up  in  this  region.  Vale  is  accused  of  contaminating  the \n\nCateté river, main water source of the Xikrin Indigenous Land. An action filed in 2018 by the \n\nXikrin people demonstrates the direct impact that the mining company’s operations have had \n\nin  the  way  of  life  of  the  Xikrin  and  Kayapó  people.  The  mining  company,  which  had  its \n\noperations in the Onça Puma mine halted several times, denies the impacts. More recently, \n\nthe Covid-19 pandemic - which has not halted Vale’s activities - has aggravated the situation \n\nof  the  indigenous people  in the region. The Xikrin also  demand  compensation for past gold \n\nextraction activities and current copper extraction activities.” \n\nVale’s  Position:  Associations  representing  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté  and  Kayapó  Indigenous \n\nPeoples and Brazilian public authorities allege a negative impact on the health of communities \n\nnear the Onça Puma nickel mine, as well as that the plant's waste polluted the Cateté River \n\nwith heavy metals, which would have led to the fetal deformities and other serious diseases. \n\nIn  September 2017,  the  Federal  Court ordered  the  suspension  of extractive activities  in the \n\nmine  of  Onça  Puma,  conditioning  the  return  of  the  operation  to  the  proof,  by  Vale,  of  the \n\nimplementation  of  an  economic  and  environmental  management  project  to  compensate  the \n\nindigenous peoples affected by the activity. \n\nVale filed an appeal requesting the revision of the decision, and, based on the conclusions of \n\nthe  reports  prepared  by  judicial  experts  in  several  scientific  matters  (especially  limnology, \n\nbiology,  geology  and  metallurgy),  which  stated  that  there  was  no  causal  link  between  the \n\nmining operation of Onça Puma mine and the alleged contamination of the Cateté River, and \n\nso  the  enterprise  not  being  the  source  of  contamination  of  the  referred  watercourse.  Thus \n\nratifying  the  efficiency  of  the  operation  control  systems  and  the  existing  data  in  the  reports \n\nperiodically  forwarded  to  the  State  Environment  Secretariat  of  Pará  (SEMAS),  as  the \n\ncompetent environmental agency to license and inspect the mining enterprise. \n\n\fIt  should  be  noted that  the  Itacaiúnas  watershed,  which  includes  the  Cateté and Itacaiúnas \n\nRivers, their streams and contributors, is located in a geological region with a natural presence \n\nof metals such as iron, nickel, copper, among others, and, therefore, such metals are inherent \n\nto  the  characterization  of  the  region's  soil,  occurring  in  volumes  naturally  higher  than  those \n\nprovided for in the parameters of the legislation.  \n\nIn  September  2019,  the  President  of  the  Supreme  Federal  Court  (STF),  in  a  monocratic \n\ndecision  and  considering  the  information  and  the  reports  prepared  by  the  judicial  experts, \n\nreleased, until the final decision that analyzes the merits of the judicial demand, the return of \n\nthe operation of the Onça Puma mine. In addition, it ordered the release of judicial deposits to \n\nthe Xikrin  do  Cateté  and  Kayapó and the  monthly  payment to  them.  In  a  judgment  held  on \n\nSeptember 8, 2020, the STF confirmed, by majority vote, of its president's monocratic decision, \n\nin its entirety. \n\nAt a conciliation hearing held within the scope of the lawsuits pending at the Federal Civil Court \n\nof the Judicial Subsection of Redenção (PA), on November 4, 2020, a procedural agreement \n\nwas  signed  between  Vale,  Xikrin  do  Cateté  and  Kayapó,  and  Federal  Public  Prosecutor's \n\nOffice, counting on the positive manifestation of FUNAI and the State of Pará. There was also \n\nthe  temporary  suspension,  for  a  period  of  1  year,  of  the  procedural  course  of  lawsuit,  its \n\nresources and developments, as well as other legal proceedings in which the company and \n\nthese peoples appear as parties, jointly or separately, with the objective of creating a favorable \n\nand harmonious environment for construction, through a joint and participatory manner, in an \nagreement  that  may  close  all  these  lawsuits.  This  is  an  important  step  as  it  shows  the \nengagement with the Xikrin do Cateté People and their willingness to build a new relationship \n\nmodel. \n\nRegarding the S11D mine, the company informs that the project is duly licensed and that it is \n\nperiodically inspected by the competent bodies. Noting that, due to total physical impossibility, \n\nthe referred mining enterprise is not used and does not impact the first mentioned watercourse. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that, in the case of a dry operation enterprise (with a process that does \n\nnot need to capture and use water), one where its rainwater drainage flows into the opposite \n\nside to the Itacaiúnas Watershed (that is, to the Parauapebas Watershed), as well as because \n\nthere is a geological feature (mountain range) separating these watersheds, there is no need \n\nto  talk about contamination of the Itacaiúnas River by the S11D. In addition to the above, it \n\nshould be noted that the project is located more than 10 km from the Xikrin Indigenous Land, \n\na factor that,  supported by the legal assumptions established  in the  Interministry Ordinance \n\n\fNo. 60/2015, waivers the need to conduct a Study of the Indigenous Component. Nevertheless, \n\nVale, in compliance with a court decision, is currently in the process of carrying out said study.  \n\nLikewise, Vale and its subsidiary, Salobo Metais, inform that they comply with the legislation, \n\nthat the Salobo Mine project is duly licensed and is periodically inspected by competent bodies, \n\nand its operating license was renewed in 2018, after a strict assessment process by the Brazilian \n\nInstitute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). The company points \n\nout that, considering  the location of the Xikrin do  Cateté Indigenous Land upstream from the \n\nproject and its distance from the edge of said Indigenous Land (over22 kilometers), the Study of \n\nthe Indigenous Component, as in the case of the S11D Mine project and for the same reason \n\npresented in the previous paragraph – provisions of Interministry Ordinance No. 60/2015 – also \n\nfor the Salobo Mine project, it was not necessary to prepare the referred to study, at any stage \n\nof the licensing of the industrial unit, by decision of the competent environmental agency and \n\npursuant to current legislation.  \n\nCompliance with environmental requirements related to the Xikrin do Cateté indigenous people \n\nis  reported  annually  to  the  competent  environmental  agency  (IBAMA)  through  the  Annual \n\nEnvironmental Performance Report (RADA). Despite that, due to a court decision, the work plan \n\nfor the preparation of the Study on the Indigenous Component is in progress. \n\nFinally, it is important to note that, in addition to the primary responsibility of the State, Vale has \n\nbeen supporting the health of Xikrin do Cateté People, by providing complementary health care, \n\nas well as emphasizing that it maintains an open and continuous dialogue with this population \n\nand reinforces its respect for Xikrin do Cateté People. \n\nThe Indigenous Associations representing the Xikrin entered, in July this year, with a new lawsuit \n\nagainst VALE, IBAMA, FUNAI, ICMBIO and Brazilian Federal Government, this time questioning \n\nthe regularity of the environmental licensing process of the Projeto Alemão mine and requesting \n\npayment indemnity for the mining operation of the Igarapé Bahia Mine project, which has been \n\nclosed since the early 2000s. \n\nVale has not yet been cited in this process, however, it registers that, on November 13, the court \n\nof  the  2nd  Federal  Civil  Court  of  the  Judicial  Subsection  of  Marabá  decided  to  ignore  the \n\npreliminary injunctions made by the indigenous associations, including the unrealistic claim for \n\ndamages, rejecting the  claim of  urgency declared  by the Indigenous Associations,  as well as \n\nreinforcing the legal principle of presumption of legitimacy of administrative acts. \n\n\fFinally, it should be noted that the aforementioned lawsuit is one of those that will be reached \n\nby  the  procedural  agreement  signed  between  Vale,  Xikrin  do  Cateté  and  Federal  Public \n\nProsecutor’s Office, will be the target of a request to suspend its processing. This step is very \n\nimportant  for the  resolution  of this controversy and for the  consolidation of  a partnership and \n\ntrust relationship with these Indigenous Peoples. \n\nAnd that the various projects and programs, already underway, both with the Xikrin do Cateté \n\nand the Kayapó, are the result of this permanent engagement, the protagonism of the indigenous \n\npeople, and the long-term vision. \n\nAllegation: Breach of agreements with Indigenous People of the Rio Pindaré, Mãe Maria, \n\nXikrin and Arariboia Indigenous Lands - page 17 \n\nDescription: “The Carajás Railroad directly affects four Indigenous Lands: Rio Pindaré, Mãe \n\nMaria,  Xikrin  and  Arariboia.  The  company  is  accused  by  indigenous  people  of  repeatedly \n\nbreaking agreements settled to mitigate the impacts in the region.” \n\nVale’s Position: Regarding the Carajás Railroad (EFC), Vale clarifies that, since its construction \n\nin the early 1980s, the company carries out support activities to indigenous peoples, including \n\nactions in the health, education, production activities, among others. All railroad activities are \n\ncarried out in agreement with current legislation, respecting the rights of these populations. It \n\nshould be clarified that EFC has no influence on the Araribóia and Xikrin do Cateté indigenous \n\nlands.   \n\nSince  the  1980s,  Vale  has  been  supporting  the  Gavião  People  in  health  actions,  production \n\nactivities, among others. Currently, there is an Agreement in force that establishes the annual \n\namount of R$ 14 million, be transferred monthly to the indigenous associations of the Gavião \n\nPeople, which are responsible for applying the resources in their own ethnodevelopment. We \n\nalso  highlight  that  several ethnodevelopment  projects and Basic Environmental Plans (Social \n\nand Environmental Projects were implemented with the Awá and Guajajara people. \n\nVale seeks to maintain a respectful relationship and carries out actions that prevent, mitigate or \n\ncompensate for possible impacts of its operations on these populations through which the Iron \n\nRoad passes. Therefore, it has signed agreements with the Awá and other indigenous peoples \n\nwho live in the area of influence of the Carajás Railroad, through FUNAI, partners and directly \n\nwith indigenous associations. \n\n \n\fVale maintains a Cooperation Agreement to support the Awá, Guajajara and Ka'apor Indigenous \n\npeoples who inhabit the Caru, Awá and Alto Turiaçu Indigenous Lands and provide support to \n\nproductive activities focused on the ethnodevelopment of these populations. \n\nThe  Basic  Environmental  Plans  (Social  and  Environmental  Projects)  in  Brazil  usually  last  5 \n\nyears,  therefore  the  Awá  and  Guajajara  programs  are  entering  in  their  third  year  of \n\nimplementation , which comprises the construction of 04 collective spaces, using bioconstruction \n\ntechniques, intended for strengthening and revival of the indigenous culture. We also highlight \n\nthe important Territorial Protection activities, in partnership with FUNAI's Front for the Protection \n\nof Recent Contacted Indigenous People, with technical support and the provision of equipment, \n\nand \n\nthe  various \n\ntraining  activities,  which \n\ninclude  management  activities, \n\ninstitutional \n\nstrengthening, and support for productive activities. \n\nThe Commitment and Cooperation Term (TCC), settled between Vale, indigenous people and \n\nFUNAI. The main points of the TCC in 2019 were the construction of 05 flour mills in the Alto \n\nTuriaçu and Rio Pindaré Indigenous Lands, construction of 01 rice plant at Rio Pindaré and a \n\nsilo for storage  at the Awá Indigenous Land. Improvement works were also carried out at  05 \n\naccess  routes  to  the  Alto  Turiaçu  and  Awá  Indigenous  Land,  facilitating  movement  between \n\nvillages without the need to leave the Indigenous Lands. \n\nAllegation: Mining in Indigenous People – page 17 \n\nDescription:  “Although  denied,  Vale  also  receives  several  requests  for  exploitation  within \n\nIndigenous  Lands  in  the  Amazon  region.  Among  236  requests,  those  affecting  the \n\nTrombetas/Mapuera  Indigenous  Land  (TI)  should  be  noted,  located  between  the  states  of \n\nRoraima, Amazonas and Pará, with 68 requirements; Munduruku TI, in Pará, with 52 requests; \n\nTI Xikrin do Rio Catete (PA), with 37; Kayabi (PA), with 35; and Menkragnoti/Baú (MT/PA), with \n\n26.” \n\nVale’s  Position:  Vale  has  a  decade-long  relationship  with  indigenous  peoples  in  Brazil  and \n\nabroad, always respecting the rights, culture, interests and perspectives of these communities.  \n\nVale  complies  with  the  legislation  under  all  its  aspects  and  faithfully  complies  with  the \n\ninternationally  acknowledged  principle  of  Free  Prior  Informed  Consent  -  FPIC  for  the \n\ndevelopment of activities in approved Indigenous Lands.  \n\n \n\fVale  hereby  informs  that  it  does  not  carry  out  any  mineral  research  or  prospecting  activities \n\ncurrently in Brazil’s Indigenous Lands, neither mining concessions nor expected concessions. \n\nIn addition, the Vale production plan does not consider mineral resources or mineral reserves in \n\nBrazilian Indigenous territory. Vale also states that its current production plan does not comprise \n\nmineral resources or reserves within indigenous lands in Brazil.  \n\nThe company constantly reevaluates its mining process portfolio, including titles and research \n\nrequirements that fully or partially interfere with indigenous lands.  \n\nIn updated figures, Vale has 2 (two) titles in the Mining Requirement Phase, obtained prior to \n\nthe approval of the respective Indigenous Lands. \n\nAlso,  as  an  inheritance  of  the  State  Owned  company  period,  Vale  has  over  42  (forty-two) \n\nResearch Request processes in Indigenous Lands, in other words, processes that refer to an \n\nexpectation  of  concession,  while  up  to  the  present  moment  none  of  these  concessions \n\n(Research  Certifications)  were  granted.    It  should  be  noted  that  Vale  has  never  developed \n\nactivities  in  this  region  due  to  the  lack  of  property  and  regulation  by  the  Government.  \n\nFurthermore,  most  of  these  research  requirements  were  recorded  prior  to  the  approval  of \n\nrespective Indigenous Lands.  \n\nWhile the National Mining Agency (ANM) website states a higher number of processes under \n\nGrupo  Vale  companies,  most  of  these  processes  were  waivered/closed  by  Vale  itself,  only \n\npending approval by ANM or refusal by the Agency itself. \n\nRegardless  of  eventual  approval  of  any  mining  laws  in  Brazilian  Indigenous  Lands,  Vale \n\nreinforces  the  commitment  established  in  its  Global  Human  Rights  Policy  to  address  the \n\nprinciples  of  the  “Position  Statement  on  Mining  and  Indigenous  Lands”  of  the  International \n\nCouncil on Mining and Metals - ICMM, with compulsory observance of the free prior informed \n\nconsent of indigenous peoples in order to develop any activities in Indigenous Lands in Brazil or \n\nanywhere in the world. \n\nAllegation: Damage  to  the  health of  the  Tembé  people  caused  by  operations  of  a Vale \n\nsubsidiary company - Biopalma - page 17 \n\nDescription: “In addition, a Vale subsidiary company, Biopalma, processes palm oil in Pará, \n\nand the massive use of agrotoxins in crops directly affects the health of the Tembé people, as \n\nwell as polluting rivers and streams. Contamination was attested by technical analysis.” \n\n \n\fVale’s  Position:  On  Biopalma’s  actions,  the  company  clarifies  that  is  does  not  perform  any \n\nactivities in the indigenous land. It should be emphasized that agrochemicals and pesticides are \n\nnot  used  in  crop  areas  near  indigenous  lands.  The  techniques  used  in  planting  palm  strictly \n\ncomplies with environmental rules and controls, with no negative impact to the environment.” \n\nAllegation:  Environmental  Damage  caused  by  the  breaking  of  the  Mariana  Dam  cause \n\nenvironmental damages to the Tupiniquim, Guarani and Krenak people - page 19 \n\nDescription: “Despite not taking place in the Amazon region, it is impossible to talk about Vale \n\nand not mention its involvement in the greatest environmental disasters in Brazilian history. On \n\nNovember 2015, the breaking of a mining tailings dam in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern \n\nBrazil, unleashed a wave of toxic mud that ran nearly 700 km until it reached and contaminated \n\nthe Atlantic Ocean, near the  state  of Espírito Santo.  The destruction of the  Rio  Doce directly \n\naffected  the  Krenak  Indigenous  tribe,  in  Governador  Valadares  (MG).  Ailton  Krenak,  an \n\nimportant  indigenous writer and  thinker,  gives  us  the  dimension of  the  importance  of the  Rio \n\nDoce to his people. “It is simply irreplaceable because we refuse to admit it is dead. This is why \n\nwe are at the left bank of the Rio Doce, standing vigil over the body of this relative of ours, Watu, \n\nour grandfather. The Krenak will not leave. Even if Vale rains fire over our village to remove us, \n\nwe will stand our ground. It is an extremely difficult thing to understand for people who have not \n\nexperienced  something  like  this.”.  In  the  state  of  Espírito  Santo,  the  Tupiniquim  people  also \n\nfights for compensation, since the water in the region is completely contaminated.” \n\nVale’s Position: Vale's relationship with Tupiniquim and Guarani Indigenous Peoples is due to \n\ntheir relationship with the EFVM (Vitória Minas Railway) and Barra do Riacho Branch Line, which \n\nculminated  in  the  environmental  licensing  process  and  the  preparation  of  the  Indigenous \n\nComponent  Studies  and  the  implementation  of  the  Basic  Environmental  Plan  (PBA)  for  the \n\nIndigenous Component of the Comboios and Tupiniquim-Guarani Indigenous Lands – PBACI. \n\nSince then, for conducting this relationship, Vale has a dedicated and experienced professional \n\nwho  establishes  an  open  and  clear  dialogue  with  these  communities  in  the  process  of \n\nimplementing the impact mitigation actions established in the PBA. Due to the breaking of the \n\nFundão  Dam,  a  Consent  Decree  (TTAC)  has  been  established,  which  provides  for  the \n\nimplementation of the Protection and Remediation Program for the Quality of Life of Indigenous \n\nPeoples and Traditional Communities, in order to mitigate, remediate, recover and compensate \n\nfor the social, economic, environmental and cultural impacts that may be identified, as well as \n\n \n\fpromoting the integrated development of indigenous communities directly or indirectly impacted \n\nin the area within the scope of the event. \n\nIn relation to the Krenak People, the relationship is also due to the Vitoria Minas Railway. Since \n\n2008, through an agreement, Vale has supported the project for the productive activity of dairy \n\nfarming, in addition to the construction of cultural centers and environmental actions. Like the \n\nTupiniquim  and  Guarani,  the  Krenak  are  part  of  the  actions  addressed  in  the  scope  of  the \n\nremediation due to the rupture of the Fundão Dam. \n\nVale points out that the Renova Foundation was created in 2016, with the purpose of carrying \n\nout actions to redress and compensate for the impacts associated with the breaking of Fundão \n\ndam, which occurred on November 5, 2015. It was provided for in the Consent Decree (TTAC) \n\nsigned between Samarco, its shareholders Vale and BHP Billiton, the Federal Government, the \n\nStates of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo and several public authorities at the federal and state \n\nlevels.  \n\nTherefore, the Renova Foundation manages and performs reparation actions, including, but not \n\nlimited to, the transfer of financial aid, supply of inputs, road maintenance and well drilling. The \n\nRenova Foundation challenges some allegations about water quality, since they are inconsistent \n\nand  were  made  without  the  necessary  technical  and  scientific  rigor  to  demonstrate  causal \n\nconnection with the breaking of the Fundão dam.  \n\nFor  further  information  on  monitoring  the  programs  to  redress  the  damage  caused  by  the \n\nbreaking \n\nof \n\nthe \n\nFundão \n\ndam, \n\nplease \n\nvisit \n\nthe \n\ninstitution's \n\nwebsite: \n\nhttps://www.fundacaorenova.org \n\nAllegation:  Lack  of  assistance  to  the  Pataxó  and  Pataxó  Hã  Hã  Hãe  people \n\nimpacted by the breaking of the Vale dam in Brumadinho/MG - page 19. \n\nDescription: “A new Vale dam breaking, this time in Brumadinho, on January 2019, killed \n\n270 people and affected the Naô Xohã settlement, belonging to the Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe \n\npeople. Nowadays, the Pataxó were forced to move to the outskirts of Belo Horizonte. On \n\nSeptember 2020, 20 months after the Brumadinho dam broke, Vale announced R$ 12.4 \n\nbillion in payment to shareholders, while still no proper compensation is handed out to \n\naffected communities and victims’ families.” \n\n \n\fVale’s  Position:  Firstly,  Vale  reports  that,  due  to  the  consequential  impacts  of  the \n\nbreaking  of  the  Brumadinho  dam,  Vale  S.A.  entered  into  an  Emergency  Preliminary \n\nConsent Decree (TTAP) with the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office in April 2019, with \n\nthe purpose of regulating issues related to the specific satisfaction of the needs of the \n\nPataxó and Hã Hã Hãe indigenous groups, residing in Naô Xohã settlement, located in \n\nthe municipality of São Joaquim de Bicas (MG) and in Belo Horizonte (MG).  \n\nThe  National  Indigenous  Peoples  Foundation  (FUNAI)  has  issued,  in  12/13/2018,  a \n\nPataxó  Nahô  Xohã  Land  Qualification  Report,  which  attested  that  the  Naô  Xohã \n\nSettlement is not a Traditionally Occupied Indigenous Land. This is a recent occupation, \n\nand the area was owned by MMX/EBX company and was recently acquired in an auction \n\nby  another  legal  entity.  According  to  the  report,  the  indigenous  people  occupied  the \n\nlocation on November 2017 invited by the Brazil’s Landless Workers' Movement (MST), \n\nwhich already had built the “Pátria Livre” (“Free Nation”, in Portuguese) settlement nearby \n\nsince  June  2017,  and  representatives  of  the  Puri,  Pataxó,  Karajá  and  Kambioá  have \n\nsettled on the location. When FUNAI visited in June 2018, 15 families lived in the village, \n\nnamed Naô Xohã (“Warrior Spirit”). These families were basically from the Pataxó and \n\nPataxó Hã Hãe ethnicities, while families from other ethnicities occasionally visited the \n\noccupation. Most indigenous individuals that comprised the settlement’s population came \n\nfrom southern Bahia (municipalities of Santa Cruz Cabrália, Coroa Vermelha and Barra \n\nVelha). They now live in Belo Horizonte or in its metropolitan zone for almost 15 years.  \n\nOn  March  2019,  relatives  of  one  group  of  the  Naô  Xohã  settlement  left  the  village, \n\nclaiming a  lack of  safety,  due to  external threats, since  then mostly living  in the Bairro \n\nTaquaril, Jardim Vitória and Parque São Pedro districts of the city of Belo Horizonte. The \n\ngroup’s  reasons  for  leaving  were  officially  recorded  by  the  deputy  Chief  Werymerry \n\n(Kenya)  in  two  documents,  dated  March  18  and  25,  sent  via  e-mail  to  FUNAI,  to  the \n\nFederal Public Prosecutor’s Office and to Vale. The board requested that any dealings \n\nwith Vale were carried out, from then on, separately from the group that remained in the \n\nNaô  Xohã  settlement.  Vale  took  notice  of  the  group’s  request,  adding  them  to  the \n\ncompensation actions. Since the split occurred last March, Vale assists both indigenous \n\ngroups  and  all  remediation  actions  are  scheduled  and  carried  out  in  this  sense,  while \n\nconsidering the specifics of each case. \n\nWithin the scope of the aforementioned Emergency Preliminary Consent Decree (TTAP), \n\nVale. has been carrying out structuring actions for the full reparation of indigenous groups, \n\n\faimed at economic restructuring, through monthly financial assistance, the full restoration \n\nof indigenous health, through a specific program to monitor the situation of families in the \n\npost-collapse period and primary assistance. \n\nIn the first months, emergency social assistance and health actions for indigenous people \n\nwere carried out by the company, which provided about 10 tons of protein until May 2019, \n\nabout 3,300 cleaning and personal hygiene items, about 900 household items and other \n\nessential items. \n\nIt should be noted that,  in February 2019, based on a project prepared by the Special \n\nIndigenous  Sanitary  District  (DSEI  Minas  Gerais  and  Espírito  Santo),  Vale  installed  a \n\n10,000 liter water tank and a distribution network to bring drinking water with a tap to each \n\nhome, in addition to distributing ceramic water filters to families. Piped water is supplied \n\nby Copasa's network and consumption costs are paid by the mining company. For better \n\nconsumption conditions, since November 2019, Vale also supplies 1,500 liters of mineral \n\nwater  weekly  to the  Naô  Xohã  village,  following  the  volume  of  consumption per capita \n\nrecommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization.  Therefore,  during  the  emergency \n\nperiod, Vale guaranteed full assistance to the indigenous people, ensuring both the health \n\nand food security of those affected. \n\nIn  this  regard,  Vale  works  in  conjunction  with  the  Special  Indigenous  Sanitary  District \n\n(DSEI MG-ES), the National Indigenous Peoples Foundation (FUNAI), the State Health \n\nDepartment  and  the  local  health  departments  of  São  Joaquim  de  Bicas  and  Belo \n\nHorizonte.  These  bodies  are  part  of  the  Interinstitutional  Committee  for  Monitoring  the \n\nHealth Diagnosis (CIADS) in the context of remediation to the Pataxó and Pataxó Hã-Hã-\n\nHãe indigenous Peoples. \n\nVale  S.A.  also  signed  a  Cooperation  Agreement  with  the  Health  Department  of  the \n\nMunicipality of São Joaquim de Bicas in order to support the public agency in assisting \n\nthe  indigenous  of  the  Naô  Xohã  village  and  installing  in  the  location  occupied  by  the \n\nindigenous people, with the consent of competent bodies, a Basic Health Unit, toilets and \n\nbathrooms. In addition to the above, TAP-E Pataxó also provides for the contracting of \n\nan  independent  technical  consultancy  for  the  indigenous  people  and  a  social  and \n\neconomic consultancy that will make the diagnosis of impacts and damages aiming at the \n\ntotal reparation of the community, both processes are in progress under the direction of \n\nthe MPF (Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office) and FUNAI."}

Total have also had the opportunity to comment on a draft report communicated \nto us on July 10, 2020. \n\nTotal  recognizes  the  value  of  the  Community-based  approach  taken  in  this  assessment,  which  is \ncomplementary  to  the  engagement  and  consultation  with  affected  communities  carried  out  by  Total \nteams as part of the environmental and social impact assessment of our projects. Total is interested in \npursuing the dialogue with FIDH and FHRI with a view to reinforcing our ambition on certain points and \nexchanging on best practice.  Some recommendations are useful and will be taken as a basis to progress.  \n\nHowever,  Total  disagrees  with  some  of  the  statements  made  in  this  report  especially  concerning  the \nTilenga oil exploration and production project, of which Total E&P Uganda is the operator. \n\nTotal  reminds that there are several projects in the lake Albert Region:  \nTilenga operated by Total EP Uganda , EACOP led by Total , Kingfisher operated by CNOOC , in which Total \nEP Uganda is partner. And other projects where Total is neither operator nor shareholder (the Refinery, \nthe airport , the roads) and which are led by the Ugandan Authorities. \n\nTotal regrets that the report refers to a single project (so called in the report “the Lake Albert Oil Project”) \nwhich creates an amalgamation of responsibilities.  \nIt would also have been preferable if the report had distinguished on the one hand the direct responsibility \nof each of the parties (e.g Total E&P Uganda as Operator of the Tilenga Project or UNOC operator of the \nRefinery)  and  on  the  other  the  expectation  that  parties  will  use  their  leverage    to  influence  business \nrelationships as per UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which Total adheres to. Finally \nand as a result of the amalgamation mentioned above, the report leads to unfounded insinuations that \nTotal may have taken part in human rights violations, which is not substantiated and which Total denies. \n\nThe attached document provides a non-exhaustive list of Total’s comments. The following points are of \nparticular concern:  \n\nStakeholder consultations  \n\nThe report does not fully reflect the structured approach and the scale of the means deployed by Total \nE&P  Uganda  to  identify  the  potential  impacts  of  the  Tilenga  project  and  define  the  measures  to  be \nimplemented to respond to them.  \n\nThe social and environmental impact study of the Tilenga project is the result of four years of iterative \nwork bringing together different expertise. The consultation stage involved the participation of 10,000 \npeople and an approval process by the Ugandan authorities. On the field, 35 locally recruited Community \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nLiaison Officers were deployed to maintain a permanent dialogue with the local communities, collect their \nconcerns  and  keep  them  informed.  This  ESIA report has  been elaborated by independent  National \nEnvironment  Management  Authority  (NEMA)  registered  Environmental  Practitioners  from  AECOM \nUganda Limited (AECOM) and Eco & Partner Consult, based on numerous studies. NEMA mandated an \nindependent  review  by  the  internationally  recognized  Netherlands  Commission  for  Environmental \nAssessment (NCEA).   \n\nSome misunderstandings with the communities noted in the FIDH report had already been identified by \nthe  Total  E&P  Uganda  teams  and  measures  taken  to  resolve  them.  For  example,  Total  E&P  Uganda \nreinforced communications towards local communities around cut-off dates and the need to continue \ncultivation afterward, notably through radio broadcasted messages.  \n\nCompensation framework \n\nThe project was designed with the overarching concern of limiting the impacts on local communities and \nin particular the need to relocate households. For the acquisition of the necessary land, a framework of \nfair compensation and relocation has been established following International Finance Corporation (IFC – \na  world  bank  organization)  standards,  recognized  to  represent  best  practice,  and  validated  by  the \nUgandan authorities. The first relocation action plan, known as RAP1 concerned 622 households affected \nby the project. More than 4000 meetings were held with the people concerned. \n\nCompensation rates were defined based on local market studies and were set above market prices. Other \nlivelihood restoration measures have been, and will continue to be, implemented such as training and \nactivities related to agriculture. \n\nAt  the  end  of  the  RAP  1,  a  follow-up  report  on  a  sample  of  223  households  affected  by  the  project  \nobserved an overall improvement in their standard of living including in particular: securing of title deeds \nto  property,  better  access  to  hospitals  and  clinics  (1.7%  to  37.2%)  and  the  enrollment  of  children  in \nsecondary school which has doubled from 10.8% to 20.4%.  \n\nLivelihood  and  training  programs  have  also  been  undertaken  at  household  level  through  a  third  part \nCommunity Integrated Development Initiatives (CIDI)1.  \n\nListening to the possible dissatisfaction of the communities \n\nThe  project  has  established  a  grievance  mechanism  for  collecting  and  dealing  with  dissatisfaction  and \ncomplaints from all stakeholders and this mechanism is being effectively used by the communities. As \npart of the RAP1, Total E&P Uganda collected 170 complaints between January 2018 and the end of 2019. \n87%  of  them  have  been  resolved  to  date.  This  mechanism  provides  for  different  levels  of  resolution, \n\n1 The programs include establishment of high yielding cassava gardens for 100 households who started to and are \ncontinuing to harvest this enhanced variety in 2020 allowing subsistence for their families as well as being able to \nsell off some cassava as well as cuttings. Many have also replanted the same cuttings in their additional gardens. \nValue addition and better storage practices are ongoing. 42 Vegetable gardens were established, and 10 households \nbenefited from 10 apiaries and some have started harvesting honey. A tree nursery has been established to give out \nup to 8000 seedlings to the community.  \nTrainings have also been undertaken for project affected persons (PAPs) to enhance their livelihoods in Agriculture \nthrough 9 farmer groups that are operational. Financial Literacy programs were undertaken and PAPs and other \nHousehold members especially Women and Youth were encouraged to attend these. In addition, driving lessons \nwere offered to PAPs and 5 have since received their driving permits (one of them got a job ferrying sugarcane at \none of the many plantations in Hoima). \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nnotably the intervention of third parties for an impartial resolution if the solution proposed by Total E&P \nUganda does not satisfy the complainant. \n\nProtection of human rights defenders \n\nTotal  cannot  accept  the  allegation,  which  is  totally  unsubstantiated,  that  some  of  its  employees  and \ncontractors played a role in an act of intimidation against a stakeholder. \n\nTotal recognizes the importance of protecting human rights defenders and has initiated discussions with \nFIDH in order to better understand the difficulties that human rights defenders may encounter and better \nengage with them. Earlier this year, the representatives of Total E&P Uganda also had the opportunity to \nreiterate during meetings with various Ugandan authorities in Kampala, that all actions undertaken within \nthe framework of the Tilenga project must ensure the strictest respect for human rights. \n\nTo reiterate, Total does not tolerate or contribute to attacks, or physical or legal threats, against those \nwho exercise their human right to freedom of expression, peaceful protest or assembly, including where \nthey are acting as human rights defenders. \n\nTo  illustrate  Total’s  action  on the  ground  in  terms  of  HR and  security,  it can  be underlined  that  every \nquarter,  Total  E&P  Uganda  provides  trainings  on  Voluntary  Principles  on  Security  and  Human  Rights \n(VPSHR)  to  employees  of  private  security  companies  but  also  police  forces  working  in  the  area  of  the \nTilenga project. The most recent training was extended to contractors. \n\nNet gain commitment on biodiversity \n\nRegarding environmental issues, Total is well aware of the sensitivity of the project given the proximity of \nboth the Murchinson Falls Park and Lake Albert. Total E&P Uganda has not only shown a great level of \ncaution in the avoidance and mitigation measures proposed and approved through the  Environmental \nand Social Impact Assessment process, but it has also made a public commitment to achieve a biodiversity \nnet  gain,  contributing  to  an  overall  better  biodiversity  in  the  Murchison  Falls  Conservation  Area  than \nbefore work started. \n\nConcrete  actions  are  put  in  place.  As  an  example,  a  Biodiversity  Stakeholder  Engagement  (BSE)  was \nconcluded with several environmental NGOs in 2016. Quarterly consultations are implemented with said \norganizations.  These  exchanges  have  improved  the  relationships  with  these  groups  on  the  ground. \nAnother  example,  the  Biodiversity  Ecosystems  Services  Plan  incorporates  Community  Environment \nConservation Program and further consultation on these were held August 2020 in order to ensure the \nbest possible level of environmental protection of communities’ areas. This resulted in an Environment \nNo Net Loss Program. \n\nDespite certain key points of disagreement, Total acknowledges the value of FIDH report and wishes to \nmaintain a constructive dialogue in relation to the Tilenga Project.  Total welcomes and agrees with many \nof FIDH‘s suggestions and recommendations, on issues like the protection of human rights defenders by \nall stakeholders, or the need to ensure that for RAP 2 to 5 affected communities have access to updated \nfinancial compensation and regular information particularly when delays may occur or have occurred.  \n\nTotal  would  welcome  the  opportunity  to  pursue  a  constructive  dialogue  with  FIDH  to  address  the \nrecommendations made in the FIDH report in a detailed manner and to consider possible improvements, \nbuilding on the initiatives already put in place by Total E&P Uganda and their planned updated Human \nRights Impact Assessment on its operation in Tilenga. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nAnnex \n\nComments  on FIDH-FHRI Community-Based Human  Rights Impact  Assessment of  the  Lake  Albert  Oil \nExtraction Project and Related Developments in the Albertine Graben, Uganda  \n\nThe following comments refer to certain issues on which Total wishes to provide additional clarity. This \nlist is not intended to be exhaustive.  Total regrets that many of the comments communicated by Total to \nFIDH directly on the draft version of the report prior to its official publication by FIDH, have not been \nincluded nor reflected in the final report. \n\nThe numbering in this Annex follows the numbering in the report (and therefore is not complete).  \n\n1 Introduction  \n\nProject definition  \n\nA clear  distinction  should  be  made  between the  various oil  and  gas  development projects in \nUganda. Clarity in this respect would facilitate the identification of best practices and promotion of such \npractices in projects with a less well developed social and environmental background.  \n\nDefinition of Parties  \n\nIn relation to Total an unhelpful amalgamation is made between various distinct legal entities. Total E&P \nUganda and Total East Africa Midstream BV are wholly owned subsidiaries of Total SE. However it is not \ncorrect \nin \nthe context of its Ugandan operations, should be understood to refer to  the same entity,  as  the  France-\nbased Corporation is entirely responsible for the activities of its subsidiary”.   \n\nto  state that “Accordingly,  all references to  “Total”  or \n\nto  “Total  E&P  Uganda,” \n\nFrench Vigilance Law  \n\nWith  respect  to  the  reports  references  to  the  French  Vigilance Law,   this Law  requires  large  French \ncompanies  to  establish  and  effectively  implement  an  internal  vigilance  plan  (hereafter  “Vigilance \nPlan”), with reasonable measures to identify and prevent risks that can have serious impacts on human \nrights and the environment resulting from its activities, those of the companies it controls, and those of \nsubcontractors and suppliers with whom it has an established business relationship. The Vigilance Plan \nand  a  report  of  its  implementation  must  be  included  in  companies’  annual  management  report. Total \nS.E.’s Vigilance Plan is updated on a yearly basis, most recently in its 2019 Annual Report dated 20 March \n2020. Its implementing report for 2019 includes a section dedicated to the implementation of the plan in \nthe EACOP and Tilenga Projects.  \n\n2 The Lake Albert Oil Extraction Project  \n\n2.2 Companies involved  \nThe description of Total does not fully reflect the reality of the commitment and resources that Total and \nits subsidiaries devoted to Human Rights.   \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nAs  early  as  2002  Total adhered  to  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact.  In  2012,  it  became  an  official \nmember  of  the  Voluntary  Principles  on  Security  and Human  Rights Initiative,  which  promotes  guiding \nprinciples  from  companies  on  providing  operational  security  while  respecting Human  Rights.  As  from \n2011,  Total  committed  to  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and Human \nRights (UNGPs). Also in 2011, the first Total Human Rights guide was published, and this has since been \nregularly updated. Total is also a member of the multi stakeholders “Extractive Industries Transparency \nInitiative  (EITI)”  aiming  to  promote  the  transparent  and  responsible  management  of  natural \nresources.  More details of Total’s approach to Human Rights and fundamental freedoms can be found on \nour website.. \n\nIt is particularly disappointing to note the report’s reference to the controversy in Myanmar which relates \nto allegations of forced labour during the construction some 25 years ago of a major gas pipeline jointly \nowned  by  Total  and  the  state-owned  oil  and  gas  company. In  2008  the  case  against  Total  for  alleged \nviolations  in  Myanmar  was  definitively  dismissed  by  the  Belgian Cour  de  Cassation,  ending  the \nproceedings.  Today, Total is a  key  player  in  local  development  in  Myanmar. It  has an  extensive  social \npolicy for its employees as well as a far-reaching societal program targeting education, public health, local \njob  creation,  micro-finance  and  access  to  energy. A  report conducted  by  independent  NGO  CDA \nfollowing field  visits  in  Myanmar is publicly available. The  World  Economic  Forum  has  also  recognized \nTotal for its “responsible investment in fragile contexts” in a study published in May 20166.  \n\n2.4 Legal Actions Initiated Against the Project  \nTotal  S.E. and its subsidiaries in  Uganda  are  committed  to  respecting  the  rule  of  law  in  all  countries  in \nwhich they are present, and this is a key tenant of the Group’s Code of Conduct.   \n\nGPFG & AFIEGO vs. NEMA & PAU  \nlegal  action  on Tilenga’s Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) in \nIn  relation  to  the \nUganda, two applications for Judicial Review were filed in the Civil Division of the High Court at Kampala \non 15 May 2019 by Guild Presidents’ Forum on Governance and Africa Institute for Energy Governance \n(AFIEGO) respectively,  against Petroleum  Authority  of  Uganda  (PAU)  and  the  National  Environment \nManagement Authority (NEMA). Total E&P Uganda is not a party to this case.  \n\nTotal understands that the applications are based on alleged procedural irregularities relating notably to \nthe eligibility of the presiding officer of public hearings. \nThe  application  was  scheduled  for  hearing  on  20  November  2019,  16  December  2019  and  3  February \n2020. On all three occasions it was adjourned, once to allow PAU to file TEPU affidavits and twice because \nthe applicants asked to cross examine a NEMA official on his affidavit, but the official was not present in \ncourt. The hearing was scheduled to proceed on 15 April 2020. However, due to the suspension of court \nhearings as a preventative measure against the spread of COVID-19, the hearing did not proceed. Total \nunderstands the next hearing is now scheduled for November 17th, 2020.  \n\nLes Amis  de \nAFIEGO & Others vs. Total S.E.  \n\nla  Terre  France, the  National  Association  of  Professional Environmentalists, \n\nOn October 29, 2019, six  NGOs filed two applications against Total S.E. before the Tribunal Judiciaire of \nNanterre, for  interim  measures  under  Article  L.226-102-4  of  the French Code  of  Commerce.  The \nunderlying contention is two-fold : i) it is argued that Total’s Vigilance Plan fails to comply with the Law \ninsofar  as  the  Plan’s  risk  mapping  and  account  of  preventive  measures  published  in  the  2018  Total’s \n\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nmanagement  report  fail  to  specifically  mention  the Tilenga and  EACOP Projects;  ii) it  is  alleged  that \nthe Tilenga Project resulted in Human Rights violations and that such failings would constitute evidence \nthat  Total’s  Vigilance  Plan  is  not  effectively  implemented.  The  NGOs  have  therefore  requested  that i) \nTotal SE amends  its  Vigilance  Plan;  ii)  Total SE orders  Total  E&P  Uganda  to  effectively  implement  the \nprinciples laid out in the “Land Resettlement and Acquisition Framework” concluded with the Ugandan \ngovernment.  \n\nFollowing the hearing that took place on December 12, 2019, the Nanterre Tribunal Judiciaire declined \njurisdiction in favour of the commercial tribunal of Nanterre. The NGOs have appealed this decision. The \nnext hearing is scheduled for October 28, 2020.  \n\nTotal categorically objects to the allegation that the Duty of Vigilance Law has been breached. The risk \nmapping set out the Vigilance Plan has been conducted in accordance with the principles of both the OECD \nand the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework in relation to reporting on Human Rights risks. The \nLaw does not require a detailed project by project risk mapping to be published; such a level of detail \nwould require companies to publish a Vigilance Plan several thousand pages long which would manifestly \nbe in contradiction with the spirit of the law.  \n\nTotal  S.E.  has  ensured  that  its  subsidiaries  implement  the  Vigilance  Plan  in  a  diligent  manner  notably \nthrough the adoption of rules, principles and internal process including internal audit. It is in application \nof  these  internal  rules  that  Total  E&P  Uganda  concluded  the  “Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nFramework” (LARF) with the Ugandan Government thereby ensuring that the project meets the highest \ninternational standards for the protection of Human Rights.   \n\n3.1 Human Rights Defenders: Violence, harassment and impunity in the Albertine Region.   \n\nThe report makes serious allegations in relation to Total’s conduct, which Total wishes to strongly refute.   \n\nOn  December  26,  2019,  Friends  of  the  Earth  France, Survie and  the  Observatory  for  the  Protection \nof Human  Rights Defenders  published  a  press  release  reporting  on alleged acts  of  intimidation  and \nthreatening behavior by \"men unknown '' which occurred on December 23 and 24, 2019 with regard to \none  of  two  Ugandan  nationals  who travelled  to  Paris  with  the  aim  of testifying at  the  hearing  of  the \nNanterre Tribunal Judiciaire on  December  12,  2019 in the Les  Amis  de  la  Terre  France,  the  National \nAssociation  of  Professional  Environmentalists,  AFIEGO  &  Others  vs.  Total  S.A case. The  statement \nalso suggested that  a  Total  E&P  Uganda  employee had spread  false  information  to  local  communities \nabout one of the two witnesses, claiming that he had lied during his testimony in France.  \n\nTotal  E&P  Uganda  categorically  states  that  it  has  played  no  part  in  acts  of  intimidation  and \nthreats. Following the press reports internal enquiries were immediately made and it was confirmed that \nneither Total  E&P  Uganda staff nor its  contractors  were  active  on project activities in  Kampala  or  in \nthe Tilenga project  area  between  December  23,  2019  and  January  2,  2020.  Total  regrets  the  false \nallegations of inappropriate  behavior  on  the  part  of  Total  E&P  Uganda  employees which seriously \ndamages their reputation and potentially puts them in serious danger. In particular, Total E&P Uganda is \nextremely concerned about the false accusations made against its Community Liaison Officer who was \npublicly named by the NGO Survie’s December 26, 2019 press release. Not only do these unsubstantiated \naccusations  pose  a  serious  threat  to his safety,  but  they undermine and  jeopardize the important role \nplayed by CLOs in ensuring dialogue with local communities.  \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nMore generally, Total does not tolerate or contribute to attacks, physical or legal threats, against those \nwho safely and lawfully exercise their human right to freedom of expression, peaceful protest or assembly, \nincluding where they are acting as human rights defenders.  \n\n3.2 The right to land  \n\nLand Acquisition Process Generally  \n\nTotal E&P Uganda has taken considerable care to apply international best practice with respect to land \nissues  and  resettlement  of  people.  Numerous  impact  studies have  been conducted  including but not \nlimited to:   \n\nSocial and Health Baseline Study,   \nEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)7,   \nIndustrial Baseline Survey,   \nLake Albert Regional Social - Economic Baseline Assessment,   \nAgricultural  Value  Chain  Analysis  in Buliisa,  Market  and  Asset  Valuation  Assessment  (MAVA), \nResettlement Impact Scoping,   \nPractical Guide to Resettlement Planning and Implementation.    \n\nResettlement Action Plan (RAP).   \nA Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) 8 was entered into in November 2016 between \nthe “Joint-Venture Partners”  and the Ugandan government to set out the principles for land acquisition \nand resettlement of local communities affected by the Tilenga project. The document implemented IFC \nstandards which is more protective of the rights of resettled people than Ugandan law.   \n\nSpecific commitments include:  \n\n i) considering feasible alternative project designs to avoid and minimize physical and economic \ndisplacement  while  balancing  environmental,  social,  and  financial  costs  and  benefits,  paying \nparticular attention to impacts on the poor and vulnerable,   \nii)  when  displacement  cannot  be  avoided,  providing  displaced  communities  compensation \nincluding where appropriate land for land compensation   \niii) engagement with affected communities   \niv) grievance mechanism   \nv) resettlement and livelihood restoration planning and implementation.   \n\nThese standards are detailed in the Resettlement Actions Plans (RAP) which constitute the framework of \nthe resettlement process. A contractor Atacama was appointed by Total to implement the process.   \n\nsocio-economic studies  were  done  using information \n\nsurveys carried  out \nDetailed \nwith households on their current livelihoods, potential impacts on livelihood and recommendations on \nprograms  to  be  undertaken. Consultations  involved  whole  households  and  formed  the  basis  for \nmonitoring and evaluation of the programs which is now ongoing from household to household.   \n\nfrom \n\nThe land acquisition and resettlement process was conducted by Atacama under the supervision of Total \nE&P Uganda and its Partners. Total E&P Uganda,  its partners and the Ugandan government committed in \nthe Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) to offer compensation for loss of assets at full \nreplacement cost and other assistance to help affected person improve or restore their standards of living \nor livelihoods. A resettlement plan and a livelihood restoration program  have been into place offering \n\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\ninter  alia  training  courses  to  affected  communities.  The  measures  during  the  first  phase  of  the \nresettlement  plan  were accounted  for  in  the Resettlement  Action  Plan  (RAP) 1  Report which was \nsubmitted to the Ugandan government for approval and published on Total E&P Uganda's website11.  \n\n The Tilenga Project  is  continuously monitored by  way  of  regular  reporting9 from  Atacama  as  well  as \ninternal and external audits of ground operations in order to ensure compliance with the LARF, IFC and \ninternational Human Rights standards.   \n\nTotal  notes  that  the  FIDH  report  is  both  out  of  date  and  factually  incorrect  on  a  number  of  points. \nExamples include:   \n\nto  outdated  guidelines \n\n•  Reference \nfor \nland acquisition which have since been replaced   \nInaccurate descriptions of  rates  applicable \n• \ncompensation rates do take into account the maturity of plants (tree, crops).  \n\nfor  compensation, \n\ncompensation  and  assessment \n\nfor \n\nfor  example  the \n\nLand Acquisition Agreements  \n\nWith  respect specifically to land  acquisition  agreements,  these have  been signed  by  affected  persons \n(PAPs)12,  their  spouses, and a  translator  to  confirm  that  the  PAP  understood  what  was being signed. \nSignatures took place in the presence of representatives of local community members in order to ensure \ntrue  consent.  Affected  persons who  objected to the  valuation  of  compensation  were  given  the \nopportunity  to  lodge  a  grievance and  were  given  a  copy  of  the  grievance  forms. Audits  conducted by \nexperts have not  revealed any  violations  of  Total’s Code of  conduct  in  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement process.   \n\nAccess to information  \n\nregards \n\nThe report does not reflect the numerous actions undertaken to ensure dialogue with stakeholders of \nthe Projects. As \nincluding \nthe Tilenga Project,  dialogue  with  affected \naffected communities started in 2015 as part of the  Economic and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). In \n2015,  over  900  stakeholders  participated  in  consultations  at  district,  sub-county  and  community \nlevels. During  the  project  design  process  comments  were  logged  in  a  register  for  feedback.  Concerns \nregarding employment  were  addressed  with  a  ballot  system  to  select  unskilled  workers,  and \neducational programs were set up. Between November and December 2016, 51 focus group discussions \nwere held throughout villages for the ESIA. In January 2018, the preliminary findings of the ESIA were \npresented during village meetings with affected communities who provided comments. In total, 10,000 \npeople  were consulted to  produce  the  ESIA.  Before  its  approval,  the  Ugandan  National  Environment \nManagement Authority (NEMA) conducted public hearings on the ESIA in November 2018.   \n\nstakeholders \n\nContinuous dialogue with stakeholders is enshrined in the LARF and the Tilenga Stakeholder Engagement \nPlan which  sets  out  key  principles  for  consultations  of  affected  communities. A  specific Stakeholder \nimplemented.  Consultation  of  affected \nEngagement  Plan for the  resettlement  process was  also \ncommunities  took  place  by  way  of  village  meetings,  focus  group  discussions,  posters  in  public  places, \ninformation leaflets, Q&A sheets, radio and surveys. Project affected persons, communities, civil society, \nlocal and central government were all concerned. Targeted efforts were made for vulnerable groups, and \nfeedback was recorded and integrated into plans for project implementation. A detailed account of the \nstakeholders' engagement actions can be found in RAP 1 Report.   \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nInadequate Redress and its impacts on adequate standard of living  \n\nWhere  it  is  necessary  to  physically  displace  households,  the  affected  persons  may  opt  for  in  kind \ncompensation, in which case their main residence is rebuilt. In phase 1 (RAP 1) this concerned around 30 \nunits (houses). In such cases, particular attention is paid to the choice of land on which the new residence \nwill be constructed.  \n\nAs part of livelihood restoration programs implemented by Total E&P Uganda, it is also important to refer \nto the construction of the  Avogera Health Center in the sub-county of Ngwedo which contributes to the \nimprovement of the network of community health centers in the region,  \n\nIn addition, affected persons are monitored regularly to ensure that they have access to a standard of \nliving at least  equivalent  to  that  which  they  had  initially.  On  a  sample  of  223  affected  persons,  it was \nobserved that: security of title deeds has been increased; the rate of access to health centers managed by \nthe State decreased from 97.3% to 94.2% but increased from 1.7% to 37.2% for access to hospitals and \nprivate clinics; the number of children enrolled in secondary education increased from 10.8% to 20.4% \nand those in academia from 0.2% to 4.2%. \n\nGender Discrimination  \n\nThe Tilenga project  has  a  specific  Gender  Management  Framework  which notably aims  to  address \nmitigation of gender related physical and economic displacement impacts. Measures taken include gender \nspecific meetings and topics, gender mainstreaming in the contract’s requirements, considerations with \nrespect to resettlement and livelihood restorations such as seeking spousal consent for sale of land and \ncompensation payments. \n\nIn relation in particular to land agreements, not only is spousal consent sought, but there are also clear \nprovisions  in  the  forms  related  to  payment  such  as,  the  Land  Survey  Form,  the  property  valuation \nassessment form, the Land Owner Verification and identity, the notice to hand over vacant possession, \nthe  socio  economic  household  survey,  and  the  Acknowledgement  of  Receipt  of  Payment  of  approved \ncompensation. \n\nGrievance Mechanisms   \n\nA concerns and grievance mechanism was set up and communicated to all stakeholders at an early stage \nin the resettlement process. Concerns and grievances can be filed by numerous avenues including email, \ntoll free number, postal address, suggestion boxes available in villages, submission during resettlement \ncommittees' meetings, grievance form with CLO. All concerns and grievances are logged in a database.   \n\nThe procedure implemented within TEPU identifies and handles complaints in a very operational manner, \nto ensure its compliance with the “efficiency criteria” set forth in the United Nations Guidelines. It applies \nin  various  areas  (land,  economic  loss,  employment,  social  behavior  and  cultural  heritage  of  the \ncommunities, environment and health, safety, security, logistics and transport). \n\nThe resolution of a grievance is a 4-step process. Grievances are received, acknowledged and registered \nwithin 24 hours. A response is given when available to close the grievance at the first level. When the \nresolution  proposed  to  the  complainant  is  not  accepted  at  the  first  level,  it  is  escalated  to  levels  2 \n(escalation of grievance for further investigation if level 1 solution is not accepted), 3 (solution requiring \n\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nthe intervention of a third party) and 4 (in the absence of the close out at level 3, potential escalation of \nthe grievance to judicial system). The resolution process involves third parties such as members of the \nResettlement Planning Committee (RPC) and District Resettlement Committee (DIRCO). If no solution is \nfound through dialogue, the grievance may be brought before the Ugandan courts.   \n\nIn order to improve the effectiveness of the grievance mechanism, Total E&P Uganda has also set up a \nmonthly societal  reporting  system  in its  entities,  in  addition  with key performance indicators  (KPIs)  to \nmonitor the implementation and management of these mechanisms.  \n\nOn the basis of the reporting document:   \n\nWithin the framework of the first resettlement action plan (RAP1, TILENGA project), Total E&P Uganda \ncollected 170 complaints between January 15, 2018 and end of 2019. 82% of these complaints were fully \nprocessed  within  an  average  period  of three  months.   87%  of  the  complaints  transmitted  through  the \ngrievance mechanism under RAP1 were resolved at either level 1 or level 2.  \n\nThe grievance mechanisms did not receive any complaints related to pressure on persons affected by the \nproject to accept compensation. The majority of complaints relate to challenges to compensation rates \nand asset valuation by people affected by the project.  \n\nIn December 2019, only one complaint on the qualification of residences under RAP1 forwarded by the \nChairman of the Resettlement Planning Committee (RPC) was not resolved and  it was transferred to a \ncompulsory land acquisition case.  \n\n3.3 The right to an adequate standard of living  \n\nTotal has committed to following IFC Performance Standard 5 to improve or restore the livelihoods and \nstandards of displaced persons. The principle sets out the main objective which is to improve, or restore, \nthe livelihoods and standards of living of displaced persons.15  \n\nTotal finds it unfortunate that the quality of work done in this regard is not recognised in the report.   \n\nA number of factual errors should be corrected:  \nTransitional support  \nContrary  to  the  impression  given  in  the  report,  transitional  support  is  not \na Livelihood Restoration initiative but an interim intervention. Following consultations during the planning \nphase of \nrestoration \nprograms introduced were: enhanced Cassava variety with 100 beneficiaries so far, 42 vegetable garden \nestablished, beekeeping programs which have enabled 10 farmers to harvest 61 litres of honey so far and \nit is learnings from these success rates that the remaining and pending programs are to be adopted.  \n\nagricultural \n\nlivelihood \n\nTilenga \n\nproject \n\nbased \n\nkey \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nHouseholds The report also gives the impression that  there  was  a  requirement to undertake  livelihood \nprograms at community level. This is not the case, the focus of such programs is on individual households. \nHouseholds  are  monitored  closely  to  make  sure  that  livelihoods  are  appropriately  restored  or  are \nimproved.  The  only  households  where  the  programs  have  not  been  deployed  are  the  30 primary \nresidents on  the  land  which has  been  acquired  through  the  RAP  1  process  and who opted  for  in-kind \ncompensation  for  their  houses  (replacement  house).  These  replacement  houses  are  still  under \nconstruction  by  Total  E&P  Uganda’s  contractor.  Subject  to  the  completion  of  the  construction  by  the \ncontractor and certification of these houses by local authorities (District), the objective is to enable the \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nprimary  residents  to  move into  their new  houses  in  the  course  of September or  October  2020.  The \nlivelihood restoration measures will be deployed when the residents will move into the new houses.   \n\nCommunity Approach The Tilenga Social Management Plans cover the community approach as well as the \nnotions of group and collective interventions to ensure access and right to services.  Contrary to livelihood \nrestauration  measures  which  focus  on  specific  households  with  an  individual  approach,  the  Social \nManagement Plans is based on a “community approach” for example, working with groups of farmers, \ngroups of women or groups of youths. \n\nLand for Relocation in Kigwera and Kisamere The report suggests that land relocation and compensation \ngiven  to  the  communities  has  been  insufficient  and  that  the  population  has  been  misinformed  in \nthis regard. This perception does not equate to Total’s understanding, considerable efforts were made to \nensure that affected people were adequately informed during the entire process in line with Total E&P \nUganda’s stakeholder engagement plan. It is also inaccurate to suggest that Total’s choice of replacement \nland for affected peoples was governed by economic concerns. Indeed, the alternative land was a further \ndistance and therefore would have created additional different social concerns.  \n\nDamage  to  House   Total  E&P  Uganda  is  concerned  by the reference  in  the  report to alleged  damage \nto a house located in Kisomere, Ngwedo Subcounty, Buliisa which, it is suggested were caused by heavy \nexplosions related to the project. In 2017 & 2018, Total E&P Uganda conducted some geotechnical and \ngeophysical surveys in the Tilenga area to finalize the design of the facilities, however Total can confirm \nthat no explosives were used.   \n\n3.3.3 Conclusion: allocation of responsibility  \n\nThe report amalgamates responsibility for various alleged violations of the rights to an adequate standard \nof living by the State, and “Joint Venture partners”. No distinction is made between activities carried out \nby the Government and those carried out under the responsibility of each of the Projects concerned. This \namalgamation is  incorrect  and  confusing,  as  it leads  to  insinuations  that Total  may  have  taken  part  in \nhuman rights violations, which Total strongly denies and which is not substantiated.  \n\n3.4 The rights to a healthy environment, water and health  \n\nThe  report  suggests  that  impacts  on  the  health  of  community  members  have  occurred  as  a  result  of \ndecrease in air quality, limitations to clean drinking water and transformation of physical and ecological \nenvironment. This is not the case.  \n\nAn Environmental and Social Impact Assessment 16has been conducted in relation to the Tilenga Project. \n(National \nThe Tilenga ESIA report has  been  prepared in \nEnvironment Act Cap 153 and Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1998), following discussions \nwith the key Ugandan Regulators including NEMA and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development. In \naddition, in relation to environmental and social performance, Total E&P Uganda is committed to meeting \nbest international practice (IFC Performance Standards).  \n\naccordance  with national regulations \n\nThis  ESIA report has  been elaborated by independent  National  Environment  Management  Authority \n(NEMA) registered Environmental Practitioners from AECOM Uganda Limited (AECOM) and Eco & Partner \nConsult, based on numerous studies.  \n\n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nSimilarly, an ESIA has been carried out for the EACOP Project in consultation with relevant authorities and \nstakeholders.  It  has  been  approved  by  the Tanzanian National  Environmental  Management  Council \n(NEMC).  In  Uganda, the  EACOP  ESIA  is  currently  under  review  by  the  NEMA after  an  extensive  public \ndisclosure, hearing and engagement process across all the host districts. NEMA mandated an independent \nreview by the internationally recognized Netherlands Commission for Environmental Assessment (NCEA). \nNCEA experts emphasized the quality of the study. They also highlighted a number of matters on which \nadditional information should be included.  As a result, the ESIA was updated to include:   \n\nclarification of non-technical summary to facilitate understanding by decision-makers;  \n\n• \n•  detailed emissions and analysis including proposed mitigation measures;   \nintegration of the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP);  \n• \nspecific details of management of water resources;  \n• \na detailed analysis of potential impacts on biodiversity including proposed mitigation measures \n• \nand project commitments to ensure net positive gain compared to initial conditions.   \n\nThis information together with comments raised by other key stakeholders throughout the review process \nhave been incorporated into the revised ESIA report which was submitted in February 2019 for further \nconsideration. This process is entirely aligned with the requirements set out in the relevant regulations. \n\nAir pollution Contrary to the suggestion in the report, there is no planned well testing associated with \nthe Tilenga Project drilling campaign.    \n\nFlaring There  will  be  no  routine  flaring, any flaring  from  operational facilities will  be  limited  to non-\nrouting or emergency. \n\nEmissions The design  of  combustion  facilities  (power  generation  and  flaring) complies with applicable \nEmission  Limit  Values  as  well  as  the  Air  Quality  Standards  for  key  pollutants  as  defined  within  IFC \nEnvironment, Health and Safety Guidelines as well as draft national legislative requirements.     \n\nNoise Noise modelling undertaken for the basic engineering design established that the noise limits are \nrespected at the central processing facility as per IFC Guidelines.  \n\nDust control A number of mitigation measures are outlined in the ESIA.  An Emissions and Dust Control \nManagement Plan (EDCP) includes detailed information on measures for the control of emissions and dust \nthat  will  be  adopted  throughout  each  phase  of  execution  (enabling  infrastructure,  construction, \noperations and decommissioning).  \n\nLandscape Management A Landscape Management Plan sets out the mitigation measures to ensure that \nvisual  impacts  from  the  facilities  are  minimized. Further  studies  will  be  undertaken  during  detailed \nengineering to define the detailed requirements.  \n\nHealth The report  quotes  statements from  health  professionals that “the  hospital  records  showed  an \nincreasing  number  of miscarriages from  6  in  2014  to  145  in  2019.  The  hospital  also  documented  an \nincrease in the amount of respiratory diseases in Buliisa, from 2188 cases in 2014 to 4401 in 2019”.  Total \nrefutes  the  suggestion  that  exploration  oil  and  gas  activity  has  had  deleterious  health  impacts  of  this \nfact.  Moreover, \nnature  on \nno exploration operations \nin \nthe area since 2014.  \n\n(seismic  data  acquisition  and/or  drilling) have  been conducted \n\nSuch  allegations  are  unsubstantiated \n\ncommunity. \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSept. 10, 2020 \n\nGroundwater A  borehole  drilling  and  pump  testing  campaign  was  carried  out  in  2018  for  the  project \narea. A Water Abstraction Feasibility study which is currently ongoing to consolidate existing information \non the  groundwater  aquifer,  update  the existing  water  balance  data  for  the  area  (taking into  account \nother  water  users  including  communities)  and  to  define  the  water  abstraction  methodology  for  the \nproject.  Preliminary findings suggest that there is sufficient groundwater available for the Tilenga Project \ndevelopment without causing stress on the aquifer and environment.   \n\nSurface Water With respect to the impact of lake water abstraction activities on the volume of water in \nLake Albert, anticipated volumes of water to be abstracted is likely to have a negligible impact on Lake \nAlbert and the ecosystem it sustains.    \n\nFisheries A Cumulative  Impact  Assessment (CIA) has  been  conducted and  has  identified  Lake  Albert \nfisheries as a valued environmental and social component (VEC) in accordance with the definition outlined \nin the IFC. This shows that stressors on Lake Albert capture fisheries are attributed to the potential for \noverfishing in Lake Albert from project induced in-migration and population growth. This will be addressed \nthrough  the  Influx  management  strategy, Community  Environmental  Conservation  Plan and  the \nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services Action Plan.  \n\nProtected areas and sacred natural sites (wetlands, biodiversity) and displacement of animals from their \nnatural habitats Total fully recognizes the sensitive nature of the Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP) \nand the Murchison Falls-Albert Delta Ramsar site and is committed to applying international best practices \n(in accordance with IFC Performance Standards) in addition to national regulations to manage impacts to \nbiodiversity and ecosystem services.    \n\nNot  only  is  Total  committed  to  ensuring  that  project  activities  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the \ninternationally recognized mitigation hierarchy of avoiding, minimizing, restoring and offsetting residual \nimpacts, but clear commitments have been made to achieve a biodiversity net gain compared to initial \nconditions.  \n\nClimate and Greenhouse Gases  \nTotal  has  set  an  ambition  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  across  the  entire  value  chain  globally,  from \nproduction to final use of the products  Total sell to our customers (scopes 1, 2 and 3). As part of this \nambition,  Total  has notably committed  to  achieving  carbon  neutrality  in  Europe26,  in  line  with  the \nobjectives set by the European Union’s Green Deal. The Group will make the same commitment, together \nwith society, in regions that adopt similar objectives to those in Europe in the future. It is, in any event, \nTotal’s  ambition  to  reduce  by  60%  or  more  the  average  carbon  intensity  of  energy  products  used \nworldwide by its customers by 2050.  \n\nThe Tilenga project has been designed to minimize operational greenhouse gas emissions and flaring will \nbe  minimized  in  line  with  the  Global  Flaring  Reduction  Initiative.  Other  such  design  measures  include \ntechnology, such as nitrogen purge on flare stacks, vapor recovery on tanks and vessels as well as utilizing \nall  produced  gas  to  generate  electricity  to  power  the  main  facilities  as  well  as  the  EACOP  pipeline  in \nUganda. This ensures that GHG emission sources are kept to a minimum.  \n\nAdditional detail on our climate ambition, which was enhanced and updated on 5 May 2020, can be found \nin the latest edition of our Climate report.  \n\n* * * \n\n13"}

We \nrespect the diversity of views and continue to work hard to balance all the needs and wants of the \nmany different stakeholders associated with the project.  \n\nMining has coexisted with public uses in the Oak Flat area for decades. We will continue to seek \nconstructive relations will all tribes who have connections to the project area in order to coexist \ninto the future. We are extremely grateful and are encouraged by the extensive and meaningful \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fparticipation,  and  in  many  cases,  the  direct  and  positive  engagement  of  the  Native  American \ntribes who have participated in the permitting process and dialogue with us so far.   \n\nConsistent with ICMM’s Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining we are committed \nto continued consultation with all 11 Native American Tribes that have historical connection with \nthe land involved in the Resolution Copper project, including the Oak Flat campground, Apache \nLeap  and  other  specific  sites  that  have  been  identified  by  the  tribes  through  tribal  perspective \nreports. The 11 tribes that have historic connection to the area are: Hopi Tribe, Pueblo of Zuni, \nMescalaro  Apache  Tribe,  Yavapai  Apache  Nation,  Yavapai-Prescott  Indian  Tribe,  San  Carlos \nApache Tribe, Tonto Apache Tribe, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, White Mountain Apache Tribe, \nGila River Indian Community, and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. Our commitment \nto engage and listen to the concerns of each of these sovereign tribal nations throughout the life \nof the project was communicated in a letter to each elected leader of the 11 tribes in a December \n23, 2020 (attached).   \n\nThe  US  Forest  Service  consultation  process  regarding  Resolution  Copper  has  been  lengthy, \nrespectful and substantive. The US Forest Service has consulted with Native American Tribes \nmeaningfully and consistently for over 11 years on terms defined by each consulting Tribe for full \ninformation  exchange  and  input  long  before  a  final  decision  is  issued.  A  cultural  heritage \nlandscape  approach  has  been  extensively  applied  over the many  years’ worth of  consultation, \ncoordination  and  collaboration  with  Native  American  Tribes  under  the  National  Environmental \nPolicy  Act  for  the  entire  project  area,  land  exchange  and  all  alternatives.  More  than  150 \narchaeological reports, ethnographic studies and tribal perspective reports have been conducted \nto  review  the  Resolution  Copper  project  in  consultation  with  Native  American  Tribes.  The  11 \nTribes  have  considerably  influenced  activities  resulting  in  the  protection  of  specific  traditional \ncultural  properties,  the  avoidance  of  medicinal  plants,  springs  and  ancestral  sites  for  project \nactivities.  \n\nThe outcome of consultation and collaboration has resulted in the significant mitigation measures \nthat respond to the concerns raised by the public and tribal governments through this process. \nThe  details  of  the  mitigations  or  measures  to  resolve  adverse  effects  to  cultural  heritage  are \ndeveloped  in  direct  response  and  close  collaboration  with  Native  American  Tribes  and  federal \nand state agencies and contained within a Programmatic Agreement.  \n\nOver the course of the mine’s life, we expect to invest approximately $100 million in a range of \nimportant  initiatives  including  cultural  heritage,  education,  youth  program  support,  economic \ndevelopment, environmental mitigation and recreation. The Programmatic Agreement is a starting \npoint  from  which  we  will  continue  to  build  in  consultation  with  the  Tribes  and  other  relevant \nstakeholders.   \n\nIt  is  also  important  to  recognise  the  benefits  that  Resolution  Copper  will  provide,  supplying \nessential raw materials to combat climate change; doubling the acreage in federal ownership in \nArizona  of  lands  with  high  biodiversity  and  heritage  value;  creating  well-paid  jobs  in  Arizona; \npaying taxes to support public services; and commitments to local communities and  consulting \n\nPage 2 of 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fNative American Tribes around cultural heritage preservation, education, economic diversification \nand development, employment, youth and other areas. \n\nThere are still many layers and years of permitting, consultation and final feasibility studies ahead \nof  us. We  have time  to continue the  important  dialogue  on  cultural  heritage  and other  matters \nbefore any final decision to invest in the project is made.  \n\nWe remain committed to ongoing engagement with Native American Tribes to continue shaping \nthe project and deliver initiatives that recognize and protect cultural heritage. Through listening to \ntribal views, we seek to find ways to work together collaboratively in a manner that can provide \nmutual benefit for us all.  \n\nPage 3 of 3"}

BHP recognises the \nResolution Copper project area has cultural significance for Native American Tribes, and their members. We \nappreciate the opportunity to share the information below. \n\nResolution Copper Mining is jointly owned by Rio Tinto (55%) and BHP (45%), managed by Rio Tinto.  \n\nThe publication of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Resolution Copper (the project) \nreferred to in the media article is part of an independent governmental, social and environmental assessment \nand licensing process, led by the US Forest Service under the National Environmental Policy Act. It is one of \nmany steps in a long process towards mine development. Further detail on the FEIS, which was published \non 15 January 2021, can be found on the U.S. Forest Service website here.  \n\nBHP respects that some Native American Tribes and other groups are seeking juridical review of the FEIS \nand the land exchange. \n\nIn relation to the outlook for Resolution Copper, further development of the project will be subject to \nadditional studies, including a detailed feasibility study, and engagement with Tribes and other community \nstakeholders, and will be subject to additional regulatory and government approvals in coming years.  \n\nResolution Copper has publicly stated its commitment to ongoing engagement with Native American Tribes \nand working to seek consent before any decision on the development of the project, consistent with the \nInternational Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining. BHP will \nmonitor and support Resolution Copper’s engagement with Native American Tribes, to fulfill its commitments \nthrough ongoing good faith dialogue.  \n\nBHP funding decisions in relation to further development of the project will be contingent upon the project \nsatisfying both commercial considerations and alignment with our values, policies and practices in relation to \nsocial value and the rights of Indigenous Peoples.  \n\nIn this regard, BHP is committed to operating in a manner consistent with the United Nations Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights and we recognise the traditional rights of Indigenous peoples and \nacknowledge their right to maintain their cultures, identities, traditions and customs. Indigenous peoples are \ncritical partners and stakeholders for BHP. Further information regarding our position and approach can be \nfound in Indigenous peoples | BHP. \n\nWe appreciate our ongoing dialogue with the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre on these \ncritically important matters.

Prodeco does not have a legal title to carry \nout mineral exploitation or any interest in the El Prado land.  \n\nIn 2002, group of families claimed to have been forcibly removed from the El Prado land by \nparamilitaries. These families filed a criminal lawsuit against the head of the paramilitary group that \nordered the displacement and obtained a court order by which the paramilitaries were condemned and \nimprisoned and the National Land Agency (ANT), who was managing the resettlement, was obligated to \neither return El Prado land to these families or, if this was not possible, to compensate these families \nwith the value of their land. Prodeco was not involved in the criminal case.  \n\nThis court ruling was ratified by the Colombian Supreme Court in July 2012 and in 2014, the ANT \naccepted this court ruling. The decision coincided with Prodeco’s active engagement with the Colombian \ngovernment on this matter. \n\nOn several occasions, members from this group of families arbitrarily entered Prodeco’s mining \nconcession, claiming that the ANT violated their rights by not complying with the ruling, as it had \nprovided compensation, but did not provide alternative land. Prodeco raised this with the Colombian \ngovernment and the ANT. Following several requests, a meeting took place in 2019 between the Mayor \nof la Jagua de Ibirico, El Prado representatives and the ANT to review the claims and positions of the \ndifferent parties involved.  \n\nAs a result of the meeting, the community accepted that their lawyer would file an additional claim \nagainst ANT for a judicial confirmation on the legal grounds for the community to receive additional \ncompensation from ANT. Since then, there has been no further protests or blockages from El Prado’s \ncommunity against Prodeco. \n\nProdeco has complied with all its obligations for the families of El Prado and always engaged with them \nin a respectful and constructive manner. Prodeco does not have the legal title to carry out any mining \nexploitation on the El Prado land."}

We appreciate the\nchance to put forward our company perspective on these issues.\n\nThe media allegations stem principally from separate media articles posted by the Australian\nBroadcasting Corporation (ABC) with at least two dating back to 2014 and 2017. These\narticles refer to the following topics:\n\n° Northern Overburden Emplacement Facility (NOEF)\n\n° Northern Territory Government's approval of continued operations at MRM\n° Cultural Heritage & Sacred Sites\n\n° Rehabilitation Security Bond\n\n° Environmental Management and the Independent Monitor.\n\nEach of these issues are addressed in further detail below.\n\nMcArthur River Mine\n\nGlencore's McArthur River Mine (MRM) is located in the remote Roper Gulf region in the\nGulf of Carpentaria approximately 970 kilometres southeast of Darwin. Our mine site is\napproximately 65 kilometres south-west of the township of Borroloola.\n\nSituated on one of the world's largest zinc and lead resources the mine employs 1,000\npeople (22% of the permanent workforce is Indigenous) and contributed over $550 million\nto the Territory economy last year.\n\nMRM includes three key operational domains; the open cut mine, a tailings storage facility\nand the northern overburden emplacement facility (NOEF) where the waste rock is stored -\nas well as the Bing Bong Loading Facility.\n\nMRM provides A$1.3 million every year in funding to the MRM Community Benefits Trust\n(CBT), which is dedicated to the social and economic development of the Gulf region.\n\nSince 2007, the trust has invested almost AS20.5 million into 109 programmes in areas that\ninclude health, education and cultural heritage. It has an independent Board and local\ncommunity form the majority of its Directors, including a representative from each clan or\nlanguage group.\n\nNorthern Overburden Emplacement Facility (NOEF)\n\nGlencore plc\nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O. Box, CH-6341 Baar, Switzerland\nT +41 41 709 20 00 F +41 41 709 30 00 www.glencore.com\nRegistered in Jersey with number 107710\nRegistered address: Queensway House, Hilgrove Street, St Helier, Jersey JE1 1ES\n\n\nWe have acknowledged and addressed concerns around the reclassification of the waste\n\nrock several years ago. In response, we undertook the following actions:\n\n° During the period where there was combustion on the NOEF, MRM established air-\nmonitoring stations across the region, including in Borroloola. There was no\nevidence to suggest that air quality readings were at a level that would adversely\nimpact human health.\n\n° We commissioned external environmental consultants and made changes to the\nwaste rock classification and our waste placement methodology.\n° Following a process of extensive evaluation and consultation, we submitted an\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement to the Northern Territory Government for\nassessment and approval (and was subsequently referred for assessment to the NT\nEnvironment Protection Authority). The EIS included the updated classification and\nemplacement methodology for the waste rock facility.\n\n° This revised classification and placement methodology was approved by the\nNorthern Territory Government and has since been successfully implemented onsite.\n° This new methodology has proved effective. We will continue to review, monitor\n\nand adapt out management measures to ensure our waste rock management is\nsustainable over the long-term.\n\n° On a number of occasions over the past 6 years, the Independent Monitor\n(appointed by NT Government) has noted MRM’s continuous progress in relation to\nmanagement of the NOEF.\n\nNorthern Territory Government's approval of continued operations at MRM\nIn 2017, MRM lodged an environmental impact statement (EIS) to the NT Government for\n\nthe long-term management of waste rock and the ongoing environmental management of\nthe mine site including closure planning. In 2018, the NT Environment Protection Authority\nreleased an assessment report, which supported the proposed approach for continuation of\nmining (subject to conditions), found the McArthur River was healthy, water quality was\ngood, and fish were safe to eat.\n\nIn November 2020, the NT Government approved MRM's Mine Management Plan (MMP),\nwhich enables mining to continue for the next four years.\n\nA comprehensive stakeholder engagement process was undertaken for the EIS involving\naround 566 people consulted during 263 separate consultations. The purpose of the\nconsultation was to inform the public of the scope, potential impacts and mitigation\nmeasures and gather feedback from communities and stakeholders potentially impacted or\nbenefited by the continued operations project.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, we also held town meetings in Borroloola, which were open\nto every member of the community to attend.\n\nA wide and diverse range of stakeholder groups were consulted as part of the EIS process for\nthe mine, including Traditional Owners, Custodians, Gudanji, Yanyuwa, Garrwa, Marra\n(Language groups or clans with which people associate), Government, Business, Interest\nGroup, Gulf Region Resident, Roper Gulf, Local Organisation and NGOs.\n\n\nCultural Heritage & Sacred Sites\n\nWe operate under stringent conditions set down through Northern Territory and Federal\nlegislation as well as conditions of Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority certificates,\ndesigned to protect sacred sites.\n\nMRM complies with the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act and has internal\nprocesses in place to ensure the protection of Sacred Sites.\n\nWe understand our obligation to protect Sacred Sites on our mining lease and take this\nobligation very seriously. MRM consults openly and regularly with Traditional Owners of the\nland on which we operate and the Custodians of Sacred Sites.\n\nWe conduct cultural heritage management training for our workforce so they understand\nthe importance of these sites to local Indigenous people.\n\nWe will continue to engage with the First Nation people in the Territory on the\nenvironmental management of the mine and welcome local Traditional Owner and\nCustodian input on how we can continue to improve cultural heritage management in the\nregion.\n\nOn 25 November 2020, we held the official opening of our permanent office in Borroloola,\nwhich allows local community members to approach us at any time.\n\nRehabilitation Security Bond\nMRWM’s security bond is calculated using Northern Territory Government guidelines. Our\n\ncurrent security bond is set at AS400 million. The purpose of the security is for the payment\nof costs if action needs to be taken by the government to prevent, minimise or rectify\nenvironmental harm caused by mining activities on or off the mining site or for completion\nof rehabilitation.\n\nThe MRM security bond is independently reviewed by a third-party engineering firm, which\ngoes a step further than any other mining operation in the Territory. This figure has been\nreduced from nearly $520 million as a result of 4 years of studies through the EIS process,\nwhich has resulted in an improved methodology for covering the NOEF.\n\nMRM is not a party to the current legal action between Northern Territory Government and\nthe Environmental Defenders Office and the Northern Territory Environment Centre.\n\nEnvironmental Management and the Independent Monitor\n\nMRWM’s environmental performance is subject to Northern Territory and Federal government\noversight and is reviewed on an ongoing basis by an Independent Monitor. The mine has\nbeen subject to a number of Independent Review Boards for the NOEF and tailings storage\nfacility.\n\nWe recognise that mining can have an impact on the environment and we take our\nresponsibility to minimise potential impacts seriously. Our approach is set out in detail in our\nenvironmental impact statement (EIS) and is reflected in our approved mine management\nplan (MMP).\n\nAn Independent Monitor (IM), appointed by the Government, provides an independent\nassessment of MRM's environmental performance. The IM's last report noted substantial\n\n\nimprovements at the site in areas that include waste rock, tailings and groundwater\nmanagement, as well as rehabilitation. Further information can be found on the IM website.\nThe IM is expected to issue its next report covering the period (Apr 2018 to Apr 2020) in\n2021.\n\nWe are committed to operating safe, responsible and environmentally sustainable mining at\n\nall of our operations.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAnna Krutikov\nGroup Head of Sustainable Development"}

Está  sujeita  à \n\nauditoria externa independente – nos termos do TTAC – e, com fundamento no art. 66 do \n\nCódigo Civil, atua sob fiscalização do Ministério Público de Minas Gerais (“MPMG”). \n\nPara executar os programas e realizar atividades, a FUNDAÇÃO adotou, desde sua \n\ninstituição, um modelo inovador de governança multi-participativa, com o envolvimento da \n\nsociedade civil por meio do Conselho Consultivo, que foi concebido para assegurar voz ativa \n\ne  o  direito  de  participação  às  comunidades  impactadas  na  definição  e  no  próprio \n\ndesenvolvimento  dos  programas;  (ii)  de  órgãos  governamentais  por  meio  do  CIF  e  das \n\nCâmaras Técnicas e (iii) da Auditoria Externa e Independente. Constituiu-se, assim, como um \n\nnovo paradigma de instituição para lidar com situações envolvendo desastres humanitários \n\ne ambientais, que demandam soluções para muito além das medidas emergenciais. \n\nEm  25  de  junho  2018,  foi  assinado  entre  os  signatários  do  TTAC,  bem  como  o \n\nMinistério Público Federal, o Ministério Público dos Estados de Minas Gerais e Espírito Santo, \n\na Defensoria Pública da União e a Defensoria Pública dos Estados de Minas Gerais e Espírito \n\nSanto,  com  interveniência-anuência  da  FUNDAÇÃO,  termo  de  ajuste,  o  qual  versa  sobre \n\n4 Não suficiente, a implementação desses programas obedece a diversos princípios e premissas, dentre os quais \nmerecem destaque os seguintes: (1) transparência e engajamento das comunidades impactadas nas ações a \nserem implementadas; (2) a recuperação do meio ambiente, reconstrução da infraestrutura pública afetada e \nações  socioeconômicas  e  indenizatórias  com  vistas  a  minimizar  os  impactos  e  à  sua  integral  reparação;  (3) \nestabelecimento  de  cronogramas  objetivos  para  os  projetos;  (4)  as  ações  a  serem  executadas  devem  ser \nregidas  pela  proporcionalidade  e  eficiência,  definidas  com  base  em  critérios  técnicos  e  científicos  para \navaliação  e  quantificação  dos  impactos;  (5)  contínua  interlocução  e  diálogo  entre  o  CIF,  a  FUNDAÇÃO  e  os \nimpactados;  (6)  a  execução  privada  dos  programas,  sob  a  permanente  fiscalização  do  Poder  Público;  (7) \nperiódica revisão das obrigações; e (8) respeito aos direitos humanos dos indivíduos impactados. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n                                       \n\fquestões  relacionadas  aos  processos  de  governança  e  participação  social,  que  foi \n\nhomologado  em  recente  sessão  solene  realizada  em  08  de  agosto  de  2018  (“TAC \n\nGOVERNANÇA”)5 (anexo 2). \n\nTrata-se de ajuste para otimizar o sistema de governança já existente, previsto pelo \n\nTTAC, a fim de ampliar a participação social e elevando a qualidade do processo de tomada \n\nde  decisão,  para  evitar  atrasos  nos  prazos  para  implementar  programas  e  projetos \n\nconduzidos pela FUNDAÇÃO. \n\nDiante do exposto, fica claro que as atividades da FUNDAÇÃO estão dentro de um \n\nmodelo  de  governança  inédito  no  Brasil.  Às  obrigações  legais,  somam-se  a  diretrizes  de \n\ntransparência,  diálogo  e  de  participação  da  sociedade.  Entende-se  que  essa  é  a  única \n\nmaneira  de  se  construir  soluções  duradouras,  que  atendam  aos  anseios  da  população \n\natingida e que permitam o desenvolvimento e a recuperação das regiões impactadas. Essa \n\ninteração  possibilita  que  as  práticas  sociais  e  ambientais  sejam  debatidas,  definidas, \n\nimplementadas, monitoradas e aprimoradas ao longo do tempo. \n\nII. DIREITOS HUMANOS NA FUNDAÇÃO RENOVA \n\nA Fundação Renova foi criada para reparar, compensar e restaurar os danos causados \n\npelo  rompimento  da  barragem  de  Fundão.  Em  decorrência  desse  desastre,  muitas  áreas \n\nforam atingidas e pessoas e comunidades tiveram seus modos de vida impactados, tendo \n\nsido privadas do exercício e da fruição de direitos fundamentais, como o meio ambiente e o \n\nuso da terra, a moradia, o acesso à água e à alimentação, à educação, às práticas culturais e \n\nreligiosas, às atividades econômicas, pesqueiras e agropecuárias, dentre outros. \n\n5 Termo de Ajustamento de Conduta (TAC Governança) anexo 2. \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                       \n\fNeste sentido, a instituição trabalha na execução de uma série de ações e medidas \n\nnecessárias  à  reparação  das  comunidades  e  dos  municípios  atingidos,  por  meio  de  seus \n\nprogramas  que  são  baseados  em  duas  principais  frentes:  remediação  e  compensação.  A \n\nprimeira consiste em restaurar e restabelecer as comunidades e recursos impactados pelo \n\nrompimento da barragem. Já a frente de compensação visa a substituir ou compensar o que \n\nnão é passível de remediação.  \n\nO  TTAC  possui  uma  linguagem  programática  para  endereçar  a  reparação,  ou  seja, \n\nprevê  a  implementação  de  42  programas  entre  socioeconômicos  e  socioambientais.  Na \n\nliguagem de direitos humanos, tais programas visam a reparar direitos, que são direitos \n\nhumanos,  dentre  eles  o  direito  humano  à  moradia  digna,  a  partir  do  programa  do \n\nreassentamento e reconstrução de vilas, objeto do presente documento. \n\nDe acordo com os Princípios Orientadores da Organização das Nações Unidas sobre \n\nEmpresas e Direitos Humanos (POs, 2010)6, é dever do Estado garantir o respeito (“fulfill”) e \n\nproteger  dos  abusos  contra  os  direitos  humanos  cometidos  por  terceiros,  inclusive  as \n\nempresas; é responsabilidade das empresas (e instituições do 3º setor) respeitar os direitos \n\nhumanos (incluindo sua cadeia de valor); e é dever dos Estados e das empresas (e instituições \n\ndo 3º setor) garantir que vítimas de violações de direitos humanos tenham acesso a medidas \n\nde reparação e remediação apropriadas e efetivas.  \n\nPara garantir este respeito aos direitos humanos, foi prevista na Cláusula 223 do TTAC \n\na elaboração de uma política específica sobre o tema. Mais do que princípios abstratos, a \n\nPolítica  de  Direitos  Humanos  da  Fundação  Renova  (2018)7  prevê  a  adoção  de  ações \n\n6 ONU.

À  Gerência  de \n\nDireitos Humanos (GDH) cabe monitorar a implementação dessas diretrizes no âmbito da \n\natuação da Fundação Renova. Vale destacar ainda os pilares de atuação dessa gerência: \n\ni. \n\nEducação  e  promoção  do  respeito  aos  Direitos  Humanos,  voltados  à  formação  de \n\ncolaboradores  e  terceirizados,  por  meio  de  treinamentos  online  e  presenciais, \n\ndiálogos e palestras, produção de materiais didáticos, realização de campanhas de \n\nsensibilização, dentre outros;  \n\nii. \n\nPrevenção  de  impactos  adversos  aos  Direitos  Humanos  por  meio  de  análises  e \n\nmonitoramento de riscos no âmbito dos programas e áreas da instituição;  \n\niii. \n\nRemediação de casos individuais impactados negativamente ao longo do processo \n\nde reparação. \n\nIII. MARCOS NORMATIVOS DE PROTEÇÃO DO DIREITO HUMANO À MORADIA DIGNA \n\na)  Normas Internacionais \n\nO  direito  humano  a  um  padrão  de  vida  adequado  está  previsto  na  legislação \n\ninternacional de proteção aos direitos humanos desde a Declaração Universal dos Direitos \n\nHumanos (1948). O Pacto Internacional sobre Direitos Econômicos, Sociais e Culturais (1966, \n\nartigo 11.1) prevê a moradia digna como componente desse padrão de vida adequado: “Os \n\nEstados Partes no presente Pacto reconhecem o direito de todas as pessoas a um nível de \n\n8 Diretrizes de Direitos Humanos da Fundação Renova (2020) \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                       \n\fvida suficiente para si e para as suas famílias, incluindo alimentação, vestuário e habitação \n\nsuficientes, bem como a um melhoramento constante das suas condições de existência.9”  \n\nDestacam-se os Comentários Gerais nº 4 e nº 7 do Comitê de Direitos Econômicos, \n\nSociais e Culturais10 a esse artigo 11.1 do Pacto supramencionado.  O Comentário Geral nº 4 \n\nenumera os seguintes componentes do direito humano à moradia adequada: a segurança \n\njurídica da posse; a disponibilidade de serviços, materiais, instalações e infraestrutura; custo \n\nsuportável; habitabilidade; acessibilidade; localização e adequação cultural.  \n\nJá o Comentário Geral nº 7 trata especificamente da questão das remoções forçadas \n\ne prevê que, nos casos em que ela é considerada justificável, deve ser realizada conforme a \n\nlegislação  internacional  dos  direitos  humanos  e  os  princípios  gerais  de  razoabilidade  e \n\nproporcionalidade, não devendo ocasionar indivíduos \"sem-teto\" ou vulneráveis à violação \n\nde  outros  direitos  humanos.  Onde  aqueles  afetados  são  incapazes  para  prover,  por  si \n\nmesmos, o Estado deve tomar todas as medidas apropriadas, de acordo com os recursos \n\ndisponíveis,  para  garantir  uma  adequada  alternativa  habitacional,  reassentamento  ou \n\nacesso à terra produtiva, conforme o caso.  \n\nb)  Normas Nacionais  \n\nA  Constituição  Federal  de  1988  contempla  diversos  dispositivos  que  elencam  o \n\ndireito  à  moradia  no  rol  dos  direitos  fundamentais,  conferindo  a  ele  inviolabilidade  e \n\nproteção jurídica numa dimensão de tutela à dignidade humana do indivíduo (art. 5º, XI). No \n\nart. 6º, o direito à moradia é considerado como direito fundamental no campo dos direitos \n\n9 ONU. Pacto Internacional sobre Direitos Sociais, Econômicos e Culturais (1966).

O art. 182, \n\nda Constituição estabelece como princípios fundamentais da política urbana a função social \n\nda propriedade e as funções sociais da cidade. O art. 183 reconhece o direito à posse para \n\nfins de moradia social por meio da usucapião urbana e da concessão de uso.  \n\nAlém disso, a legislação brasileira trata da proteção ao direito à moradia e à cidade \n\nde maneira significativa em vários textos normativos, especialmente no Estatuto da Cidade \n\n(Lei nº 10.257, de 10 de julho de 2001), dentre outros.  \n\nIV. O PROGRAMA DE REASSENTAMENTO DA FUNDAÇÃO RENOVA  \n\nNo  sentido  de  garantir  o  direito  humano  à  moradia  digna,  conforme  parâmetros \n\nprevistos  na  legislação  internacional  e  nacional,  no  contexto  do  pós  rompimento  da \n\nbarragem de Fundão (2015), a Fundação Renova executa o Programa de Reassentamento, \n\nprevisto  nas  Cláusulas  76  a  78  do  TTAC,  que  estabelece  ações  para  a  recuperação, \n\nreconstrução  e  realocação  das  comunidades  de  Bento  Rodrigues,Paracatu  de  Baixo  e \n\nGesteira. O Programa também atende algumas propriedades rurais no município de Mariana \n\ne Barra Longa, as quais foram consideradas elegíveis. São medidas asseguradas no âmbito \n\ndo Programa de Reassentamento: \n\na)  Disponibilização  de  moradias  temporárias,  dentro  da  necessidade  das  famílias \n\n(número de cômodos/acessibilidade) logo após o rompimento; \n\nb)  Direito  à  informação  e  participação  por  meio  de  comissões  de  moradores  das \n\ncomunidades  impactadas  –  Bento  Rodrigues,  Paracatu  e  Comissão de  área  rural  – \n\npara discussões sobre o processo de reassentamento – que atualmente se reúnem \n\nmensalmente com participação da Fundação Renova e Assessoria Técnica /– Cáritas. \n\nc)  Contratação  de  assessoria  técnica  independente  –  a  Cáritas  Brasileira  –  que \n\nacompanha  as  comunidades  atingidas  nas  discussões  envolvendo  os  programas \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n\fsocioeconômicos  e  socioambientais,  sendo  todas  as  metodologias  de  trabalho \n\nelaboradas pela FUNDAÇÃO validadas pela comissão de moradores e sua respectiva \n\nassessoria técnica e; \n\nd)  Atendimento ao  Padrão  de  Desempenho  05 do IFC/Banco  Mundial  –  aquisição  de \n\nterras  e  Reassentamento  Involuntário,  que  prevê  como  diretrizes:  prever,  evitar e \n\nminimizar  os  impactos  ambientais  e  sociais  adversos  decorrentes  da  aquisição  de \n\nterra  ou  de  restrições  de  uso;  realizar  as  atividades  somente  após  a  divulgação \n\napropriada  de \n\ninformações,  consulta  e  a  participação  das  partes  afetadas; \n\naperfeiçoar ou recuperar os meios de subsistência e os padrões de vida das pessoas \n\ndeslocadas e melhorar as condições de vida dos reassentados. \n\nO  programa  busca  referências  também  nas  recomendações  da  ONU,  por  meio  do \n\nManual de Moradia Adequada11, que propõe a atenção ao direito à moradia nos âmbitos de \n\ninfraestrutura,  privacidade,  acesso  a  serviços  e  segurança  na  medida  em  que  pretende \n\natender a todos os requisitos e a legislação ambiental vigentes com: \n\ni.  Envolvimento dos órgãos ambientais competentes na busca de soluções sustentáveis \n\ne garantia de celeridade nos processos de licenciamento do reassentamento; \n\nii.  Realização, junto à comunidade reassentada, de trabalhos de educação ambiental, \n\ncom  objetivo  de  proporcionar  o  uso  consciente  e  responsável  das  áreas  do \n\nreassentamento e  \n\niii.

Dessa forma, o programa buscou referências \n\nem modelos e na própria legislação, que pudessem referendar o trabalho a ser implantado12. \n\nIV.I.  BREVES  CONSIDERAÇÕES  SOBRE  O  PROCESSO  PARTICIPATIVO  NO \nREASSENTAMENTO \n\n O  processo  de  Reassentamento  das  comunidades  atingidas  pelo  rompimento  da \n\nbarragem de Fundão, desde sua fase inicial, tem como principal premissa a participação ativa \n\ndas comunidades e famílias elegíveis, em seu próprio tempo, em consonância com as boas \n\npráticas e orientações de organismos nacionais e internacionais que versam sobre o tema. \n\nOcorre que os processos de reassentamento em comento, por serem decorrentes de \n\num  desastre,  guardam  muitas  particularidades  e  ineditismos,  que  podem  ser  verificados \n\ndesde a escolha das áreas anfitriãs pelas comunidades atingidas.  \n\nA escolha das áreas anfitriãs para os reassentamentos foi iniciada em janeiro de 2016 \n\ntendo como processo metodológico a realização de diversos encontros com a comunidade \n\nque contou com as seguintes macro etapas: \n\n1.  Discussão  e  definição  de  critérios  que  direcionaram  o  levantamento  de  terrenos \npossíveis para os reassentamentos por meio de assembleias: \n\na) Bento Rodrigues:  \n\nPara Bento Rodrigues, houve organização anterior da comunidade para definição dos \n\ncritérios  a  serem  considerados  para  escolha  do  terreno  em  assembleia  realizada  no  dia \n\n12 São referências do Programa de Reassentamento: (i) Padrão de Desempenho 05 – IFC, Banco Mundial; (ii) \nLei 10.257, Estatuto das Cidades (10/07/2001); (iii) Manual operacional do Banco Mundial para \nreassentamentos, OP 4.12 de DEZ/01 e (iv) Direito a Moradia adequada ONU – SDH 2013. \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n                                       \n\f27/01/16.

Em outubro de 2016 foi lavrada a escritura pública \n\nde  compra e  venda  entre  ArcelorMittal  e  Fundação  Renova,  tendo  como  o  objeto  à área \n\nanfitriã do reassentamento no lugar conhecido como “Lavoura”. \n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fOcorre que a partir de a partir de 20 de novembro de 2016, passou a ser obrigatório \n\no georreferenciamento e certificação junto ao INCRA dos imóveis com mais de 100 hectares \n\npara alteração do registro imobiliário, a exemplo o registro da compra e venda.  \n\nA ArcelorMittal, proprietária da área, não conseguiu obter a anuência de todos os \n\nconfrontantes,  que  alegavam  problemas  nas  delimitações  do  imóvel.  De  modo  que  em \n\ndezembro  de  2016  foram  iniciadas  discussões  acerca  das  formas  alternativas  para  a \n\nefetivação  da  transmissão  da  propriedade.  Tem-se  aqui  um  exemplo  típico  de  problema \n\nfundiário complexo que requer tempo e profissionais altamente especializados.  \n\nAlém disso, o Decreto estadual nº 44.646/200713, do Estado de Minas Gerais,  que \n\nregulamenta a submissão de projetos de loteamentos e desmembramentos de áreas para \n\nfins  urbanos  nos  municípios  mineiros,  impõe  restrições  para  loteamentos  que  possuem \n\nterreno com declividade acima de 47%, o que era o caso do reassentamento de Bento, uma \n\nvez que uma parte pequena do terreno estava nesta condição. Quando da escolha do terreno \n\npela comunidade, a Fundação Renova já havia se comprometido a retificar essa declividade, \n\nmas a norma foi interpretada de forma restritiva. \n\nCom isso, em junho de 2017, foi realizada audiência pública na qual se concluiu pela \n\nnecessidade  de  adequação  do  projeto  urbanístico  em  relação  às  restrições  legais  para \n\nloteamentos  com  áreas  com  declividade  acima  de  47%,  tal  como  previsto  no  decreto \n\nestadual. \n\nSuperado esses e outros desafios no percurso, ao final de 2017 deu-se a aprovação \n\ndo projeto de lei complementar que tornaria a área anfitriã uma área de expansão urbana, \n\n13 MINAS GERAIS.

Tais \n\npremissas  foram  definidas  pelas  partes  (MP,  Comissão  de  Atingidos,  Assessoria  técnica, \n\nempresas e Fundação Renova) e levadas à homologação em juízo. \n\nDepois  disso,  o  traçado  do  parcelamento  foi  arduamente  estudado  na  busca  pela \n\nconciliação da topografia do terreno com o traçado original do distrito atingido, de forma a \n\nguardar  as  relações  de  vizinhanças  e  o  modo  de  vida  da  Comunidade.  Este  processo \n\ndemandou muito tempo, muito superior ao prazo médio de desenvolvimento de um projeto \n\nde parcelamento. \n\nSomente  depois  de  superados  todos  os  entraves  ora  descritos,  foi  possível  a \n\naprovação do projeto conceitual pela comunidade, enquanto se desenrolavam as discussões \n\ncom o Município de Mariana para a publicação dos decretos que declarariam a área anfitriã \n\ncomo de interesse social e de utilidade pública, para fins de desapropriação.  \n\nUm processo de reassentamento com este nível de complexidade e de participação, \n\nenvolvendo  tantos  entes  e  cuja  implantação  se  deu  em  paralelo  à  construção  de  suas \n\npremissas e diretrizes, é inédito, e por mais que a celeridade seja um desejo, ela não pode \n\nser um limitador para a reparação integral do direito à moradia. \n\nComo exemplo desses desafios, podemos citar a premissa estabelecida de estruturar \n\num parcelamento que buscou recompor as relações de vizinhança com base na origem, ao \n\nmesmo tempo atendendo o marco legal e à topografia. \n\n15 \n\n \n \n\fOutro  diferencial  dos  reassentamentos  coletivos  empreendidos  pela  Fundação \n\nRenova está no fato dos projetos das casas serem elaborados e desenvolvidos em conjunto \n\npor arquitetos disponibilizados para cada núcleo familiar. \n\nO compromisso estabelecido visa construir moradias customizadas às famílias e suas \n\ndemandas, por isso o tempo de elaboração do projeto é variável. Da mesma forma, as obras \n\ntambém  demandam  mais  tempo  e  complexidade  de  execução,  pois  cada  moradia  é \n\nexecutada de um modo específico, a fim de manter a adequação ao projeto arquitetônico, à \n\nestrutura e aos acabamentos escolhidos pelas famílias. \n\nEssa metodologia não é um modelo usual em outros projetos de reassentamentoque \n\nadotam  o  desenvolvimento  de  no  máximo  3  tipologias  habitacionais  de  modo  a  garantir \n\nvelocidade de produção de escala, com uniformidade maior e controle construtivo. \n\nb) Paracatu de Baixo \n\nA validação dos critérios se deu em assembleia realizada no dia 25/01/16.

As seguintes etapas foram realizadas durante o período de \n\n2016 a 2018: \n\ni. \n\nAutodelimitação dos terrenos, com base nas áreas de origem, realizada pelas famílias \n\npor meio de oficinas e plantões de atendimento. \n\nii. \n\nLevantamento de expectativas por meio de metodologia participativa que objetivou \n\ncoletar as necessidades e os anseios dos atingidos para subsidiar a elaboração dos \n\nplanos conceituais urbanísticos das novas comunidades.

II. O PROCESSO DE CADASTRAMENTO DAS FAMÍLIAS  \n\nA  metodologia  do  Cadastro  Integrado  foi  desenvolvida  com  a  participação  de \n\nrepresentantes de instituições públicas e demais entidades que compunham as instâncias \n\nde Governança da Fundação Renova, especialmente, aquelas vinculadas à Câmara Técnica \n\nde Organização Social (CTOS). Entre elas, destaca-se o Ministério da Cidadania, órgão gestor \n\ndo Cadastro Único para Programas Sociais do Governo Federal (CadÚnico), o qual gerenciava \n\no cadastro de quase 30 milhões de famílias brasileiras, e servia como base para tomada de \n\ndecisões  e  concessões de  programas  sociais,  como  o  Programa  Bolsa  Família.  O  Cadastro \n\n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fIntegrado foi iniciado em julho de 2016 e se estendeu por toda a bacia Rio Doce com exceção \n\ndo município de Mariana. \n\nMesmo  com  o  embasamento  apresentado  para  construção  da  metodologia  de \n\nCadastro, não houve anuência dos representantes das comunidades atingidas de Mariana, \n\nbem  como  do  Ministério  Público  para  início  do  processo,  uma  vez  que  apresentavam  a \n\nnecessidade  da  avaliação  prévia  da  assessoria  técnica  dos  atingidos  –  Cáritas.  A  partir  de \n\nentão, estabeleceu-se um plano de trabalho iniciado em março de 2017 e que culminou em \n\nreuniões  semanais  entre  técnicos  da  Fundação  Renova,  Cáritas,  famílias  atingidas  e \n\nrepresentante do Ministério Público para rediscussão do processo de cadastramento a partir \n\nde eixos propostos pela Cáritas.  \n\nEsse  processo  de  discussão  se  estendeu  até  o  mês  de  outubro  de  2017,  com  ampla \n\nprodução, troca de materiais técnicos, consensos construídos e um novo instrumental.  \n\nAlém  disso,  por  liberalidade,  a  Caritas  acrescentou  outras  etapas  de  coleta  de \n\ninformações junto às famílias (Cartografia Social e Tomada de Termo), ampliando o processo \n\nde levantamento de informações. Ressalta-se ainda que das quatro etapas do processo de \n\ncadastramento da Cáritas - Aplicação de formulário, Laudo de perdas e danos, Cartografia \n\nSocial e Tomada de termo-, a Fundação Renova, participa apenas das duas primeiras.  \n\nAo  longo  do  processo  de  aplicação  ocorreram  diversas  reuniões  técnicas  a  fim  de \n\najustar  o  andamento  das  etapas  e  a  adequação  do  cronograma  de  aplicação  de \n\nresponsabilidade  da  Cáritas,  tendo  seu  início  em  janeiro  de  2018  e  previsão  inicial  de \n\nconclusão para março de 2019. Essa data foi repactuada para início de 2020 para abarcar \n\nnova listagem (140 núcleo familiares) apresentada pela Cáritas consolidada no ano de 2019, \n\nporém  é  sabido  que  até  o  momento  essas  pessoas  não  tiveram  o  processo  cadastral \n\nconcluído.  Atualmente,  há  negociação  em  curso  para  repactuar  o  prazo  de  conclusão  do \n\ncadastro considerando as solicitações realizadas até 2019. \n\n20 \n\n \n \n\fFundamental destacar os impactos relacionados ao prolongamento do processo de \n\ncadastramento dos atingidos em Mariana, base fundamental para subsidiar o processo de \n\nreparação.  Consequentemente,  o  reassentamento  precisou  utilizar  as \n\ninformações \n\ndisponíveis  por  meio  de  metodologias  alternativas  executadas \n\n(autodelimitação, \n\nlevantamento de expectativas, cadastro emergencial/Defesa Civil). \n\nApós  a  finalização  das  discussões  sobre  o  Cadastro  dos  Atingidos,  e  diante  da \n\ncomplexidade  das  tratativas  ligadas  à  viabilização  do  processo  de  reassentamento  das \n\nfamílias  atingidas,  em  janeiro  de  2018,  a  Renova  apresentou  um  compilado  de  acordos \n\nfirmados  relativos  ao  Reassentamento,  considerando,  inclusive  a  sistematização  das \n\ndiscussões para reformulação do cadastro relacionadas a este tema.  \n\nA partir disso, a Cáritas desenvolveu um conjunto de diretrizes e apresentou à Renova. \n\nO  documento  apresentando  pela  assessoria  foi  analisado  e  discutido  entre  atingidos, \n\nMinistério  Público,  Cáritas  e  Renova  resultando  no  conjunto  de  Diretrizes  Gerais  de \n\nReassentamento  que  determina  as  políticas  de  atendimento  a  serem  praticadas  pela \n\nFundação  Renova  no  processo  de  reparação  do  Direito  à  Moradia.  As  diretrizes  foram \n\nfirmadas em audiências em que as partes interessadas buscaram estabelecer consenso, a \n\npartir de análises e negociações sobre material.  \n\nO  processo  de  discussão  ocorreu  no  ano  de  2018,  sendo  registrado  nas  Atas  de \n\nAudiências dos Autos dos processos 0400.17.004149-7 e 0400.15.004335-6, dos dias 06 de \n\nfevereiro, 27 de março, 07 de julho e 28 de agosto deste ano. \n\nAo todo, foram homologadas 79 diretrizes que abarcam temas como: moradia digna, \n\nsegurança  da  posse,  disponibilidade  de  serviços,  materiais,  instalações  e  infraestrutura, \n\nhabitabilidade, acessibilidade, bem como a retomada das atividades produtivas, dos modos \n\nde vida e o acesso igualitário aos bens coletivos das comunidades. \n\n Durante os meses subsequentes de 2018 e 2019 foram realizadas assembleias do \n\nGrupo de Trabalho - GT Interdisciplinar/Moradia, instituído conforme os termos da ata de \n\n21 \n\n \n \n\faudiência  do  dia  27.03.2018  no  âmbito  da  ACP.  Esses  encontros  contavam  com  a \n\nparticipação  dos  representantes  da  Samarco  Mineração  S.A,  da  Vale  S.A,  da  BHP  Billiton \n\nBrasil  Ltda.,  da  Fundação  Renova,  da  Comissão  de  Atingidos  de  Mariana  (CABF),  da \n\nAssessoria Técnica dos atingidos de Mariana – Cáritas, na presença do Promotor de Justiça \n\n(MPMG), tendo como objetivo acompanhar as ações e a implantação dos reassentamentos \n\ne, especialmente, nesses espaços ocorreram as definições da aplicabilidade metodológica de \n\ndiretrizes acordadas.  \n\nDestaca-se  as  discussões  em  âmbito  público  e  participativo  sobre  o  momento  de \n\nadesão das famílias às modalidades de atendimento, sendo elas: reassentamento coletivo, \n\nfamiliar  e  reconstrução.  Por  liberalidade  da  família,  cabe  ainda  a  reparação  do  direito  à \n\nmoradia por meio do pagamento em pecúnia. \n\nAs discussões sobre o tema avançaram, ficando estabelecido na diretriz de nº 2 de 28 \n\nde agosto de 2018 em que a assinatura do termo de opção de modalidade de reparação ao \n\ndireito  à  moradia  para  famílias  com  direito  ao  reassentamento  coletivo,  “será  após  a \n\naprovação do projeto de construção pelos órgãos municipais competentes”, e que, “a partir \n\nda  assinatura  do  TERMO  DE  OPÇÃO,  o  atingido  dispensa  definitivamente  as  demais \n\nmodalidades de atendimento, não havendo nenhuma limitação de tempo para que a família \n\ntome sua decisão.  \n\nNeste mesmo documento, na diretriz de nº 5, fica também definido que a assinatura \n\ndo termo de opção para atingidos com direito ao reassentamento familiar que o momento \n\npara adesão e assinatura do TERMO DE OPÇÃO será após a conclusão das vistorias do imóvel \n\nescolhido pelo atingido para aquisição. Podendo o atingindo, oriundo dos reassentamentos \n\ncoletivos, retornar a essa modalidade mesmo após ter conhecido diversos imóveis. Destaca-\n\nse ainda que não há restrição no número de imóveis indicados para análise e estudos, nem \n\nlimite  de  prazo  para  escolha  do  imóvel  definitivo  ou  migração  para  outra  modalidade. \n\nImportante conhecer tais aspectos, pois ao disponibilizar a cada família uma ampla escuta \n\n22 \n\n \n \n\fsobre  seus  interesses  e  tomada  de  decisão,  o  prazo  para  cumprimento  da  entrega  dos \n\nreassentamentos se altera. \n\nÉ relevante também pontuar que o instrumento utilizado para comprovação dessas \n\netapas  foi  elaborado  com  a  participação  da  Assessoria  Técnica  dos  atingidos  –  Cáritas  e \n\naprovado em março de 2019 pela 1ª Promotoria de Justiça de Mariana.  \n\nApós  aprovação  do  projeto  urbanístico  do  reassentamento  de  Bento  Rodrigues, \n\nforam  realizadas  discussões  junto  à  comunidade  acerca  do  início  dos  atendimentos  das \n\nfamílias elegíveis para desenvolvimento de seus projetos arquitetônicos individuais. Essas \n\ndiscussões  aconteceram  ao  longo  dos  meses  de  março,  abril  e  maio  de  2018  e,  para  tal, \n\nforam utilizadas as reuniões do GT Interdisciplinar/Moradia assim como reuniões específicas \n\ncom a Comissão de Bento Rodrigues, sempre acompanhado pela sua Assessoria Técnica  – \n\nCáritas e representante do Ministério Público.  \n\nA  metodologia  criada  para  desenvolvimento  dos  projetos  arquitetônicos  das \n\nmoradias  das  famílias  também  contou  com  processo  participativo  e  deliberativo.  Os \n\natendimentos às famílias para projeção das moradias foram iniciados em abril de 2019.  \n\nEsta metodologia estabelece conexão com o modo de vida anterior e a perspectiva \n\nfutura de moradia. Ela também busca habitabilidade necessária para a atual composição do \n\nnúcleo  familiar  que  irá  residir  na  moradia.  Assim,  a  construção  de  cada  casa  considera  o \n\nprojeto elaborado junto a cada família, garantindo as necessidades e a individualidade dos \n\nnúcleos familiares. Esta metodologia foi dividida em 5 fases: \n\nFase 1: Conhecer: nesta fase as famílias criam os laços com os profissionais (analista \n\nsocial  e  o  arquiteto)  que  vão  lhe  atender,  conhecem  o  modelo  de  atendimento, \n\nestabelecem agenda de encontros, entendem o papel do arquiteto e das normativas \n\nnecessárias para garantir a qualidade da edificação. \n\nFase 2: Lembrar: Nesta etapa, as famílias narram ao arquiteto como era a ocupação \n\n23 \n\n \n \n\fdo  espaço  na  área  de  origem  e  através  dela  estabelecem  referência  espacial  e \n\nfuncional para o desenvolvimento da nova moradia.   \n\nFase 3: Criar: Nesta fase as famílias estabelecem sua expectativa de futuro e definem \n\no programa da nova moradia.  \n\nFase 4: Ajustar: nesta fase as famílias ajustam o produto apresentado pelo arquiteto, \n\nfruto da fase anterior.  \n\nFase  5:    Escolher  materiais:  nesta  fase  as  famílias  escolhem  os  materiais  de \n\nacabamento da moradia.  \n\nNeste  processo,  a  Fundação  Renova  sempre  buscou  respeitar  o  tempo  e  a \n\ndisponibilidade que cada núcleo familiar leva para definir seu projeto.  \n\nPara  a  fase  de  construção  das  casas  também  foi  pactuada  metodologia  onde  as \n\nfamílias acompanham a construção das suas casas. Elas visitam as obras nas principais fases \n\nde  execução.  Sempre  que  solicitada  pelas  famílias,  a  Fundação  Renova  organiza  visita \n\nextemporânea  à  obra  e,  mensalmente,  a  Comissão  de  Atingidos  e  sua  assessoria  técnica \n\nCáritas fazem visitas de acompanhamento de obras.   \n\nPara os projetos de uso coletivo, também houve participação das comunidades na \n\ndefinição de cada projeto com mais de 09 reuniões e oficinas. Em Bento Rodrigues foram \n\nrealizados 05 encontros e em Paracatu realizados 04 encontros. Destaca-se que foram várias \n\nas instâncias em que os bens coletivos foram ou ainda estão sendo discutidos. São elas: rodas \n\nde conversa, reuniões com órgãos públicos (Secretaria de Educação e Secretaria de Saúde), \n\nencontros informativos, fóruns de Grupo de Trabalho GT's e reuniões com a Arquidiocese. \n\nEscola, parques ecológicos, áreas verdes, praças, posto de saúde e serviços, sedes de \n\nassociações,  sítios  arqueológicos,  cemitérios  e  as  áreas  de  lazer  e  esporte  foram \n\ndesenvolvidos  em  metodologia  específica,  com  participação  da  comunidade  e  os  entes \n\npúblicos responsáveis pelo funcionamento destes equipamentos.  \n\n24 \n\n \n \n\fA  modalidade  de  Reassentamento  Familiar,  por  sua  vez,  é  disponibilizada  para \n\natendimento  daquelas  famílias  antes  vinculadas  aos  reassentamentos  coletivos  e  que \n\noptaram  por  essa  modalidade  de  atendimento,  bem  como  aquelas  famílias  oriundas  de \n\npropriedades rurais atingidas. Nesta modalidade de atendimento, as famílias são apoiadas \n\nna busca e aquisição de imóveis disponíveis no mercado imobiliário. \n\nEm atendimento ao determinado no TTAC e no conjunto de Diretrizes, foram definidos \n\nos procedimentos para operacionalização do Reassentamento Familiar pela Fundação Renova, \n\nos  quais  foram  apresentados  e  validados  nas  instâncias  participativas  de  discussão  com \n\nMinistério Público, Comissão de Atingidos, comunidades atingidas e sua Assessoria Técnica – \n\nCáritas.  \n\nAs atividades contidas nesta modalidade de reparação compreendem o período no \n\nqual as famílias serão acompanhadas pela equipe técnica na busca de um imóvel. As fases \n\nde acompanhamento às famílias no Reassentamento Familiar incluem:  \n\n \n\nreunião de apresentação da modalidade;  \n\n  apresentação de banco de imóveis, a partir do qual a família pode indicar imóveis de \n\ninteresse contidos no banco ou mesmo trazidos pela própria família, de acordo com \n\nseu atendimento devido;  \n\n  vistorias e estudos técnicos (habitabilidade, aptidão produtiva, pericial e avaliação \n\nimobiliária) do imóvel escolhido, coleta de documentação preliminar e elaboração \n\ndos Cadernos Imobiliários; \n\n  aprovação pela família do Caderno Imobiliário que traz os estudos da propriedade \n\nescolhida; \n\n  negociação do imóvel pela Renova; \n\n  adesão definitiva da família a essa  modalidade de atendimento após conclusão de \n\nacordo comercial; \n\n25 \n\n \n \n\f  aquisição do imóvel e transferência de titularidade ao atingido; \n\n  encontros com as famílias para elaboração dos projetos arquitetônicos individuais de \n\nconstrução e/ou reforma dos imóveis adquiridos; \n\n  processo de emissão de licenças e alvarás para obra; \n\n \n\nrealização de obras e acompanhamento pelas famílias; \n\n  entrega do imóvel às famílias e planejamento de mudança em até 3 meses após a \n\nentrega, conforme desejo da família. \n\nEste  processo,  até  culminar  com  a  aquisição  do  imóvel,  possui  duas  variáveis \n\ntemporais determinantes: a resolução da família quanto ao imóvel escolhido e a situação de \n\nregularização fundiária do imóvel. Em ambos os casos, não há governabilidade por parte da \n\nFundação Renova. \n\nConsiderando  a  modalidade  de  reconstrução  na  qual  a  família  opta  pela \n\npermanência  na  área  de  origem,  conforme  também  previsto  em  diretrizes,  deve  ser \n\ngarantido a viabilidade técnica do imóvel e este deve ser reconstruído de forma que volte à \n\ncondição similar ou melhor que o imóvel na situação anterior ao rompimento da Barragem \n\nde Fundão.  \n\nDentre  estas  etapas,  destaca-se  a  implementação  do  Plano  de  Adequação \n\nSocioeconômico  Ambiental \n\n(Pasea)  que  prevê  ações  tanto  reparatórias  quanto \n\ncompensatórias divididas da seguinte forma: \n\na.  adequação ambiental das propriedades; \n\nb.  recuperação e incentivo à produção agropecuária; \n\nc.  Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural (ATER); \n\nd.  reforma, reconstrução e nova construção de estruturas rurais. \n\n26 \n\n \n \n \n\fIV. III. REASSENTAMENTO COLETIVO DE BENTO RODRIGUES \n\nO  reassentamento  coletivo  de  Bento  Rodrigues  possui  95%  das  obras  de \n\ninfraestrutura concluídas, considerando vias, drenagem, energia elétrica e esgoto das ruas. \n\nHouve também a conclusão das obras da estação de tratamento de esgoto, da ponte Sagrado \n\nCoração de Jesus, assim como do Posto de Saúde, Posto de Serviços e da Escola Municipal.  \n\nNo  que  se  refere  às  obras  de  edificações  particulares,  foram  concluídas  7  (sete) \n\ncasas e 72 (setenta e duas) casas se encontram em construção. No total foram emitidos \n\n114  (cento  e  quatorze)  alvarás  para  casas  e  18  (dezoito)  licenças  para  lotes  vagos  e  04 \n\nalvarás para bens públicos. \n\nDos demais bens de uso público e/ou coletivo, a Fundação Renova possui alvará para \n\nobras da Igreja Assembleia de Deus. O projeto do Cemitério já se encontra protocolado e \n\naguarda  emissão  de  alvará,  e  outros  equipamentos  coletivos  estão  em  fase  de \n\ndesenvolvimento de projeto junto às entidades responsáveis, sendo eles: a Igreja São Bento \n\ne  Igreja  das  Mercês  (Arquidiocese  de  Mariana),  sede  da  AHOBERO  –  Associação  de \n\nHortifrutigranjeiros de Bento Rodrigues, Quadra Poliesportiva e o Campo de Futebol, Sítio \n\narqueológico,  Parque  da  comunidade, Praça  do encontro,  Parque  Linear,  Salão Paroquial, \n\nPraça Central. \n\nIV. IV. REASSENTAMENTO COLETIVO DE PARACATU DE BAIXO \n\nEm Paracatu de Baixo, 6 (seis) casas se encontram com obras iniciadas. A montagem \n\nda escola, assim como vias de acesso à comunidade e às áreas dos lotes estão em fase de \n\nterraplanagem. As contenções dos lotes, obras de bueiros de drenagem pluvial, adutora de \n\nágua tratada e rede de esgoto também se encontram em andamento. Mais de 60 projetos \n\nconceituais das casas foram concluídos.  \n\n27 \n\n \n \n \n\fEm relação aos bens coletivos, a Escola (infantil e de ensino fundamental), o Posto \n\nAvançado de Saúde e Posto de Serviços se encontram com alvará emitido. O Cemitério e o \n\nCampo  de  Futebol  se  encontram  protocolados  e  aguardam  emissão  de  alvará.  O  Salão \n\nComunitário,  a  Igreja  Católica  e  a  Casa  São  Vicente  de  Paula  encontram-se  em  fase  de \n\ndesenvolvimento de projeto junto à Arquidiocese de Mariana.  \n\nIV.V. REASSENTAMENTO FAMILIAR \n\nConsiderando  que  o  processo  de  migração  das  famílias  para  o  reassentamento \n\nfamiliar poderá ocorrer até a assinatura do termo de opção, ressalta-se que o universo de \n\nfamílias e atendimentos está em constante variação.  \n\nNo momento, tem-se 144 famílias optantes pela modalidade de Reassentamento \n\nFamiliar, sendo que, destas, 57 tiveram seus imóveis adquiridos.   \n\nIV.VI. RECONSTRUÇÃO \n\nNo que diz respeito à reconstrução, temos 13 famílias em atendimento, das quais 10 \n\nfamílias  com  casas  concluídas  e  entregues  e  as  demais  em  atendimento,  com  projetos \n\nconceituais aprovados e liberados para obra. \n\nMais  informações  sobre  o  andamento  das  obras  e  entregas  dos  reassentamentos \n\npodem ser consultadas no endereço:  \n\nhttps://www.fundacaorenova.org/dadosdareparacao/reassentamento-e-infraestrutura/ \n\nIV.VII. ATENDIMENTO EM MORADIAS TRANSITÓRIAS  \n\nAtualmente, a Fundação Renova realiza atendimentos temporários relacionados a \n\nmoradia  de  famílias  elegíveis  ao  reassentamento  por  ocasião  do  deslocamento.  Este \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fatendimento temporário é disponibilizado por meio de pagamento de aluguel de imóvel de \n\nescolha  da  família  ou  transferência  de  recurso  financeiro  direto  ao  atingido,  sendo  de \n\nliberalidade de cada núcleo familiar a escolha pelo formato de atendimento.  \n\nO  atendimento  temporário  prevê  também  pagamento  da  diferença  de  tarifa  de \n\nenergia elétrica considerando diferença dos custos rurais x urbanos, além de pagamentos de \n\nvalores relacionados à IPTU e a tarifa de água. Cabe a Fundação Renova também garantir a \n\nhabitabilidade das famílias por meio de oferta de mobília e eletrodomésticos, bem como a \n\nadequações/melhorias nas moradias transitórias.  \n\nFaz parte do suporte às famílias na escolha do imóvel para moradia temporária, a \n\nrealização de laudos cautelares e a comunicação a respeito sobre localização do imóvel em \n\náreas  de  risco,  com  base  em  informações  oficiais  da  Prefeitura  Municipal.  Também  é \n\nrealizada pesquisa de avaliação anual para mapeamento de oportunidades de melhoria do \n\natendimento  da  moradia  temporária,  atividade  essa  que  está  temporariamente  suspensa \n\ndevido a pandemia COVID.  \n\nV. MECANISMOS DE ESCUTA E RECLAMAÇÃO (CANAIS DE RELACIONAMENTO) \n\nÀ luz dos Princípios Orientadores sobre Empresas e Direitos Humanos (2010), também \n\nextensíveis a entidades do terceiro setor tais como a Fundação Renova, a instituição  tem \n\ncomo premissa atuar de forma dialogada com as partes interessadas para construção das \n\nsoluções  que  envolvem  o  processo  de  reparação.  Para  tal,  disponibilizada  os  seguintes \n\nmecanismos de escuta e espaços de diálogo: \n\n  Escutas  semanais:  espaço  de  diálogo  para  atendimento  às  famílias  elegíveis  ao \n\nReassentamento  para  tratativas  diversas  do  processo.  Os  encontros  ocorrem  com \n\nparticipação da Assessoria Técnica dos atingidos – Cáritas, salvo em casos em que a \n\nfamília expressamente opta pela não participação. \n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n\f  Envio da agenda semanal: agenda com todas as atividades do processo reparação \n\nrealizadas em Mariana, incluindo as tratativas relacionadas às famílias elegíveis aos \n\nreassentamentos  de  Bento  Rodrigues,  Paracatu  de  Baixo  e  propriedades  rurais.  A \n\nagenda é enviada à Comissão de Atingidos, Assessoria Técnica – Cáritas e Ministério \n\nPúblico. \n\n  Ouvidoria:  A  Ouvidoria  é  o  canal  da  Fundação  Renova  para  receber,  registrar  e \n\ninvestigar  denúncias  e  reclamações  relacionadas  às  comunidades  atingidas  pelo \n\nrompimento  da  barragem  de  Fundão,  em  Mariana  (MG).  Essas  manifestações  são \n\ntratadas pela área de Ouvidoria da Fundação Renova.  \n\nE-mail: ouvidoria@fundacaorenova.org \n\nTelefone: 0800 721 0717  \n\n  Canal  confidencial:  O  Canal  Confidencial  recebe  relatos  sobre  temas  corporativos, \n\nrelacionados  ao  descumprimento  do  código  de  conduta,  normas  internas  ou \n\nlegislação  vigente  por  parte  dos  nossos  colaboradores,  terceiros  contratados  ou \n\nsubcontratados. Todos os relatos recebidos no Canal Confidencial são tratados pela \n\nárea de Compliance da Fundação Renova. \n\nE-mail: canalconfidencial@fundacaorenova.org \n\n  Fale Conosco: Canais de Relacionamento para o esclarecimento de dúvidas, registro \n\nde  sugestões  e  demandas  das  comunidades  impactadas  pelo  rompimento  da \n\nbarragem de Fundão. \n\nTelefones: 0800 031 2303/0800 200 7302 \n\n30 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fE-mail: https://www.fundacaorenova.org/fale-conosco/ \n\nPostos  de  atendimento:  Casa  do  Jardim  –  Praça  Gomes  Freire.

PROCESSO DE LICENCIAMENTO E EMISSÃO DE ALVARÁS  \n\nDe acordo com cláusula 196 do TTAC, “os ÓRGÃOS AMBIENTAIS deverão agilizar as \n\nanálises dos processos que envolvam atos vinculados aos PROGRAMAS SOCIOAMBIENTAIS \n\ne SOCIOECONÔMICOS.” \n\nDesta  maneira,  o  desenvolvimento  dos  estudos  ambientais  e  a  estruturação  das \n\ndocumentações de engenharia que compuseram os processos de licenciamento contaram \n\ncom  a  discussão  e  análise  prévia  dos  órgãos  licenciadores  estaduais  e  municipais.  Assim, \n\nquando do efetivo protocolo dos estudos e documentações, estes já eram de conhecimento \n\ndos órgãos licenciadores.  \n\nPara a implantação das moradias, também é necessário obtenção de autorização por \n\nmeio de alvarás individuais do projeto de cada família, conforme legislação municipal. \n\nPara obtenção deste alvará na Prefeitura de Mariana, o tempo decorrido é variável, \n\ne,  tão  somente  após  a  emissão  desse  alvará  é  possível  iniciar  as  obras  de  construção  da \n\nmoradia. \n\nVII. MOTIVOS DE ATRASOS ALHEIOS À ATUAÇÃO DA FUNDAÇÃO RENOVA  \n\nInicialmente,  com  o  intuito  de  sintetizar  o  cronograma  dos  reassentamentos  de \n\nMariana, colaciona-se o infográfico a seguir, para melhor visualização: \n\n31 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fCabe  esclarecer  que  inúmeros  fatores  alheios  à  atuação  da  Fundação  Renova \n\nconcorreram para o cumprimento parcial do prazo para entrega dos reassentamentos. \n\nAlém  dos \n\nfatores  que \n\ninvariavelmente \n\ninterferem  no  andamento  dos \n\nreassentamentos, como (i) emissão do Documento Autorizativo para Intervenção Ambiental \n\n(“DAIA”)  de  Paracatu  de  Baixo  pela  SEMAD  somente  em  18.6.2019,  (ii)  pendência  de \n\nconclusão do processo de cadastramento conduzido pela assessoria técnica dos atingidos, \n\n(iii) pendência de definição sobre as compensações das moradias previstas em diretrizes de \n\nreassentamento,  (iv)  possibilidade  de  readequação  e  destinação  de \n\nlotes  vagos \n\nindefinidamente,  (v)  variação  das  condições  climáticas,  (vi)  impactos  das  diretrizes  de \n\nreassentamento,  que  demandam  a  participação  ativa  dos  atingidos  nos  projetos  das \n\n32 \n\n \n \n \n\fresidências, bem como atuação dos órgãos municipais para emissão das licenças necessárias, \n\nreforçando a individualização da entrega de cada moradia como exposto detalhadamente \n\nno  item  V,  também  não  se  ignora  (vii)  necessidade  de  obtenção  de  novo  licenciamento \n\nambiental para construção da ETE em local diverso do projeto original, (viii) interrupção das \n\nobras e redução de contingente de colaboradores nas obras em razão das regras sanitárias \n\nsobrevindas com a pandemia. \n\nMuito  embora,  invariavelmente  ocorre  imputação  de  integral  responsabilidade  do \n\natraso à Fundação Renova, são desconsiderados fatores externos totalmente alheios à sua \n\ncapacidade de controle e resposta, a exemplo da pandemia, entre outras externalidades que \n\ninfluenciam diretamente para o não atendimento completo dos prazos fixados para entrega \n\ndos reassentamentos, impactando na velocidade do avanço das obras. \n\nNão  seria  adequado  admitir  que  recaia  unilateralmente  à  Fundação  Renova  a \n\nresponsabilidade por todos os atrasos, sem considerar os fatores externos, inesperados e \n\nalheios à sua atuação, imputáveis a terceiros ou decorrentes de caso fortuito ou de força \n\nmaior, como no caso da pandemia do Coronavírus.  \n\nAinda  que  se  analise  os  fatos  da  forma  mais  objetiva  possível,  as  obras  foram \n\nliteralmente  suspensas  por  3  meses  em  razão  (i)  da  necessidade  de  reorganização  do \n\ncontingente  de  funcionários,  das  estruturas  e  da  logística  das  obras  em  decorrência  da \n\npandemia,  e,  posteriormente,  (ii)  de  atos  ilegais  promovidos  pelo  Município  (como \n\ndestacado especificamente em capítulo próximo). Além disso, há impactos que devem ser \n\napurados,  como  (iii)  a  diminuição  da  velocidade  das  obras  em  razão  da  redução  do \n\ncontingente  efetivo  para  1/3  da  mão-de-obra,  o  que,  estima-se,  impactou  em  240  dias  a \n\nconclusão  dos  reassentamentos,  bem  como  (iv)  as  problemáticas  envolvendo  projetos \n\ninterrompidos pelos atingidos e pendências na emissão de alvarás pela Prefeitura Municipal. \n\n33 \n\n \n \n\fComo  demonstrado  no  infográfico  acima,  para  além  de  todos  os  desafios  que  se \n\nimpuseram para o início das obras dos reassentamentos, desde a escolha das áreas anfitriãs, \n\nno  caso dos  reassentamentos  coletivos  mais  recentemente  as  obras foram  interrompidas \n\npelo período de aproximadamente 3 meses - de 21.3.2020 a 4.5.2020 e, posteriormente, de \n\n21.5.2020 a 15.6.2020 -, em razão da necessária adequação das estruturas e do contingente \n\nde  funcionários  e,  posteriormente,  em  decorrência  de  atos  manifestamente  ilegais \n\npraticados pelo Município de Mariana no contexto da pandemia da Covid-19.  \n\nConsidere-se,  ainda,  que  tais  determinações  impostas  pelo  Município  não  são \n\nmedidas isoladas ou pontuais. O Município continua a determinar medidas restritivas e até \n\nmesmo a paralisação das atividades nos reassentamentos: em  15.3.2021 o Comitê Gestor \n\ndo Plano de Prevenção e Contingenciamento em Saúde encaminhou o Ofício nº14-2021/CG-\n\nCOVID-19  à  Fundação  Renova,  com  determinação  de  paralisação  dos  atendimentos \n\npresenciais dos atingidos. Já em  23.3.2021 encaminhou o Ofício nº 17-2021/CG-COVID19, \n\ncom expressa determinação de imediata paralisação das atividades do reassentamento do \n\nNovo Bento, Paracatu e construção de casas na cidade. Ou seja, mais uma vez, a Fundação \n\nRenova se viu compelida pelo Poder Público à paralisação das obras de reassentamento. \n\nBuscando minimizar os impactos e as consequências da pandemia que há mais de um \n\nano  assola  o  país,  a  Fundação  precisou  tomar  a  difícil  decisão  de  paralisar  as  obras  dos \n\nreassentamentos  a  partir  de  21.3.2020  para  que  as  ações  preventivas  pertinentes  e  o \n\ncontingente de funcionários pudessem ser reorganizados. Embora a continuidade das obras \n\ncivis estivesse autorizada pelo Governo Estadual no meio urbano, os reassentamentos de \n\nBento Rodrigues e de Paracatu de Baixo possuem porte de significante magnitude na região \n\nde Mariana e seus impactos precisam ser considerados. \n\nTrata-se  da  construção  de  infraestrutura  pública  e  de  centenas  de  residências \n\nfamiliares  de  duas  comunidades,  cujas  obras  demandam  relevante  estrutura,  como  o \n\n34 \n\n \n \n\frefeitório dos funcionários, o transporte coletivo, o alojamento, além da inevitável circulação \n\nde  um  número  significativo  de  pessoas  em  um  município  que  se  estima  possuir  61.288 \n\nhabitantes. \n\nAté março de 2020 as obras do reassentamento de Bento Rodrigues contavam com \n\n2.377 colaboradores, enquanto as obras do reassentamento de Paracatu de Baixo contavam \n\ncom  1.098  colaboradores,  ou  seja,  um  total  de  3.475  colaboradores.  O  transporte  de \n\nfuncionários era realizado com capacidade máxima de 44 pessoas e estima-se que 30% do \n\nefetivo  à  época  utilizava  os  alojamentos  (1.043  colaboradores).  O  contingente  de \n\nfuncionários,  somado  à  atuação  de  empresas  terceirizadas,  circulação,  transporte  e \n\nalojamento  de  pessoas,  poderia  ser  a  fórmula  perfeita  para  que,  cedo  ou  tarde,  graves \n\nproblemas  surgissem  em  razão  da  disseminação  do  Coronavírus.  Por  essa  razão,  com  o \n\nintuito de preservar a saúde e a segurança dos colaboradores e dos habitantes do Município \n\nem  um  cenário  de  extrema  insegurança,  foi  necessário  paralisar  as  obras  para  que  os \n\ntrabalhos pudessem ser reorganizados.  \n\nDestaque-se  que  essa  não  foi  uma  ação  isolada  da  Fundação  Renova,  foi  uma \n\nnecessidade e um ato de responsabilidade diante da realidade vivenciada no início de 2020 \n\ne de poucas informações que à época se tinha sobre a crise sanitária que se instaurava e, \n\ninfelizmente,  permanece  pungente  até  os  dias  atuais.  Até  mesmo  o  Poder  Judiciário  e  o \n\nMinistério Público – entidades que prestam serviços essenciais – tiveram de se readequar \n\npara formas de trabalho remota, inclusive com a suspensão de prazos processuais durante \n\no ano de 2020 até que se possibilitasse a reformulação da forma de trabalho. \n\nDiante de uma obra de grande porte, paralisar temporariamente para reorganizar o \n\nfluxo  de  funcionários  representa  um  ato  necessário,  de  responsabilidade  para  proteger  a \n\npopulação e os funcionários. \n\n35 \n\n \n \n\fAlém  disso,  o  Município  de  Mariana  exigiu,  por  meio  do  Decreto  nº  10.071/2020, \n\ndatado  de  30.4.2020,  a  apresentação  de  Plano  de  Ação  aos  responsáveis  pelo \n\ndesenvolvimento  de  atividades  econômicas,  serviços  em  geral,  e  até  mesmo  serviços \n\nessenciais  prestados  no  Município,  conforme  plano  estratégico  municipal  para  retomada \n\ngradual  das  atividades  econômicas.  O  Plano  de  Ação  foi  devidamente  submetido  pela \n\nFundação  Renova  e  aprovado  pela  Comissão  Municipal  de  Assuntos  Ligados  à  Fundação \n\nRenova (“COMAR”) em 4.5.2020. \n\nNão obstante todas as exigências do Decreto nº 10.071/2020 tivessem sido atendidas \n\nno Plano de Ação apresentado pela Fundação Renova, e muito embora as obras civis não \n\ntivessem sido impedidas de forma geral pelo Governo Estadual, o Município simplesmente \n\nobstou o acesso dos colaboradores às obras dos reassentamentos e exigiu a apresentação \n\nde Plano de Prevenção de Contingenciamento, sequer previsto em qualquer ato do Poder \n\nPúblico. Ou seja, se por um lado o Governo Estadual permitiu a continuidade de obras de \n\nengenharia civil, de outro o Município de Mariana impôs medidas muito mais restritivas e \n\nespecíficas à Fundação Renova.  \n\nAdemais, o Município condicionou a retomada dos reassentamentos à recuperação \n\nda rodovia que dá acesso ao Novo Bento e à concordância da destinação de recursos para \n\nexecução das obras de abastecimento e reservatório de água do referido loteamento. Todos \n\nos empecilhos e condicionantes, sem sombra de dúvidas, ilegais, impostos pelo Município, \n\nculminaram  na  retomada  das  obras  somente  em  15.6.2020.  Portanto,  foram  86  dias  de \n\nparalisação total das obras em razão do ato do Município. \n\nPor  essa  razão,  o  contingente  efetivo  de  colaboradores  nas  obras  teve  que  ser \n\nreduzido  em  razão  das  regras  sanitárias  que  impõem  o  distanciamento  social  e,  por \n\nconseguinte,  de  restrições  de  circulação  e  permanência  em  refeitórios,  alojamentos, \n\ntransporte,  entre  outros.  No  Novo  Bento,  o  contingente  foi  reduzido  para  1.051 \n\n36 \n\n \n \n\fcolaboradores  e  no  Novo  Paracatu,  para  537  colaboradores,  ou  seja,  um  total  de  1.588 \n\ncolaboradores  dos  3.475  colaboradores  mobilizados  inicialmente  (menos  da  metade, \n\nportanto). \n\nNão somente a paralisação das obras pelo período de 03 meses impactou a conclusão \n\ndos reassentamentos, como a nova realidade de redução do contingente de colaboradores \n\ncontribui  para  a  diminuição  do  ritmo  e  avanço  das  obras,  em  comparação  ao  período \n\nanterior à pandemia com outras expectativas. \n\nE  para  que  não  pairem  dúvidas  acerca  das  reiteradas  imposições  do  Município, \n\ncumpre  salientar  que  em15.3.2021  o  Comitê  Gestor  do  Plano  de  Prevenção  e \n\nContingenciamento  em  Saúde  encaminhou  o  Ofício  nº14-2021/CG-COVID19  à  Fundação \n\nRenova, com determinação de paralisação dos atendimentos presenciais dos atingidos. Em \n\nseguida,  23.3.2021,  encaminhou  o  Ofício  nº17-2021/CG-COVID19,  com  expressa \n\ndeterminação  de  imediata paralisação das  atividades do  reassentamento  do  Novo  Bento, \n\nParacatu e construção de casas na cidade, até a data de 31 de março de 2021.  \n\nDeve-se  ter  em  mente  que  a  suspensão  de  atendimentos  aos  atingidos  impacta \n\ndiretamente  no  desenvolvimento  dos  reassentamentos:  a  participação  da  comunidade \n\natingida é necessária para a aprovação de todos os projetos e etapas do reassentamento. \n\nAlém disso, embora a Fundação Renova tenha respondido ao Ofício nº 17-2021/CG-COVID19 \n\nposicionando-se  contrária  ao  ali  determinado,  a  imposição  de  paralisação  das  obras  dos \n\nreassentamentos por evidente impacta em atrasos na sua entrega.  \n\nOutro  ponto  específico  que  merece  destaque  relaciona-se  com  a  mudança  de \n\nlocalização da ETE da Bento. Apesar dos alertas da Fundação Renova quanto aos prováveis \n\natrasos  que  decorreriam  da  alteração  do  local  da  ETE  do  Novo  Bento  Rodrigues,  para \n\natendimento da solicitação dos atingidos, sobretudo devido à provável necessidade de novo \n\nprocesso de licenciamento ambiental para execução de obras em área não abarcada pelas \n\n37 \n\n \n \n\flicenças  previamente  obtidas;  os  próprios  atingidos  tomaram  a  decisão  de  alterar  a \n\nlocalização da ETE baseados na promessa de representantes da Secretaria de Estado de Meio \n\nAmbiente e  Desenvolvimento  Sustentável  (“SEMAD”) de que um novo  licenciamento não \n\nseria necessário e que eventuais ajustes burocráticos seriam simples e céleres. \n\nApós  a  elaboração  de  novo  projeto  pela  Fundação  Renova,  em  14.10.2019  foi \n\nrealizada reunião com a SUPPRI para apresentação do mapa de uso do solo da nova área da \n\nETE, ocasião em que o referido órgão confirmou que procedimento seria concluído por meio \n\nde  adendo  à  Avaliação  de  Impacto  Ambiental.  Assim,  logo  em  25.10.2019,  a  Fundação \n\nRenova providenciou o protocolo do pedido de adendo ao AIA, mediante apresentação da \n\ndocumentação solicitada pela SUPPRI. \n\nContudo, em reunião realizada em 4.12.2019, a SUPPRI, diferentemente do quanto \n\nhavia se comprometido em audiência, informou que alteraria o procedimento da ETE e que \n\nseria  necessário  licenciamento  ambiental  de  ampliação,  e  não  mais  o  adendo  ao  AIA \n\nconforme  orientação  prévia.  Em  5.12.2019,  a  SUPPRI  realizou  vistoria  na  área  e,  na \n\nsequência, a Fundação Renova iniciou a elaboração dos estudos necessários conforme nova \n\norientação, tendo providenciado o protocolo perante os órgãos competentes em 4.2.2020. \n\nO  licenciamento  ambiental  de  alteração  da  localização  da  ETE  pela  SUPPRI  foi \n\nfinalizado apenas no dia 26.6.2020 e as obras para construção da ETE iniciadas em 10.8.2020, \n\ncom  a  supressão  da  vegetação  da  área  para  a  primeira  etapa  da  fase  de  implantação  do \n\nprojeto.  Houve  impacto  significativo  ao  cronograma  das  obras  da  ETE  em  virtude  da \n\nreorientação do processo de licenciamento, na medida em que houve um transcurso de 205 \n\ndias entre a informação emitida pela SUPPRI sobre a necessidade de novo licenciamento, em \n\n4.12.2019, e a efetiva concessão da licença, em 26.6.2019. Logo, houve um atraso de 205 \n\ndias em relação à data inicialmente prevista para conclusão da ETE. \n\n38 \n\n \n \n\fO  fato  é  que  a  orientação  equivocada  dos  órgãos  ambientais  competentes  em \n\naudiência  judicial  e  alteração  de  postura  durante  os  procedimentos  administrativos  deu \n\ncausa aos atrasos para obtenção das licenças necessárias ao início das obras da ETE do Novo \n\nBento Rodrigues, o que não pode em hipótese alguma ser imputado à Fundação Renova. \n\nSome-se  a  isso  o  fato  de  ter  sido  proferia  decisão  em  22.9.2020,  nos  autos  do \n\ncumprimento de sentença nº 5002815-45.2019.8.13.0400, que fixou o prazo, até dezembro \n\nde  2020,  para  formação  de  novos  núcleos  familiares  a  serem  atendidos  em  qualquer \n\nmodalidade de reassentamento separadamente de seus núcleos familiares originários. \n\nNão obstante a discussão judicial, a Fundação Renova vem iniciando os atendimentos \n\naos novos núcleos estabelecidos até janeiro de 2019, e que atendem a critérios de formação \n\nnão passíveis de questionamentos judiciais. Até o momento 19 atendimentos se encontram \n\nem desenvolvimento, sendo 7 nos reassentamentos coletivos e 12 no familiar.  \n\nDa  mesma  forma,  não  se  deve \n\nignorar  os  constantes  e  reiterados  óbices \n\napresentados pela assessoria técnica Cáritas Brasileira em assuntos diversos, seja em relação \n\naos  ajustes  propostos  pela  Fundação  Renova  em  adequação  ao  momento  atual  com  a \n\nrealização de atendimentos remotos, seja para conclusão dos trabalhos de cadastramento, \n\nou durante os atendimentos com os atingidos.  \n\nConsiderando que a implementação dos reassentamentos exige o cumprimento das \n\netapas  e  procedimentos  acordados,  e  que  estes  demandam  a  participação/validação  das \n\nfamílias  em  conjunto  com  a  Assessoria  Técnica  –  Cáritas  e  que  a  pandemia  ocasionou \n\nadequações  ao  processo  de  trabalho  e  mantém  restrições  ao  modelo  inicialmente \n\nestruturado,  por  certo  que  existe  impacto  no  cronograma  de  execução  e  entrega  dos \n\nreassentamentos.  De  todo  modo,  é  importante  expor  que  desde  o  início  da  pandemia \n\nCOVID-19,  a  Fundação  Renova  adotou  medidas  para  continuidade  dos  reassentamentos, \n\n39 \n\n \n \n\fadequando e buscando alternativas, considerando os protocolos e orientações de saúde e \n\nsegurança das autoridades.   \n\nDesde  abril/2020,  ou  seja,  momento  seguinte  ao  início  da  pandemia,  a  Fundação \n\nRenova  tem  proposto  e  implementado  atividades  remotas  junto  as  famílias  e  fóruns \n\ncoletivos com o objetivo de dar prosseguimento aos atendimentos e, consequentemente, a \n\nentrega  dos  reassentamentos.  Com  o  desafio  de  manter  as  metodologias  pactuadas,  e \n\nincorporar  sua  realização  virtual,  após  1  (um)  ano  temos  dados  que  comprovam  a \n\nimportância da adoção dessa medida, ainda que em oposição à Assessoria Técnica – Cáritas \n\ne Comissão de Atingidos (materializada em documentos remetidos à Fundação Renova).  \n\nAs  metodologias  anteriormente  pactuadas,  seja  de  acompanhamento  das  obras, \n\nvisita a lote, desenvolvimento dos projetos conceituais das casas e escolhas de acabamentos, \n\nassinaturas de termos etc. passaram a ser ofertadas em ambiente virtual, resguardando-se \n\na  liberalidade  da  família  no  engajamento,  a  segurança  dos  envolvidos  sem  perder  a \n\nqualidade nos atendimentos e respeitando o direito das famílias de serem acompanhadas \n\npela  sua  assessoria  técnica.  A  Fundação  Renova  também  buscou  medidas  para \n\ndisponibilização  de  equipamentos  (como  tablets),  organização  de  toda  logística  para \n\nefetivação dos atendimentos (disponibilização dos links, treinamento dos colaboradores e \n\napoio  remoto  às  famílias  para  melhor  utilização  das  ferramentas), bem  como  o  apoio  ao \n\nacesso à internet (mediante custeio dos pagamentos de serviços de internet, repassados às \n\nfamílias, durante período de realização dos atendimentos).  \n\nAlguns resultados dessa iniciativa revelam o quanto a Fundação Renova e as famílias \n\nelegíveis  ao  reassentamento  se  esforçaram  para  a  superação  dos  entraves  causados  pela \n\npandemia,  seja  através  da  incorporação  às  metodologias  virtuais  (disponíveis  de  forma \n\nexclusiva  nos  momentos  iniciais  da  pandemia)  seja  através  do  retorno  às  atividades \n\npresenciais  de  modo  seguro  e  atendendo  as  recomendações  de  saúde  e  segurança \n\n40 \n\n \n \n\fgovernamentais (quando possível e desde que haja anuência da própria família), dentre os \n\nquais destacamos a finalização de 97 projetos conceituais, incluindo bens coletivos,  e 55 em \n\ndesenvolvimento, 222 termos assinados e 85 visitas realizadas ao lote e à obra, sendo 65 em \n\nformato presencial dentro do protocolo e 20 visitas virtuais.  \n\nNo caso das atividades presenciais, destacamos como medidas adotadas: utilização \n\nde  envelopes  adequados  para  higienização  e  quarentena  dos  documentos  enviados  à \n\nfamília; uso de sistema virtual para assinatura de documentos, testagem semanal da equipe \n\nque  tem  interação  com  os  atingidos,  disponibilização  de  álcool  gel  e  máscara  nas  visitas \n\npresenciais, entre outros.  \n\nPor certo que o atual contexto impõe restrições e, consequentemente, impacto de \n\nprazo para o cumprimento da obrigação de entrega dos reassentamentos. Portanto, cabe ao \n\nconjunto dos atores envolvidos (Fundação Renova, Famílias, Assessoria Técnica– Cáritas e \n\nComissão) o fortalecimento dos arranjos propostos para o alcance dos objetivos de entregas. \n\nComo demonstrado, são diversos os fatores externos à atuação da Fundação Renova \n\nque    dificultam  o  andamento  dos  trabalhos  dos  reassentamentos:  (i)  a  conclusão  ainda \n\npendente do processo de cadastramento conduzido pela assessoria técnica dos atingidos, \n\n(ii) pendência de definição sobre as compensações das moradias previstas em diretrizes de \n\nreassentamento,  (iii)  possibilidade  de  readequação  e  destinação  de \n\nlotes  vagos \n\nindefinidamente,  (iv)  impactos  das  diretrizes  de  reassentamento  homologadas  para \n\nelaboração  dos  projetos  dos  reassentamentos,  (v)  variação  das  condições  climáticas,  (vi) \n\nnecessidade de participação ativa e aprovação dos projetos das residências pelos próprios \n\natingidos, (vii) aprovação de projetos pelos órgãos municipais competentes, entre outros.  \n\nÉ  importante  registrar  também  que  o  processo  de  cadastramento  conduzido  pela \n\nCáritas Brasileira, incluindo a fase 1 (aplicação do formulário), ainda não foi finalizado em \n\nMariana.  Como  se  sabe,  muito  embora  a  conclusão  do  cadastro  fosse  essencial  para  o \n\n41 \n\n \n \n\flevantamento das informações pertinentes ao reassentamento, a Fundação Renova precisa \n\ndar andamento aos projetos, ainda que no decorrer dos trabalhos ajustes tivessem que ser \n\nrealizados para adequá-los às informações colhidas durante o cadastramento. \n\nAté  mesmo  sob  o  aspecto  de  atendimento  de  novos  núcleos  familiares  formados \n\napós  o  Rompimento,  a  conclusão  do  cadastro  é  uma  das  premissas  estabelecidas  para  o \n\natendimento, conforme previsto na diretriz nº 2 homologada em 6.2.201814 nos autos da \n\nACP Mariana. Trata-se de fator inequivocamente externo à atuação da Fundação Renova e \n\nque também influi diretamente na conclusão dos reassentamentos. \n\nAdemais, em decorrência do processo amplamente participativo e individualizado - \n\nem  que é  garantido  aos  atingidos  a  opção pela modalidade  de  reassentamento  (coletivo, \n\nfamiliar ou reconstrução  quando  aplicável),  participação  ativa  na  elaboração  e  aprovação \n\ndos  projetos  conceituais  dos  imóveis,  além  de  escolha  dos  imóveis  para  estudos  e \n\nnegociações necessárias à compra na hipótese dos reassentamentos familiares, estando o \n\nprocesso sujeito a questões absolutamente subjetivas, relacionadas ao processo de escolha \n\ndos atingidos e de sua participação na elaboração dos projetos, o cumprimento do prazo \n\nfixado  consiste  em  obrigação  impossível,  que  não  pode  ser  atendida  apenas  com  os \n\ntrabalhos da Fundação Renova.  \n\n14  “2.  Para  respeitar  a  conformação  atual  dos  núcleos  familiares,  abarcando  os  casos  de  separação,  novas  uniões, \nfalecimentos, nascimentos e outros casos, as Empresas, por meio da Fundação Renova, deverão garantir um imóvel para cada \nnúcleo, quando assim for o desejo do núcleo familiar, observados critérios razoáveis e geralmente aceitos, regras de aferição \nda formação da efetiva formação de novos núcleos familiares, e que tal realidade esteja considerada no cadastro” (g.n.). \n\n42 \n\n \n \n                                       \n\fAlém  de  questões  burocráticas,  climáticas  e  regras  sanitárias,  a  entrega  de  cada \n\nimóvel  depende  da  escolha  e  do  andamento  do  projeto  de  cada  família,  bem  como  da \n\naprovação pela Prefeitura Municipal. Veja-se o quadro esquematizado a seguir: \n\nNão  obstante  o  reassentamento  da  comunidade  seja  coletivo,  é  inegável  que  o \n\nprocesso participativo e individualizado garantido aos atingidos impõe disparidades quanto \n\naos  status  de  cada  residência.  Os  fatos  estão  postos  e  são  claros:  além  de  inviável  a \n\nimposição de entrega de todas as moradias em uma data única, já que a conclusão das obras \n\ndas  moradias  depende da  elaboração  e  aprovação  de  projetos  pelos  próprios  atingidos e \n\npela Prefeitura Municipal. \n\nTodos  esses  fatores  demonstram  que  não  é  razoável  a  fixação  de  uma  data  que \n\nconsidere a entrega de todas as residências, pois os projetos dependem dos atingidos, de \n\nforma  que  a  Fundação  Renova  não  é  direta  e  exclusivamente  responsável  pelo  não \n\natendimento de prazos.  \n\n43 \n\n \n \n\fJustamente porque o processo de elaboração e aprovação dos projetos das casas é \n\nindividualizado  e  altamente  customizado,  a  Fundação  Renova  depara-se  frequentemente \n\ncom  situações  em  que  não  é  possível  avançar  com  etapas  de  atendimento  das  famílias \n\nporquanto  algumas  dessas  famílias,  em  determinadas  situações,  exigem  ou  impõem \n\ncondições que não lhes são de direito. Também há situações que, se aceitas pela Fundação \n\nRenova, implicam quebra de isonomia em relação aos demais atendimentos, podendo gerar \n\ngraves e irremediáveis disparidades sociais nos reassentamentos. Por outro lado, há casos \n\nem que a Fundação Renova vislumbra possibilidade de consenso com famílias, justificando, \n\nem determinadas situações de vulnerabilidade social, excepcionar métricas e procedimentos \n\nvigentes,  e  entendimentos  envolvendo  conceitos  e  requisitos  das  diretrizes  dos \n\nreassentamentos. \n\nTais casos, para melhor referência e direcionamento de ações pela Fundação Renova, \n\nsão denominados “casos interrompidos”. Como a interrupção do atendimento decorre de \n\nato/decisão da família, os números que representam os “casos interrompidos” podem ser \n\nalterados – e o são em razão da dinamicidade dos atendimentos – quando há interesse e/ou \n\npossibilidade da família em prosseguir com seu atendimento. \n\nOs  casos  interrompidos originam-se por  múltiplos  fatores,  incluindo, por  exemplo, \n\ncasos  em  que  há  evidente  abuso  de  direito,  na  medida  em  que  se  exige  providência  da \n\nFundação Renova que sequer está associada ao programa de reassentamentos. Há diversos \n\noutros exemplos. Ainda que tais casos interrompidos digam respeito a situações individuais, \n\ndada  a  interlocução  entre  os  atores  dos  reassentamentos,  a  Fundação  Renova  busca \n\nharmonizar as soluções, de maneira não haja prejuízo aos demais casos em andamento. \n\nA título exemplificativo, no reassentamento coletivo de Bento Rodrigues há casos em \n\nque há peculiaridade no entendimento das famílias quanto à razoabilidade da diretriz que \n\ntrata dos indícios de construção em lotes não edificados, outrora ocupados pelas famílias, e \n\nque justificaria a entrega de nova moradia. Também há divergência sobre os critérios para \n\n44 \n\n \n \n\fdesmembramento  de \n\nlotes  e \n\nidentificação  de  titularidade  da  propriedade  e  de \n\ncompensações.  \n\nA compensação deve ser considerada como processo complementar ao atendimento \n\nde reparação do direito à moradia, sendo aferida realizada após a devida comparação entre \n\nas obrigações pactuadas e o processo reparação. A Fundação Renova reconhece que está \n\nassegurado o direito a compensação, nos casos em que a reparação da moradia/propriedade \n\natingida não alcance os parâmetros mínimos estabelecidos nas Diretrizes.  \n\nDestaca-se que, uma vez que não existe referências metodológicas específicas para \n\ndefinir  parâmetros de  compensação, em 2019 foi  iniciado  um processo de elaboração  de \n\nmetodologias  de  apuração  e  de  cálculo,  buscando  chegar  a  um  consenso  com  Assessoria \n\nTécnica – Cáritas dos atingidos e o MP. \n\nNos meses de junho de 2019 e julho de 2020 o Ministério Público apresentou, em \n\nâmbito judicial, proposta de metodologia desenvolvida pela Assessoria Técnica dos atingidos \n\n– Cáritas. Não havendo consenso entre as partes, hoje este tema é pauta tratada no âmbito \n\njudicial. Dentre as compensações que estão sendo discutidas, estão incluídas: I)diferença de \n\nárea  de  lote:  quando  o  lote  recebido  pela  família  é  inferior  a  área  mínima  de  250m² \n\n(estabelecido  em  Diretriz)  ou  a  área  verificada  na  propriedade  de  origem;  II)diferença  de \n\ntestada de lote: quando a testada (frente do lote) é inferior àquela verificada na propriedade \n\nde  origem  ou  inferior  aos  12m  estabelecidos  pela  legislação  municipal;  III)declividade: \n\nquando  a  declividade  do  lote  do  reassentamento  é  superior  àquela  encontrada  na \n\npropriedade de origem. \n\nA Assessoria Técnica – Cáritas apresenta também outras tipologias de compensação, \n\nque não foram objeto de acordo:  \n\n• \n\nperda  de  vizinhança:  os  rearranjos  e  readequações  dos \n\nlotes  nos \n\nreassentamentos  coletivos  não  significam  perda  efetiva  de  vizinhança,  já  que  as  famílias \n\n45 \n\n \n \n\fpermanecem na mesma comunidade e, portanto, não há quebra das relações comunitárias \n\nestabelecidas na origem. Quanto ao Reassentamento Familiar, a compensação não se aplica \n\nem razão de ser uma livre escolha do próprio atingido no seu processo de atendimento na \n\nreparação do direito à moradia em um contexto alternativas que se apresentam de mudança \n\npara outra comunidade. \n\n• \n\nperda de acesso a fontes de água: O acesso à água tratada está garantindo \n\ntanto  pela  infraestrutura  construída  para  os  reassentamentos  coletivos,  quanto  pela \n\navaliação dos imóveis adquiridos pelo Reassentamento Familiar.  \n\n• \n\nperda  de  aptidão  agrícola:  o  processo  de  reestruturação  produtiva  inclui \n\natividades  que  auxiliam  na  adequação  das  propriedades  destino  ao  melhor  uso  pelos \n\natingidos.  Neste  processo,  será  garantida  a  retomada  e  incremento  das  atividades \n\nprodutivas  nos  imóveis  adquiridos  para  os  reassentamentos  coletivos  e  familiar,  além  da \n\nrecuperação ambiental dos imóveis atingidos. \n\nHá,  ainda,  casos  interrompidos  em  razão  de  peculiaridades/vulnerabilidades  das \n\nfamílias envolvendo herança e questões sucessórias. Também há caso em que não é possível \n\navançar com o projeto da família por reiteradas divergências manifestadas por estas com \n\nrelação ao cadastro elaborado pela Cáritas Brasileira. \n\nEm relação ao reassentamento coletivo de Paracatu de Baixo, há, até o momento, \n\ncasos envolvem divergências para a localização do lote, insatisfação com outros programas \n\nda  Fundação  Renova  e  reiteradas  divergências  com  a  Cáritas  Brasileira,  manifestadas  em \n\nrelação ao cadastro da família. \n\nJá com relação ao reassentamento familiar, também há interrupção do atendimento, \n\npor exemplo, em razão de divergências sucessórias, discordância quanto ao tamanho de lote \n\n46 \n\n \n \n\fe divergência sobre a venda realizada pelo atingido tanto do lote adquirido em seu nome \n\nquanto do direito futuro à moradia concedido pela Fundação Renova. \n\nA despeito de todos os impactos decorrentes dos fatores externos e alheios à atuação \n\ndas  Empresas  e  da  Fundação  Renova, no  que  diz  respeito  ao reassentamento  coletivo  de \n\nBento Rodrigues, foram finalizadas as obras dos seguintes equipamentos públicos: (i) escola \n\nmunicipal, (ii) posto de saúde e serviços, (iii) terraplanagem e contenções de 103 imóveis, \n\n(iii) arruamento  das  vias  públicas,  (iv)  iluminação  pública,  (v)  drenagem  pluvial,  (vi)  rede \n\ncoletora de esgoto e (vii) estação de tratamento de esgoto. Ainda, das 213 casas que estão \n\natualmente  previstas  no  âmbito  do  reassentamento  coletivo15,  9  foram  concluídas  e  36 \n\nestão em construção. \n\nEm  relação  ao  reassentamento  coletivo  de  Paracatu  de  Baixo,  especialmente  em \n\nrazão  das  diferenças  entre  os  principais  marcos  temporais  de \n\ninício  das  obras, \n\ncomparativamente  ao  reassentamento  coletivo  de  Bento  Rodrigues  –  destaca-se,  como \n\nfatores de diferenciação, a escolha da área pelos atingidos e a emissão do DAIA somente em \n\n18.6.2019 -, o status das obras encontra-se em estágio distinto, o que reforça a necessidade \n\nde segmentação do prazo para a sua entrega.  \n\nAté o momento, foram finalizadas as obras (i) de drenagem profunda da Área 1 (área \n\nlocalizada no entorno da Praça Santo Antônio) e da Rua Monsenhor Horta, (ii) de contenção \n\nentre  as  Áreas  de  Preservação  Permanente  e  Área  1  e  da  Rua  Monsenhor  Horta,  (iii)  de \n\ndrenagem superficial, bem como estão em andamento as obras (iv) da escola municipal, (v) \n\ndas  vias  de  acesso  ao Novo  Paracatu,  (vi) de  arruamento  das  vias  públicas.  Ainda, das  86 \n\ncasas  e  14  lotes  vagos  que  estão  atualmente  previstos  no  âmbito  do  reassentamento \n\ncoletivo, foram concluídas as fundações de 6 residências, cujas obras estão em andamento. \n\n15  Trata-se  de  número  variável,  pois  pode  haver  alteração  da  opção  dos  atingidos  sobre  a  modalidade  de \nreparação ao direito à moradia, e.g. migração do reassentamento coletivo para o familiar (compra assistida). \n\n47 \n\n \n \n                                       \n\fAlém disso, é importante mencionar que, até o momento, 138 famílias optaram pelo \n\nreassentamento  familiar  (compra  assistida  de  imóvel  fora  do  reassentamento  coletivo, \n\nconforme  opção  do  núcleo familiar  atingido),  de  modo que  foram adquiridos 57 imóveis; \n\ndesses, 53 demandam construção ou reforma para entrega ao núcleo familiar e 4 são lotes \n\nvagos,  que  também  demandam  projetos,  licenças  simplificadas  e  obras  para  serem \n\nentregues. Nesse sentido, foram concluídas as obras de 6 imóveis e as obras de 2 imóveis \n\nestão em fase de finalização. Também no reassentamento familiar, há 1 imóvel cujas obras \n\nforam iniciadas após a respectiva escolha do local pelo núcleo familiar e aquisição do bem \n\npela  Fundação  Renova.  Por  fim,  7  imóveis  foram  reconstruídos  e  entregues  às  famílias \n\natingidas. \n\nPara melhor visualizar os equipamentos públicos já finalizados, são apresentadas a \n\nseguir fotografias da ETE e da Escola e ginásio de esportes no reassentamento coletivo de \n\nNovo Bento: \n\n48 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fComo  se  nota,  embora  os  reassentamentos  não  tenham  sido  integralmente \n\nconcluídos, não há, por parte da Fundação Renova, inércia no cumprimento da obrigação \n\nque justifique a aplicação integral do valor da multa.

INITIAL  CONSIDERATIONS  REGARDING  THE  CELEBRATION  OF  THE  TTAC  AND  RENOVA \n\nFOUNDATION \n\nOn  March  2,  2016,  the  Transaction  and  Conduct  Adjustment  Term  (\"TTAC\")1  was \n\ncelebrated  (Annex  1.),  between  SAMARCO  MINERAÇÃO  S.A.

The \n\nFoundation is subject to independent external auditing - according to the TTAC terms - and, \n\nbased  on  Article  66  of  the  Civil  Code,  operates  under  the  supervision  of  the  Public \n\nProsecutor's Office for the State of Minas Gerais (\"MPMG\"). \n\nIn order to execute programs and conduct activities, the FOUNDATION has adopted, \n\nsince  its  establishment,  an  innovative  model  of  multi-stakeholder  governance,  with  the \n\ninvolvement  of  civil  society  through  the  Advisory  Board,  conceived  to  ensure  active \n\nparticipation of impacted communities in defining and developing programs; (ii) government \n\nagencies  through  CIF  and  the  Technical  Chambers,  and  (iii)  External  and  Independent \n\nAuditing. Thus, it has become a new paradigm of institution to address situations involving \n\nhumanitarian and environmental disasters, which demand solutions far beyond emergency \n\nmeasures. \n\nOn  June 25,  2018,  an  adjustment  term  was  signed between the  signatories  of  the \n\nTTAC,  as  well  as  the  Federal  Public  Prosecutor's  Office,  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  for  the \n\nStates of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, the Federal Public Defender's Office, and Public \n\nDefender's Office for the States of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, with the intervention-\n\n4 However, the implementation of these programs follows several principles and premises, among which the \nfollowing should be highlighted (1) transparency and engagement of the impacted communities in the actions \nto be implemented; (2) recovery of the environment, reconstruction of the affected public infrastructure, and \nsocioeconomic and indemnification actions in order to minimize the impacts and to fully repair those impacts; \n(3)  definition  of  objective  schedules  for  projects;  (4)  actions  to  be  executed  must  be  governed  by \nproportionality and efficiency, defined on the basis of technical and scientific criteria to assess and quantify \nsuch  impacts;  (5)  continuous  dialogue  between  CIF,  the  FOUNDATION  and  impacted  people;  (6)  private \nexecution of programs, under the permanent governmental supervision; (7) periodic review of obligations; and \n(8) respect for human rights of impacted individuals. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n                                       \n\fconsent of the FOUNDATION, which addresses issues related to governance processes and \n\nsocial participation, which was ratified in a recent solemn session held on August 8, 2018 \n\n(\"TAC GOVERNANCE\") (Annex 2) \n\nThese are adjustments to optimize the existing governance system, provided for by \n\nthe  TTAC,  in  order  to  increase  social  participation  and  raise  the  quality  of  the  decision-\n\nmaking process, so as to avoid delays in the schedule to implement programs and projects \n\nconducted by the FOUNDATION. \n\nConsidering  the  aforementioned,  it  is  evident  that  the  activities  executed  by  the \n\nFOUNDATION are framed within a model of governance that is unprecedented in Brazil. In \n\naddition  to \n\nlegal  obligations,  there  are  guidelines  for  transparency,  dialogue  and \n\nparticipation of society. It is understood that this is the only way to construct lasting solutions \n\nthat address the  concerns  of  the  affected  population  and  allow  for  the development  and \n\nrecovery  of  the  impacted  regions.  This  interaction  enables  social  and  environmental \n\npractices to be debated, defined, implemented, monitored, and improved over a period of \n\ntime. \n\nII. HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE RENOVA FOUNDATION \n\nThe Renova Foundation was created to repair, compensate and restore the damages \n\ncaused by the failure of the Fundão Dam. As a consequence of this disaster, many areas were \n\naffected and people and communities had their lifestyles impacted, being deprived of the \n\nexercise and enjoyment of fundamental rights, such as environment and land use, housing, \n\naccess  to  water and  food,  education,  cultural  and  religious  practices,  economic  activities, \n\nfishing and farming, among others. \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n\fIn this regard, the institution develops a series of actions and measures necessary to \n\nrepair the affected communities and municipalities, through programs based on two main \n\nfronts: remediation and compensation. The first consists in restoring and reestablishing the \n\ncommunities and resources impacted by the by the dam failure. The compensation front, on \n\nthe other hand, aims to replace or compensate for what cannot be remedied.  \n\nIn  order  to  address  the  reparation,  TTAC  has  a  programmatic  language,  that  is, \n\nprovides for the implementation of 42 socioeconomic and socioenvironmental programs. In \n\nthe human rights language, these programs aim to repair  human rights, among which is \n\nthe  human  right  to  decent  housing,  through  the  resettlement  and  reconstruction  of \n\nvillages program, object of the present document. \n\nAccording to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \n\n(POs, 2010)5, the State is responsible for ensuring respect (\"fulfill\") and protection against \n\nhuman rights abuses committed by third parties, including businesses; it is the responsibility \n\nof  business  (and  third  sector  institutions)  to  respect  human  rights  (including  across  their \n\nvalue chain); and it is the duty of States and business (and third sector institutions) to ensure \n\nthat victims of human rights violations have access to appropriate and effective reparation \n\nand remediation measures.   \n\nThe preparation of a specific policy on the matter was provided for under Clause 223 \n\nof  the  TTAC  to  ensure  such  respect  for  human  rights.  More  than  abstract  principles,  the \n\nRenova  Foundation  Human  Rights  Policy  (2018)6  provides  for  the  adoption  of  concrete \n\nactions aimed at building a culture of human rights throughout the reparation process. \n\n5 UN.

The Human Rights Management \n\n(GDH) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of such guidelines within the scope \n\nof  the  Renova  Foundation's  operations.  The  pillars  of  action  of  this  department  are  also \n\nworth highlighting: \n\ni. \n\nEducation and promotion of respect for Human Rights, aimed at training employees \n\nand  outsourced  personnel,  through  online  and  in-person  training,  dialogues  and \n\nlectures, production of educational materials, awareness campaigns, among others;  \n\nii. \n\nPrevention of adverse impacts to Human Rights through risk analysis and monitoring \n\nwithin the programs and areas of the institution;  \n\niii. \n\nRemediation  of  individual  cases  negatively  impacted  throughout  the  reparation \n\nprocess. \n\nIII. NORMATIVE MILESTONES FOR PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO DECENT HOUSING \n\na)  International Norms \n\nThe human right to adequate living standards has been recognized in international \n\nhuman rights law since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). The International \n\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966, Article 11.1) provides for decent \n\nhousing  as  a  component  of  such  an  adequate  living  standard:  “The  States  Parties  to  the \n\npresent  Covenant  recognize  the  right  of  everyone  to  an  adequate  standard  of  living  for \n\nhimself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous \n\nimprovement of living conditions.8”  \n\n7 Renova Foundation Human Rights Guidelines (2020) \n8  UN.

In Article 6, the right to housing is \n\nconsidered a fundamental right in the field of social rights, reiterating its importance as an \n\ninstitute to be protected and preserved.

THE RENOVA FOUNDATION RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM  \n\nIn  order  to  ensure  the  human  right  to  decent  housing,  according  to  parameters \n\nprovided  for  in  international  and  national  legislation,  in  the  context  of  the  post-failure \n\nscenario  of  the  Fundão  Dam  (2015),  the  Renova  Foundation  executes  the  Resettlement \n\nProgram, provided for under Clauses 76 to 78 of the TTAC, which establishes actions for the \n\nrecovery, reconstruction and relocation of the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu de \n\nBaixo and Gesteira. The Program also supports some rural properties in the municipality of \n\nMariana  and  Barra  Longa,  which  were  considered  eligible.  The  Resettlement  Program \n\ncomprises the following measures: \n\na)  Provision  of  temporary  housing,  according  to  the  family  needs  (number  of \n\nrooms/accessibility) soon after the failure; \n\nb)  Right  to  information  and  participation  through  residents’  commissions  from \n\nimpacted communities - Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu and Rural Area Commission - for \n\ndiscussions on the resettlement process - which currently meet on a monthly basis \n\nwith the participation of the Renova Foundation and Technical Advisory - Cáritas. \n\nc)  Contracting of independent technical advisory - Cáritas Brasileira - that accompanies \n\naffected \n\ncommunities \n\nin \n\ndiscussions \n\ninvolving \n\nsocioeconomic \n\nand \n\nsocioenvironmental  programs,  with  all  work  methodologies  prepared  by  the \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n\fFOUNDATION  validated  by  the  residents'  commission  and  respective  technical \n\nadvisory; and \n\nd)  Compliance  with  IFC/World  Bank Performance Standard  05  -  Land  Acquisition  and \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement,  which  provides  as  guidelines:  anticipate,  avoid,  and \n\nminimize  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts  from  land  acquisition  or  use \n\nrestrictions;  undertake  activities  only  after  appropriate  disclosure  of  information, \n\nconsultation, and participation of affected parties; improve or restore the livelihoods \n\nand  standards  of  living  of  displaced  people;  and  improve  the  living  conditions  of \n\nresettled people. \n\nThe  program  also  uses  the  UN  recommendations  as  a  reference,  through  the \n\nAdequate Housing Manual 10, which proposes attention to the right to housing in terms of \n\ninfrastructure,  privacy,  access  to  services,  and  security  in  order  to  comply  with  all  the \n\nrequirements and environmental legislation in force: \n\ni. \n\nInvolvement of the competent environmental agencies in the search for sustainable \n\nsolutions and ensuring celerity in the resettlement licensing processes; \n\nii.

BRIEF CONSIDERATIONS ON THE RESETTLEMENT PARTICIPATORY PROCESS \n\n The Resettlement Process of communities affected by the failure of the Fundão Dam, \n\nsince the initial phase, has as main assumption the active participation of communities and \n\neligible families, in their own time, according to the best practices and guidelines of national \n\nand international organizations that address the matter. \n\nHowever, the resettlement processes under discussion, as a result of a disaster, have \n\nmany particularities and novelties, which can be verified from the choice of host areas by \n\nthe affected communities.  \n\nThe  selection  of  host  areas  for  the  resettlements  started  in  January  2016,  with  a \n\nmethodological process that included several meetings with the community, consisting of \n\nthe following macro stages: \n\n1.  Discussion  and  definition  of  criteria  that  directed  the  survey  of  possible  land  for \nresettlements through assemblies: \n\na) Bento Rodrigues:  \n\nFor Bento Rodrigues, there was previous organization of the community to define the \n\ncriteria to consider when choosing the land in an assembly held on 01/27/16. Those criteria \n\nare summarized below, containing the agreements and attendances contemplated in their \n\nexecution. \n\n11 Resettlement Program references include: (i) Performance Standard 05  - IFC, World Bank; (ii) Law 10.257, City \nStatute (7/10/2001); (iii) World Bank Operational Manual for Resettlements, OP 4.12 of DEC/01 and (iv) Right to \nAdequate Housing UN - SDH 2013. \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                       \n\fPrioritization  Land Survey Criteria \n1st \n\nSoil quality for planting \nand animal farming \n\n2nd \n\n3rd \n\n4th \n\n5th \n\n6th \n\nWater \nproximity to springs \n\nsupply \n\nand \n\nHealth -  the area  must \nhave  easy  access  to \npublic health services \n\nLand  suitable  for  the \nimplementation  of  a \nsewage system \n\nArea Public Safety - the \narea  should  have  easy \naccess \npolicing \nto \nroutes \nArea \nwith \nenvironmental  quality \nand \nthat  promotes \nenvironmental  safety, \nareas \nfrom \naway \nsusceptible to flooding, \nto \nnot \nsubject \nlandslides \nand \noperations  \n\nAgreement \nThe chosen land provides for the resumption \nof existing productive activities in the original \narea.

In October 2016, a public deed of \n\npurchase  and  sale  was drawn  up  between  ArcelorMittal  and the  Renova  Foundation, the \n\nobject of which was the area hosting the resettlement in the location known as \"Lavoura\". \n\nAs  of  November  20,  2016,  georeferencing  and  certification  at  INCRA  became \n\nmandatory  for  properties  larger  than  100  hectares  in  order  to  alter  the  real  estate \n\nregistration, such as the registration of the purchase and sale.  \n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fArcelorMittal, owner of the area, was unable to obtain the consent of all neighbors, \n\nwho  claimed  problems  with  the  property  boundaries.  Therefore,  in  December  2016 \n\ndiscussions  started  regarding  alternative  ways  to  transfer  the  property.  This  is  a  typical \n\nexample of a complex land problem that requires time and highly specialized professionals.  \n\nIn addition, State Decree 44.646/200712 of the State of Minas Gerais, which regulates \n\nthe  submission  of  projects  for  land  subdivisions  and  dismemberment  of  areas  for  urban \n\npurposes  in  the  municipalities  of  Minas  Gerais,  imposes  restrictions  for  subdivisions  that \n\nhave land with slopes above 47%, which was the case of the Bento resettlement, as a small \n\nportion of the land was in such condition. When the community chose the land, the Renova \n\nFoundation had already committed to rectifying this slope, but the rule was interpreted in a \n\nrestrictive fashion. \n\nWith  that,  in  June  2017,  a  public  hearing  was  held,  which  concluded  that  it  was \n\nnecessary to adjust the urban project with respect to the legal restrictions for subdivisions \n\nin areas with slopes above 47%, as provided for in the state decree. \n\nAfter overcoming these and other challenges along the way, at the end of 2017 the \n\napproval of the complementary law project that would convert the host area into an urban \n\nexpansion  area,  for  the  purpose  of  implementing  the  collective  resettlement,  culminated \n\nwith the sanction of the complementary law, finally solving the land regularization. \n\nIn early 2018, the Foundation ratified the guiding assumptions and guidelines of the \n\nresettlement  policy  with  the  Commission  of  Affected  People  and  the  Public  Prosecutor's \n\nOffice, enabling subsequent work to resume normal course. \n\n12 MINAS GERAIS.

These  assumptions  were \n\ndefined by the parties (Public Prosecutor's Office, Commission of Affected People, Technical \n\nAdvisory  Entities,  companies  and  the  Renova  Foundation)  and  submitted  to  court  for \n\nratification. \n\nAfter  that,  the  layout  of  the  land  division  was  painstakingly  studied  in  order  to \n\nreconcile the topography of the land with the original layout of the affected district, so as to \n\npreserve  the  neighborhood  relations  and  the  way  of  life  of  the  community.  This  process \n\ndemanded  a  lot  of  time,  much  longer  than  the  average  development  time  of  a  parceling \n\nproject. \n\nOnly after all obstacles described previously were overcome, was the community able \n\nto  approve  the  conceptual  project,  while  discussions  were  held  with  the  Municipality  of \n\nMariana  for  the  publication  of  the  decrees  that  would  declare  the  host  area  as  of  social \n\ninterest and public utility for expropriation purposes.  \n\nA resettlement process with this level of complexity and participation, involving so \n\nmany entities and implemented in parallel to the preparation of assumptions and guidelines, \n\nis unprecedented, and although celerity is desired, it cannot be a limiting factor for the full \n\nreparation of the right to housing. \n\nAs an example of these challenges, we can mention the assumption established to \n\nstructure  a  subdivision  that  sought  to  recompose  the  neighborhood  relations  based  on \n\norigin, while at the same time complying with the legal framework and topography. \n\nAnother  differential  of  the  collective  resettlements  undertaken  by  the  Renova \n\nFoundation is the fact that house projects are jointly prepared and developed by architects \n\navailable for each family nucleus. \n\n15 \n\n \n \n\fThe  established  commitment  intends  to  build  custom  homes  for  the  families  and \n\nmeet  their  expectations,  which  is  why  the  preparation  period  of  the  project  is  variable. \n\nLikewise, the construction work also requires more time and complexity, since each house is \n\nexecuted in a specific way, in order to maintain the adequacy to the architectural design, \n\nstructure, and finishing chosen by the families. \n\nThis  methodology  is  not  the  common  model  of  any  other  resettlement  projects, \n\nadopt the development, that usually offers a maximum of 3 house types in order to ensure \n\nfast production scale, with greater uniformity and constructive control. \n\nb)  Paracatu de Baixo \n\nThe  criteria  were  validated  in  an  assembly  held  on  01/25/16.

Group discussion on the format to select the host area through weekly working \n\ngroups; \n\niv. \n\nSelection of the host areas after a detailed presentation of the information and \n\nvoting  process  created  and  defined \n\ntogether  with \n\nthe  community \n\nrepresentatives. \n\nThe entire process was extensively monitored by the competent public agencies, and \n\nvoting events in the host areas were held in the presence of the Public Prosecutor's Office \n\nand conducted by external auditors, ensuring process compliance. \n\nAfter the definition of the host areas, the discussions with the affected people for the \n\ndevelopment of conceptual urbanistic projects for the new communities were initiated. As \n\nthere  was  no  registration  information  for  the  families  due  to  the  restructuring  of  the \n\n17 \n\n \n \n \n\fregistration process proposed by the Public Prosecutor's Office and Cáritas, methodologies \n\nwere  developed  to  collect  information  that  could  subsidize  the  structuring  of  conceptual \n\nprojects,  as  well  as  the  continuity  of  the  resettlement  process.  The  following  steps  were \n\nconducted during the period from 2016 to 2018: \n\ni. \n\nSelf-demarcation of the land, based on the original areas, performed by families by \n\nmeans of workshops and assistance sessions. \n\nii. \n\nSurvey on expectations through a participatory methodology aimed at collecting the \n\ndemands  and  concerns  of  the  affected  people  to  support  the  development  of \n\nconceptual  urban  plans  for  the  new  communities.  The  workshops  resulted  in  an \n\nimportant record of community expectations that was validated, documented and \n\nformally delivered to the affected people.  \n\niii.  Workshops  for  the  construction  of  the  conceptual  urbanistic  projects  with  an \n\nexecution format prepared in conjunction with the commissions of affected people \n\nand  the  technical  advisors  -  Cáritas.  Several  workshops  were  held  with  broad \n\ncommunity  participation,  sometimes  in  small  groups,  sometimes  in  larger  formats \n\nthat  relied  on  the  use  of  different  communication  and  mediation  resources  to \n\nprovide clarity and understanding of information by the families. \n\niv.  Approval of the conceptual urbanistic projects also relied on a specific methodology \n\ndeveloped in dialogue with the commission of affected people and technical advisors. \n\nAssemblies  were  held  with  the  broad  participation  of  the  community,  competent \n\npublic agencies, and the Public Prosecutor's Office for the State of Minas Gerais. Only \n\nafter the approval of the conceptual plans, it was possible to proceed with the steps \n\nrelated  to  the  licensing  processes  and  the  necessary  authorizations  to  start  the \n\nconstruction work. \n\nBento Rodrigues \n\nParacatu de Baixo \n\n18 \n\n \n \n\fDate: 01/29/2018 \n\nDate: 09/13/2018 \n\nApproval \n\nNumber \n\nof \n\nApproval \n\nNumber  of  Voting \n\nPercentage \n\nVoting Families \n\nPercentage \n\nFamilies \n\n99% \n\n180 \n\n97% \n\n98 \n\nIt  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  processes  followed  the  same  steps,  but \n\nmaintained the particularities and adaptations necessary for each of the communities. \n\nIV. II. THE FAMILY REGISTRATION PROCESS  \n\nThe  Integrated  Registration  methodology  was  developed  with  the  participation  of \n\nrepresentatives  from  public  institutions  and  other  entities  that  comprise  the  governance \n\ninstances of the Renova Foundation, especially those associated with the Social Organization \n\nTechnical Chamber (CTOS). Among these, the Ministry of Citizenship, the managing body of \n\nthe Social Programs Unified Register of the Federal Government (CadÚnico), which managed \n\nthe registry of almost 30 million Brazilian families, and served as the basis for decision making \n\nand  granting  of  social  programs,  such  as  the  Bolsa  Família  Program,  stands  out.  The \n\nIntegrated Registration was initiated in July 2016 and extended throughout the entire Doce \n\nRiver basin, with the exception of the municipality of Mariana. \n\nEven  with  the  rationale  presented  for  the  development  of  the  Registration \n\nmethodology, the representatives of the affected communities in Mariana and the Public \n\nProsecutor's  Office  disagreed  with  the  beginning  of  the  process,  since  such  a  process \n\nrequired the prior assessment by the Affected People Technical Advisory - Cáritas. From then \n\non,  a  work  plan  was  established,  which  began  in  March  2017  and  culminated  in  weekly \n\nmeetings between technicians from the Renova Foundation, Cáritas, affected families and a \n\n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n\frepresentative from the Public Prosecutor's Office to discuss the registration process based \n\non the axes proposed by Cáritas.  \n\nThis  discussion  process  extended  until  October  2017,  with  extensive  production, \n\nexchange of technical materials, the construction of consensus, and a new instrument.  \n\nMoreover, at its discretion, Cáritas added other stages of information gathering with \n\nthe  families  (Social  Cartography  and  Term  Sheet),  expanding  the  information  gathering \n\nprocess. It should also be noted that, of the four stages of the Caritas registration process - \n\nApplication of the form, Loss and Damage Report, Social Cartography and Term Sheet -, the \n\nRenova Foundation participated only in the first two.  \n\nThroughout the application process, there were several technical meetings in order \n\nto  adjust  the  stages  and  the  adaptation  of  the  application  schedule  under  Cáritas' \n\nresponsibility, starting in January 2018 and initially scheduled for conclusion in March 2019. \n\nThis date was rescheduled for early 2020 to include the new list (140 families) presented by \n\nCáritas, consolidated in 2019, but these people have not concluded the registration process \n\nto date. Currently, there is an ongoing discussion to renegotiate the term for the conclusion \n\nof the registration process, considering the requests made until 2019. \n\nIt is fundamental to highlight the impacts related to the extension of the registration \n\nprocess of the affected people in Mariana, a fundamental basis to subsidize the reparation \n\nprocess. Consequently, the resettlement needed to use the information available through \n\nalternative methodologies (self-demarcation, expectations survey, emergency/ Civil Defense \n\nregistration). \n\nAfter concluding the discussions on the Affected People Registration, and given the \n\ncomplexity  of  the  negotiations  associated  with  the  feasibility  of  the  affected  families' \n\nresettlement process, in January 2018, the Renova Foundation presented a compilation of \n\nsigned  agreements  related  to  Resettlement,  also  considering  the  systematization  of  the \n\ndiscussions for the reformulation of the registration related to this matter.  \n\n20 \n\n \n \n\fBased on this, Cáritas developed a series of guidelines and presented these to the Renova \n\nFoundation. The document presented by the consultancy was analyzed and discussed among \n\nthe affected people, the Public Prosecutor's Office, Cáritas and Renova Foundation, resulting \n\nin  a  set  of  General  Resettlement  Guidelines  that  determines  the  service  policies  to  be \n\nadopted by the Renova Foundation in the reparation process for the Right to Housing. The \n\nguidelines were agreed upon in hearings in which the interested parties sought to establish \n\nconsensus, based on analyses and negotiations on such material.  \n\nThe discussion process occurred during 2018, and is recorded in the Hearing Minutes \n\nof the Case Files 0400.17.004149-7 and 0400.15.004335-6 from February 6, March 27, July \n\n7, and August 28 of that year. \n\nIn  total,  79  guidelines  were  approved,  covering  topics  such  as:  decent  housing, \n\nsecurity  of  tenure,  availability  of  services,  materials,  facilities,  and \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nhabitability, accessibility, as well as the resumption of productive activities, ways of life, and \n\nequal access to the communities' collective assets. \n\nDuring  subsequent  months  of  2018  and  2019,  assemblies  of  the  Working  Group  - \n\nInterdisciplinary/Housing  Working  Group  -  WG,  established  according  to the terms  of the \n\nhearing minutes dated 03.27.2018 within the scope of the ACP, were held. These meetings \n\nwere attended by representatives of Samarco Mineração S.A, Vale S.A, BHP Billiton Brasil \n\nLtda.,  Renova  Foundation,  the  Commission  of  Affected  People  of  Mariana  (CABF),  the \n\nTechnical  Advisory  of  the  affected  people  of  Mariana  -  Cáritas,  in  the  presence  of  the \n\nProsecutor  of  Justice  (MPMG),  with  the  objective  of  monitoring  the  actions  and \n\nimplementation of the resettlements and, especially, the definitions of the methodological \n\napplicability of agreed guidelines occurred during said meetings.  \n\nIt should be highlighted that discussions in public and participative spheres regarding \n\nthe  moment  for  families  to  adhere  to  the  modalities  of  assistance  are:  collective \n\n21 \n\n \n \n\fresettlement, family resettlement, and reconstruction. At the discretion of the family, it is \n\nalso possible to repair the right to housing by means of payment in cash. \n\nDiscussions  on  the  matter  have  advanced,  whereby  Guideline  No.  2  of  August  28, \n\n2018 established that the signing of the option term for the reparation modality to the right \n\nto housing for families entitled to collective resettlement, \"shall occur after the approval of \n\nthe construction project by the competent municipal agencies\", and that, \"as of the signing \n\nof  the  OPTION  TERM,  the  affected  person  definitely  waives  the  remaining  assistance \n\nmodalities, and there is no time limitation for the family to reach a decision. \n\nIn this same document, in Guideline No. 5, it is also defined that the signing of the \n\noption  term  for  affected  people  entitled  to  family  resettlement  that  the  moment  for \n\nadhesion and signing of the OPTION TERM shall be after the conclusion of the inspections of \n\nthe property chosen by the affected people for acquisition. The affected people may, coming \n\nfrom  the  collective  resettlements,  return  to  this  modality  even  after  visiting  several \n\nproperties.  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  there  is  no  restriction  in  the  number  of  properties \n\nrecommended for analysis and studies, nor is there a time limit for choosing the definitive \n\nproperty or migrating to another modality. It is important to know these aspects, because \n\nby providing each family with an ample opportunity to be heard concerning their interests \n\nand decision making, the timeframe for the delivery of the resettlements is altered. \n\nIt is further relevant to emphasize that the instrument used to verify these steps was \n\ndeveloped with the participation of the Affected People Technical Advisory Service - Cáritas, \n\nand approved in March 2019 by the 1st Prosecutor of Justice of Mariana.  \n\nAfter  approval  of  the  urban  design  for  the  resettlement  of  Bento  Rodrigues, \n\ndiscussions were held with the community regarding the beginning of meetings with eligible \n\nfamilies  to  develop  their  individual  architectural  projects.  These  discussions  were  held \n\nthroughout the months of March, April and May 2018 and, to this end, the meetings of the \n\nInterdisciplinary / Housing Working Group were used, as well as specific meetings with the \n\n22 \n\n \n \n\fBento Rodrigues Commission, always accompanied by the Technical Advisory - Cáritas and a \n\nrepresentative of the Public Prosecutor's Office. \n\nThe  methodology  created  to  develop  the  architectural  projects  for  the  families' \n\nhouses also relied on a participative and deliberative process. \n\nOs atendimentos às famílias para projeção das moradias foram iniciados em abril de \n\n2019. This methodology establishes a connection with the previous way of life and the future \n\nhousing perspective. The methodology also seeks the necessary habitability for the current \n\ncomposition of the family group that will reside in the house. Thus, the construction of each \n\nhouse  considers  the  project  developed  with  each  family,  ensuring  the  needs  and  the \n\nindividuality of the family nuclei. This methodology was divided into 5 phases: \n\nPhase 1: Knowing: in this phase, families create bonds with the professionals (social \n\nanalyst and architect) who are going to assist the families, get to know the assistance \n\nmodel, establish a meeting agenda, and understand the role of the architect and the \n\nnorms necessary to ensure the quality of the construction. \n\nPhase 2: Remembering: In this stage, families recount to the architect about how the \n\nspace  was  occupied  in  the  original  area  and  through  that  establish  a  spatial  and \n\nfunctional reference for the development of the new house.   \n\nPhase 3: Creating: In this phase the families establish their expectations for the future \n\nand define the program for their new house.  \n\nPhase  4:  Adjusting:  in  this  phase  the  families  adjust  the  project  presented  by  the \n\narchitect, the result of the previous phase.  \n\nPhase 5:  Choosing materials: in this phase the families choose the finishing materials \n\nfor the house.  \n\nThroughout  the  process,  the  Renova  Foundation  has  always  sought to  respect  the \n\ntime and availability that each family group requires to define its project.  \n\n23 \n\n \n \n\fFor the construction phase of the houses, a methodology was also agreed upon in \n\nwhich the families accompany the construction of their houses. They visit the construction \n\nsites in the main execution stages. Whenever requested by families, the Renova Foundation \n\norganizes  an  extemporaneous  visit  to  the  construction  site  and,  on  a  monthly  basis,  the \n\nCommission of Affected People and the technical advisory Cáritas conduct visits to monitor \n\nthe construction work.   \n\nFor collective use projects, communities also participated in the definition of each \n\nproject with over 09 meetings and workshops. In Bento Rodrigues 05 meetings were held, \n\nwhile 04 meetings were held in Paracatu. It is noteworthy that there were several instances \n\nin  which  the  collective  assets  were  or  are  still  under  discussion.  These  are:  conversation \n\nrounds,  meetings  with  public  agencies  (Education  Secretary  and  Health  Secretary), \n\ninformative meetings, Working Group Forums, and meetings with the Archdiocese. \n\nSchools,  ecological  parks,  green  areas,  squares,  health  centers  and  services, \n\nassociation  headquarters,  archaeological  sites,  cemeteries,  and  leisure  and  sports  areas \n\nwere developed through a specific methodology, with the participation of the community \n\nand the public agencies responsible for the operation of these facilities.  \n\nThe  Family  Resettlement  modality,  in  turn,  is  available  to  assist  those  families \n\npreviously associated with collective resettlements and who have opted for this assistance \n\nmodality,  as  well  as  families  from  affected  rural  properties.  In  this  assistance  modality, \n\nfamilies are supported in the search for and acquisition of properties available in the real \n\nestate market. \n\nIn compliance with the provisions of the TTAC and set of Guidelines, the procedures for \n\nthe operationalization of the Family Resettlement by the Renova Foundation were defined, \n\nwhich  were  presented  and  validated  in  the  participative  discussion  forums  with  the  Public \n\nProsecutor's  Office,  the Commission  of  Affected People,  the  affected  communities  and  the \n\nTechnical Advisory - Cáritas.  \n\n24 \n\n \n \n\fThe activities contained in this resettlement modality comprise the period in which \n\nfamilies will be accompanied by the technical team in the search for a property. The stages \n\nof accompanying families in Family Resettlement include:  \n\n  meeting to present the modality;  \n\n  presentation of a real estate database, from which the family can select properties \n\nof interest contained in the database or even brought by the family itself, according \n\nto the family's needs;  \n\n  surveys  and  technical  studies  (habitability,  productive  aptitude,  expertise  and  real \n\nestate  valuation)  of  the  chosen  property,  collection  of  preliminary  documentation \n\nand preparation of the Real Estate Notebooks; \n\n  approval  by  the  family  of  the  Real  Estate  Notebook  that  contains  studies  of  the \n\nchosen property; \n\n  negotiation of the property acquisition by the Renova Foundation; \n\n  definitive adhesion of the family to this assistance modality after the conclusion of \n\nthe commercial agreement; \n\n  acquisition of the property and transfer of ownership to the affected family; \n\n  meetings  with  the  families  to  prepare  individual  architectural  projects  for  the \n\nconstruction and/or remodeling of the properties acquired; \n\n  process to issue licenses and permits for construction; \n\n  execution of the work and supervision by the families; \n\n  delivery of the property to the families and planning to move in up to 3 months after \n\ndelivery, according to the family's desire. \n\nThis  process, until  culminating  with  the property acquisition,  has two  determining \n\ntime variables: the family's resolution regarding the chosen property and the property's land \n\nregularization status. In both cases, there is no control by the Renova Foundation. \n\n25 \n\n \n \n\fConsidering the reconstruction modality in which the family chooses to remain in the \n\noriginal area, as also foreseen in the guidelines, the technical viability of the property must \n\nbe  ensured  and  the  property  must  be  reconstructed  in  such  a  fashion  that  returns  to  a \n\ncondition similar or better than the property in the situation prior to the failure of the Fundão \n\nDam. \n\nAmong  these  stages,  the  implementation  of  the  Environmental  Socioeconomic \n\nAdequacy  Plan  (PASEA)  should  be  emphasized,  which  foresees  both  reparatory  and \n\ncompensatory actions divided in the following order: \n\na.  Property environmental adequacy; \n\nb.  Recovery and incentive to agricultural production; \n\nc.  Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (ATER); \n\nd.  Renovation, reconstruction, and new construction of rural structures. \n\nIV. III. BENTO RODRIGUES COLLECTIVE RESETTLEMENT \n\nThe collective resettlement of Bento Rodrigues has 95% of the infrastructure works \n\nconcluded,  considering  roads,  drainage,  electricity  and  sewage  of  streets.  The  sewage \n\ntreatment  plant,  the  Sagrado  Coração  de  Jesus  bridge,  as  well  as  the  Health  Center,  the \n\nService Center and the Municipal School were also concluded. \n\nRegarding private property construction, 7 (seven) houses were concluded and 72 \n\n(seventy-two) houses are under construction. A total of 114 (one hundred and fourteen) \n\npermits were issued for houses and 18 (eighteen) permits for vacant plots, and 04 permits \n\nfor public assets. \n\nAmong the other public and/or collective use assets, the Renova Foundation has a \n\npermit for  the  works  at the  Assembleia  de Deus  Church.  The  Cemetery project  is  already \n\n26 \n\n \n \n \n\fregistered and awaits permit issuance, and other collective assets are currently in the project \n\ndevelopment phase with the responsible entities, including: São Bento Church and Mercês \n\nChurch (Mariana Archdiocese), headquarters of AHOBERO - Bento Rodrigues Vegetable and \n\nFruit  Association,  Multi-purpose  Sports  Court  and  Soccer  Field,  Archeological  Site, \n\nCommunity Park, Meeting Square, Linear Park, Parish Hall, Central Square. \n\nIV. IV. PARACATU DE BAIXO COLLECTIVE RESETTLEMENT  \n\nAt Paracatu de Baixo, 6 (six) houses are under construction. The construction of the \n\nschool, as well as access roads to the community and to the plots' areas are currently in the \n\nearthworks phase. The plot containment, rainwater drainage culverts, treated water pipeline \n\nand  sewage  network  are  also  in  progress.  Over  60  conceptual  house  designs  have  been \n\nconcluded.  \n\nRegarding collective assets, the School (infant and elementary school), the Advanced \n\nHealth Center and the Service Center already have a permit. The Cemetery and the Soccer \n\nField have been registered and are waiting for the permit issuance. The Community Hall, the \n\nCatholic Church, and the São Vicente de Paula House are in the project development phase \n\nwith the Mariana Archdiocese.  \n\nIV.V. FAMILY RESETTLEMENT \n\nConsidering that the family migration process for family resettlement may occur until \n\nsigning  the  option  term,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  universe  of  families  and  assistance \n\nprovided varies constantly.  \n\nCurrently, 144 families have opted for the Family Resettlement modality, and, of \n\nthese, 57 have acquired real estate properties.   \n\n27 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fIV.VI. RECONSTRUCTION \n\nRegarding  reconstruction,  13  families  are  currently  being  assisted,  of  which  10 \n\nfamilies have concluded and delivered their houses, and the others have conceptual projects \n\napproved and released for construction. \n\nFor  more  information  on  the  matter,  access  the  Renova  Foundation  portal,  at: \n\nhttps://www.fundacaorenova.org/dadosdareparacao/reassentamento-e-infraestrutura/ \n\nIV.VII. ASSISTANCE IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSES  \n\nCurrently, the Renova Foundation provides temporary housing services to families \n\neligible  for  resettlement  due  to  displacement.  This  temporary  assistance  is  provided \n\nthrough payment of rent for a property chosen by the family or the transfer of  financial \n\nresources directly to the affected family, with each family group independently choosing \n\nthe assistance format. \n\nThe temporary assistance also includes payment of the difference in electricity bills, \n\nconsidering the difference in rural vs. urban costs, in addition to payment of amounts related \n\nto  IPTU  (property  tax)  and  water  rates.  The  Renova  Foundation  is  also  responsible  for \n\nensuring  the  habitability  of  the  families  by  providing  furniture  and  appliances,  as  well  as \n\nadaptations/improvements in the transitional houses. \n\nThe execution of precautionary reports and communication about the location of the \n\nproperty  in  risk  areas,  based  on  official  information  from  the  City  Hall,  is  part  of  the \n\nassistance  provided  to  families  when  choosing  the  property  for  temporary  housing.  An \n\nannual  assessment  survey  is  also  conducted  to  map  opportunities  to  improve  temporary \n\nhouse  assistance,  an  activity  that  has  been  temporarily  suspended  due  to  the  COVID \n\npandemic.  \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fV. HEARING AND COMPLAINT MECHANISMS (RELATIONSHIP CHANNELS) \n\nConsidering the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2010), also applicable \n\nto third sector entities such as the Renova Foundation, the assumption of the institution is \n\nto act in dialogue with stakeholders to construct solutions related to the reparation process. \n\nFor this purpose, the institution provides the following dialogue mechanisms and spaces for \n\ndebate: \n\n  Weekly  Hearings:  dialogue  space  to  assist  families  eligible  for  Resettlement  to \n\naddress different aspects of the process. The meetings occur with the participation \n\nof the Affected People Technical Advisory - Cáritas, except in cases in which the family \n\nexpressly opts against such participation. \n\n  Submission  of  Weekly  Agenda:  agenda  with  all  reparation  process  activities \n\nconducted  in  Mariana,  including  negotiations  related  to  families  eligible  for \n\nresettlement in Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu de Baixo and rural properties. The agenda \n\nis forwarded to the Commission of Affected People, Technical Advisory - Cáritas and \n\nthe Public Prosecutor's Office. \n\n  Ombudsman:  The  Ombudsman  is  the  Renova  Foundation's  channel  for  receiving, \n\nrecording  and  investigating  reports  and  complaints  related  to  the  communities \n\naffected by the failure of the Fundão Dam in Mariana (MG). These complaints are \n\nhandled by the Renova Foundation Ombudsman department.  \n\nEmail: ouvidoria@fundacaorenova.org \n\nPhone Number: 0800 721 0717  \n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  Confidential  Channel:  The  Confidential  Channel  receives  reports  on  corporate \n\nrelated topics, related to non-compliance with the code of conduct, internal rules or \n\nlegislation  in  force  by  our  employees,  third  parties  or  subcontractors.

LICENSING PROCESS AND ISSUANCE OF PERMITS  \n\nAccording to Clause 196 of the TTAC, \"the ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES shall expedite \n\nthe  analysis  of  processes \n\ninvolving  acts  related  to  SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL  and \n\nSOCIOECONOMIC PROGRAMS.\" \n\nTherefore,  the  development  of  environmental  studies  and  structuring  of  the \n\nengineering documentation that composed the licensing processes relied on the discussion \n\nand previous analysis of the state and municipal licensing agencies. Thus, when studies and \n\ndocumentation were actually filed, these were already known to the licensing agencies.  \n\nFor  the  implementation  of  houses,  authorization  must  also  be  obtained  through \n\nindividual permits for each family's project, according to municipal legislation. \n\n30 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fThis permit can be obtained from the Mariana City Hall and takes a variable amount \n\nof time, and construction work can only start after the permit has been issued. \n\nVII. REASONS FOR DELAYS UNRELATED TO THE ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE RENOVA \n\nFOUNDATION  \n\nInitially,  in  order  to  synthesize  the  Mariana  resettlement  schedule,  the  following \n\ninfographic is included for better visualization: \n\nIt is worth clarifying that several factors beyond the control of the Renova Foundation \n\ncontributed to partial compliance with the delivery schedule of the resettlements. \n\n31 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fIn  addition  to  the  factors  that  invariably  interfere  with  the  progress  of  the \n\nresettlements,  such  as  (i)  issuance  of  the  Authorization  Document  for  Environmental \n\nIntervention  (\"DAIA\")  for  Paracatu  de  Baixo  by  SEMAD,  issued  only  on  06/18/2019,  (ii) \n\npending conclusion of the registration process conducted by the affected people technical \n\nadvisory services. 2019, (ii) pending conclusion of the registration process conducted by the \n\naffected  people  technical  advisory,  (iii)  pending  definition  of  the  compensation  for  the \n\nresidences  foreseen  in  the  resettlement  guidelines,  (iv)  possibility  of  readjustment  and \n\nallocation of vacant plots indefinitely, (v) variation in climate conditions, (vi) impacts of the \n\nresettlement  guidelines,  which  demand  active  participation  of  affected  people  in  the \n\nhousing projects, as well as action of municipal authorities to issue the necessary licenses, \n\nreinforcing the individualization of the delivery of each house, as explained in detail in Item \n\nV, also not to be ignored (vii) necessity to obtain a new environmental license for the ETE \n\nconstruction in a place different from the original project, (viii) interruption of the works and \n\nreduction of the number of employees in the works due to the sanitary rules  arising from \n\nthe pandemic. \n\nAlthough  the  Renova  Foundation  is  invariably  held  fully  responsible  for  the  delay, \n\nexternal factors totally beyond its control and response capacity are not considered, such as \n\nthe pandemic, among other externalities that directly influence the failure to fully comply \n\nwith the established schedule to deliver the resettlements, impacting the progress of the \n\nworks. \n\nIt  would  not  be  appropriate  to  admit  that  the  Renova  Foundation  should  be \n\nunilaterally held responsible for all delays, without considering external factors, unexpected \n\nand  unrelated  to  its  activities,  attributable  to  third  parties  or  resulting  from  unforeseen \n\ncircumstances or force majeure, as is the case of the Coronavirus pandemic.  \n\n32 \n\n \n \n\fEven  if  the  facts  are  analyzed  as  objectively  as  possible,  the  works  were  literally \n\nsuspended for 3 months due to (i) the necessity to reorganize the workforce, the structures \n\nand  the  logistics  of  the  works  due  to  the  pandemic,  and,  subsequently,  (ii)  illegal  acts \n\npromoted by the Municipality (as specifically highlighted in the next chapter). In addition, \n\nthere are impacts that should be ascertained, such as (iii) the reduction in the work pace due \n\nto a reduction in the effective workforce to 1/3 of the total workforce, which, according to \n\nestimates, impacted the conclusion of the resettlements in 240 days, as well as (iv) problems \n\ninvolving projects interrupted by the affected people and pending issues of permits issued \n\nby the City Hall. \n\nAs  illustrated  in  the  infographic  above,  in  addition  to  all  challenges  imposed  to \n\ncommence the resettlement works, since the choice of host areas, in case of the collective \n\nresettlements more recently the works of the resettlements were interrupted for a period \n\nof  approximately  3  months  -  from  03/21/2020  to  05/04/2020  and  posteriorly  from \n\n05/21/2020  to  06/15/2020  -  due  to  the  necessary  adjustment  of  the  structures  and \n\nworkforce contingent, and, subsequently, as a result of manifestly illegal acts committed by \n\nthe Municipality of Mariana within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nMoreover,  it  must  be  considered  that  these  determinations  imposed  by  the \n\nMunicipality  were  not  isolated  or  punctual  measures.  The  municipality  continues  to \n\ndetermine restrictive measures and even the suspension of activities at the resettlements: \n\non 03/15/2021, the Managing Committee of the Prevention and Contingency Plan for Health \n\nforwarded Official Letter No. 14-2021/CG-COVID-19 to the Renova Foundation, determining \n\nthe suspension of in-person assistance to affected people.  \n\nOn 03/23/2021, forwarded Official Letter No. 17-2021/CG-COVID19, with an express \n\ndetermination to immediately suspend the resettlement activities of Novo Bento, Paracatu \n\n33 \n\n \n \n\fand the construction of houses in the city, that is, once again, the Renova Foundation was \n\ncompelled by the government to suspend the resettlement works. \n\nSeeking to minimize the impacts and consequences of the pandemic that has been \n\nravaging the country for over a year, the Renova Foundation made the difficult decision of \n\nhalting work on the resettlements as of 03/21/2020, so that the pertinent preventive actions \n\nand  the  workforce  could  be  reorganized.  Although  the  continuity  of  the  civil  works  was \n\nauthorized by the State Government in the urban area, the resettlements of Bento Rodrigues \n\nand Paracatu de Baixo are of significant size in the Mariana region and the impacts must be \n\nconsidered. \n\nThe project includes the construction of public infrastructure and hundreds of family \n\nhomes in two communities, whose works demand relevant infrastructure, such as cafeterias \n\nfor  employees,  public  transportation,  and  accommodation,  in  addition  to  the  inevitable \n\ncirculation  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  a  municipality  with  an  estimated  61,288 \n\ninhabitants. \n\nBy March 2020, the Bento Rodrigues resettlement works employed 2,377 workers, \n\nwhile the Paracatu de Baixo resettlement works employed 1,098 workers, for a total of 3,475 \n\nemployees. Employee transportation was provided with a maximum capacity of 44 people, \n\nand  estimates  indicate  that  30%  of  the  workforce  at  the  time  used  the  accommodations \n\nprovided  (1,043  employees).  The  number  of  employees,  added  to  the  performance  of \n\noutsourced companies, circulation, transportation and accommodation of people, could be \n\nthe  perfect  formula  for  that,  sooner  or  later,  serious  problems  would  arise  due  to  the \n\ndissemination of the Coronavirus. For this reason, in order to preserve the health and safety \n\nof employees and the inhabitants of the city in a scenario of extreme insecurity, the works \n\nhad to be halted so that operations could be reorganized.  \n\n34 \n\n \n \n\fNote  that  this  was  not  an  isolated  action  by the  Renova  Foundation,  but  rather  a \n\nnecessity and an act of responsibility in view of the reality experienced in early 2020 and the \n\nlittle information available at the time regarding the health crisis that was emerging and, \n\nunfortunately, remains persistent to this day. Even the Judiciary and the Public Prosecutor's \n\nOffice - entities that provide essential services - had to readjust to remote work methods, \n\nincluding the suspension of procedural terms during 2020 until the work method could be \n\nreformulated. \n\nFaced with a large-scale construction project, temporarily halting work to reorganize \n\nthe  flow  of  employees  is  a  necessary  and  responsible  act  to  protect  the  population  and \n\nemployees. \n\nIn  addition,  the  Municipality  of  Mariana  required,  through  Decree  10,071/2020, \n\ndated  04/30/2020,  the  submission  of  an  Action  Plan  to  those  responsible  for  the \n\ndevelopment of economic activities, services in general, and even essential services provided \n\nin the municipality, according to the municipal strategic plan for the gradual resumption of \n\neconomic activities. The Action Plan was properly submitted by the Renova Foundation and \n\napproved  by  the  Municipal  Commission  for  Issues  Related  to  the  Renova  Foundation \n\n(\"COMAR\") on 05/04/2020. \n\nDespite compliance with all requirements of Decree 10,071/2020 in the Action Plan \n\npresented by the Renova Foundation, and although the construction works had not been \n\ngenerally restricted by the State Government, the Municipality simply prevented employees \n\nfrom  accessing  the  resettlement  works  and  required  the  submission  of  a  Contingency \n\nPrevention Plan, not even provided for in any act issued by Public Authorities. In other words, \n\nwhile  on  the  one  hand  the  State  Government  allowed  for  the  continuation  of  civil \n\nengineering  works,  on  the  other  hand,  the  Municipality  of  Mariana  imposed  much  more \n\nrestrictive and specific measures on the Renova Foundation.  \n\n35 \n\n \n \n\fFurthermore, the municipality conditioned the resumption of resettlements to the \n\nrecovery  of  the  road  that  provides  access  to  Novo  Bento  and  to  the  agreement  of  the \n\nallocation  of  resources  for  the  execution  of  supply  works  and  water  reservoirs  in  that \n\nsubdivision.  All  the  obstacles  and  conditions,  illegal  without  a  doubt,  imposed  by  the \n\nmunicipality, culminated in the resumption of the works only on June 15, 2020. Therefore, \n\nthere were 86 days of total work stoppage due to acts of the Municipality. \n\nFor this reason, the effective workforce contingent at the construction sites had to \n\nbe  reduced  due  to  health  regulations  requiring  social  distancing  and,  consequently, \n\nrestrictions  on  circulation  and  permanence \n\nin  cafeterias,  accommodations,  and \n\ntransportation, among others. In Novo Bento, the contingent was reduced to 1,051 workers, \n\nand in Novo Paracatu, to 537 workers, that is, 1,588 workers out of the 3,475 workers initially \n\nmobilized (less than half, therefore). \n\nThe work stoppage for a period of 3 months not only had an impact on the conclusion \n\nof the resettlements, but the new reality of a reduced workforce contributed to the reduced \n\npace and progress of the work, compared to the period before the pandemic, with other \n\nexpectations. \n\nAnd to ensure that there are no doubts regarding the repeated impositions by the \n\nmunicipality,  it  should  be  noted  that  on  03/15/2021,  the  Managing  Committee  of  the \n\nPrevention  and  Contingency  Plan  for  Health  forwarded  Official  Letter  No.  14-2021/CG-\n\nCOVID19 to the Renova Foundation, with a determination to halt in-person assistance to the \n\naffected people. Then, on March 23, 2021, an Official Letter No. 17-2021/CG-COVID19 was \n\nforwarded,  expressly  determining  the  immediate  halt  of  resettlement  activities  in  Novo \n\nBento, Paracatu and the construction of houses in the city, until March 31, 2021.  \n\nBear in mind that the suspension of assistance to affected people directly impacts the \n\ndevelopment of the resettlements: the participation of the affected community is necessary \n\n36 \n\n \n \n\ffor the approval of all resettlement projects and stages. In addition, although the Renova \n\nFoundation has responded to Official Letter No. 17-2021/CG-COVID19, contrary to what was \n\ndetermined therein, the imposed stoppage of the resettlement works clearly impacts delays \n\nin delivery. \n\nAnother specific point that deserves attention relates to the relocation of the Bento \n\nETE. Despite warnings from the Renova Foundation concerning probable delays that would \n\nfollow such relocation of the Novo Bento Rodrigues ETE, in order to comply with the request \n\nof  the  affected  people,  especially  due  to  the  probable  need  for  a  new  environmental \n\nlicensing process for the execution of works in an area not covered by the licenses previously \n\nobtained; the affected people themselves made the decision to relocate the ETE based on \n\nthe promise from representatives of the State Secretariat for Environment and Sustainable \n\nDevelopment  (\"SEMAD\")  that  a  new  licensing  would  not  be  necessary  and  that  any \n\nbureaucratic adjustments would be simple and expeditious. \n\nAfter the Renova Foundation prepared a new project, on 10/14/2019 a meeting was \n\nheld with SUPPRI to present the land use map of the new ETE area, at which time the agency \n\nconfirmed  that  the  procedure  would  be  concluded  through  an  amendment  to  the \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment. Thus, on 10/25/2019, the Renova Foundation submitted \n\nthe  addendum  request  to  AIA,  upon  presentation  of  the  documentation  requested  by \n\nSUPPRI. \n\nHowever,  at  a  meeting  held  on  12/04/2019,  SUPPRI,  instead  of  the  commitment \n\nmade at the hearing, informed that it would alter the ETE procedure and that environmental \n\nlicensing would be required for the expansion, and not the amendment to AIA as previously \n\nrecommended. On 12/05/2019, SUPPRI inspected the area and, subsequently, the Renova \n\nFoundation started preparing the necessary studies according to the new orientation, and \n\nprovided the protocol to the competent agencies on 02/04/2020. \n\n37 \n\n \n \n\fThe  environmental  license  to  alter  the  location  of  the  ETE  by  SUPPRI  was  only \n\nconcluded on 06/26/2020 (ID 1159065070) and construction work on the ETE commenced \n\non 08/10/2020, with the removal of the local vegetation for the first stage of the project \n\nimplementation phase. There was a significant impact on the ETE construction schedule due \n\nto the reorientation of the licensing process, to an extent where there was a 205-day delay \n\nbetween  the  information  issued  by  SUPPRI  regarding  the  need  for  new  licensing,  on \n\n12/04/2019, and the actual granting of the license, on 06/26/2019. Therefore, there was a \n\n205-day delay compared to the initially expected date to conclude the ETE. \n\nThe  fact  is  that  the  misguidance  of  the  competent  environmental  agencies  at  the \n\njudicial hearing and the shift in posture during the administrative procedures caused delays \n\nin obtaining the necessary licenses to commence work on the Novo Bento Rodrigues ETE, \n\nwhich cannot under any circumstances be attributed to the Renova Foundation. \n\nFurthermore, a decision was issued on 09/22/2020, in the records of compliance with \n\nRuling No. 5002815-45.2019.8.13.0400, which established a term, until December 2020, for \n\nthe formation of new family groups to be served in any resettlement modality separately \n\nfrom their original family groups. \n\nDespite the judicial discussion, the Renova Foundation has started assisting the new \n\nnuclei established until January 2019, and which meet the formation criteria that are not \n\nsubject  to  judicial questioning. To date,  19  assistances  are  in  progress, 7  in the  collective \n\nresettlements and 12 in the family resettlements.  \n\nLikewise, the constant and repeated obstacles presented by the technical advisory \n\nCáritas  Brasileira  on  a  variety  of  issues  should  not  be  ignored,  whether  related  to \n\nadjustments proposed by the Renova Foundation in adapting to the current moment with \n\nremote  assistance,  or to  the  conclusion  of the registration  work,  or during the  assistance \n\nprovided to the affected people. \n\n38 \n\n \n \n\fConsidering that the implementation of the resettlements requires compliance with \n\nthe agreed stages and procedures, and that these require the participation/validation of the \n\nfamilies  in  conjunction  with  the  Technical  Advisory  -  Cáritas,  and  that  the  pandemic  has \n\ncaused adjustments to the work process and continues to impose restrictions on the initially \n\nstructured model, there is certainly an impact on the execution and delivery schedule of the \n\nresettlements. In any case, it is important to state that since the beginning of the COVID-19 \n\npandemic,  the  Renova  Foundation  has  adopted  measures  for  the  continuity  of  the \n\nresettlements,  adapting  and  seeking  alternatives,  considering  the  health  and  safety \n\nprotocols and guidelines provided by authorities.   \n\nSince April 2020, that is, the moment after the beginning of the pandemic, the Renova \n\nFoundation  has  proposed  and  implemented  remote  activities  with  families  and  collective \n\nforums,  aimed  at  continuing  the  services  and,  consequently,  the  delivery  of  the \n\nresettlements.  With  the  challenge  of  maintaining  the  agreed  methodologies,  and \n\nincorporating the virtual implementation, after one (1) year, data is available demonstrating \n\nthe importance of adopting this measure, even if in opposition to the Technical Advisory - \n\nCáritas and the Commission of Affected People (substantiated in documents submitted to \n\nthe Renova Foundation).  \n\nThe  previously  agreed  upon  methodologies,  whether  for  monitoring  the  works, \n\nvisiting  the  plot,  developing  the  conceptual  designs  of  the  houses  and  choosing  finishing \n\nmaterial, signing of terms, etc., began to be offered in a virtual environment, safeguarding \n\nthe liberality of the family in their engagement, the safety of those involved without losing \n\nthe  quality  of  the  services  provided,  and  respecting  the  right  of  the  families  to  be \n\naccompanied by technical advisors. The Renova Foundation also sought measures for the \n\nprovision of equipment (such as tablets), organization of the entire logistics to provide such \n\nservices (provision of links, staff training and remote support to families for better use of \n\n39 \n\n \n \n\fsuch tools), as well as support for Internet access (by paying for Internet services, transferred \n\nto the families, during the period in which the services are provided).  \n\nSome  results  of  such  initiative  reveal  how  much  the  Renova  Foundation  and  the \n\nfamilies eligible for resettlement made an effort to overcome the obstacles posed by the \n\npandemic, whether through the incorporation of virtual methodologies (available exclusively \n\nin the initial moments of the pandemic) or through the resumption of face-to-face activities \n\nin a safe manner and in compliance with government health and safety recommendations \n\n(whenever  possible  and  provided  there  is  agreement  from  the  family),  among  which  we \n\nhighlight the conclusion of 97 conceptual projects, including collective assets, and with 55 \n\nunder  development,  222  terms  signed  and  85  visits  conducted  to  plots  and  construction \n\nsites, 65 of which in a face-to-face format according to the health protocol and 20 virtual \n\nvisits.  \n\nAs  for  on-site  activities,  the  following  measures  were  adopted:  use  of  adequate \n\nenvelopes for sanitization and quarantine of documents forwarded to the family; use of a \n\nvirtual system to sign documents, weekly testing of the team members who interact with \n\nthe  affected  people, availability  of  alcohol  gel  and  masks during  the  on-site  visits,  among \n\nothers.  \n\nCertainly, the current context poses restrictions and, consequently, an impact on the \n\ntimeframe  for  compliance  with  the  obligation  to  deliver  the  resettlements.  Therefore,  all \n\nstakeholders  involved  (Renova  Foundation,  Families,  Technical  Advisory  -  Cáritas  and \n\nCommission) are responsible for strengthening the arrangements proposed to achieve the \n\ndelivery objectives. \n\nAll factors external to the operations of the Renova Foundation hinder the progress \n\nof the resettlement work: (i) still pending conclusion of the registration process conducted \n\nby  the  affected  people  technical  advisory,  (ii)  pending  definition  of  the  housing \n\n40 \n\n \n \n\fcompensation provided for in the resettlement guidelines, (iii) possibility of readjustment \n\nand  allocation  of  vacant  plots  indefinitely,  (iv)  impacts  of  the  approved  resettlement \n\nguidelines to prepare resettlement projects, (v) varying weather conditions, (vi) necessity of \n\nactive participation and approval of the house projects by the affected people themselves, \n\n(vii) approval of projects by the competent municipal agencies, among others. Some of these \n\nfactors are worth highlighting for the purposes of this report. \n\nIt  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  registration  process  conducted  by  Cáritas \n\nBrasileira,  including  phase  1  (application  of  the  form),  has  not  yet  been  concluded  in \n\nMariana. As is known, even though the conclusion of the registration was essential for the \n\ncollection  of  information  related  to  the  resettlement,  the  companies  and  the  Renova \n\nFoundation  needed  to  proceed  with the  projects,  even  though  in  the  course  of  the  work \n\nadjustments had to be made to adapt these projects to the information gathered during the \n\nregistration. \n\nEven from the aspect of serving new families formed after the failure, the conclusion \n\nof  the  registration  is  one  of  the  premises  established  for  the  service,  as  provided  for  by \n\nGuideline No. 2 approved on 02/06/201813 in the records of ACP Mariana. This is a factor \n\nthat is unequivocally external to the actions of the Renova Foundation and that also directly \n\ninfluences the conclusion of the resettlements. \n\nFurthermore,  as  a  result  of  the  widely  participative  and  individualized  process  -  in \n\nwhich  the  affected  parties  are  guaranteed  the  option  for  the  resettlement  method \n\n(collective,  family  or  reconstruction  whenever  applicable),  active  participation  in  the \n\n13 \"2. In respect to the current conformation of the family nuclei, covering cases of separation, new unions, \ndeaths, births and other cases, the Companies, through the Renova Foundation, should assure a property for \neach nucleus, when this is the wish of the family nucleus, observing reasonable and generally accepted criteria, \nrules  for  assessing  the  effective  formation  of  new  family  nuclei,  and  that  such  reality  is  considered  in  the \nregistration\" (g.n.). \n\n41 \n\n \n \n                                       \n\fpreparation and approval of the conceptual projects for the properties, in addition to the \n\nselection of properties for studies and negotiations necessary for the acquisition in case of \n\nfamily resettlements, the process is completely subject to subjective questions, related to \n\nthe  selection  process  of  the  affected  people  and  their  participation  in  the  projects' \n\npreparation, compliance with the established deadline consists of an impossible obligation, \n\nwhich cannot be met by the work of the Renova Foundation alone.  \n\n In addition to bureaucratic matters, climate and sanitary rules, the delivery of each \n\nproperty  depends  upon  the  selection  and  progress  of  each  family's  project,  as  well  as \n\napproval by the City Hall. Please refer to the diagram below: \n\nDespite the fact that the community's resettlement is collective, the participative and \n\nindividualized  process  assured  to  the  affected  people  imposes  disparities  regarding  the \n\nstatus of each residence. The facts are clear: in addition to being unfeasible to impose the \n\ndelivery of all the residences on a single date, since the conclusion of the construction of the \n\n42 \n\n \n \n \n\fresidences  depends  on  the  preparation  and  approval  of  projects  by  the  affected  people \n\nthemselves and by the City Hall. \n\nAll  these  factors  demonstrate  that  it  is  not  reasonable  to  establish  a  date  that \n\nconsiders the delivery of all houses, since projects depend on the affected people, and the \n\nRenova  Foundation  is  not  directly  and  exclusively  responsible  for  not  complying  with  the \n\nestablished timeframes.  \n\nPrecisely  because  the  preparation  and  approval  process  of  the  house  projects  is \n\nindividualized  and  highly  customized,  the  Renova  Foundation  frequently  encounters \n\nsituations in which it is not possible to advance with the family assistance stages, because \n\nsome of these families, in certain situations, demand or impose conditions that they are not \n\nentitled to. There are also situations which, if accepted by the Renova Foundation, imply a \n\nbreach  of  isonomy  in  relation  to  other  services,  which  may  generate  serious  and \n\nirremediable social disparities in the resettlements. On the other hand, there are cases in \n\nwhich the Renova Foundation perceives the possibility of consensus with families, justifying, \n\nin  certain  situations  of  social  vulnerability,  exceptions  to  current  metrics and  procedures, \n\nand understandings involving concepts and requirements of the resettlement guidelines. \n\nSuch cases, for better reference and direction of actions by the Renova Foundation, \n\nare referred to as \"interrupted cases\". As the interruption of assistance is the result of an \n\nact/decision of the family, the numbers that represent \"interrupted cases\" may change - and \n\noften do, due to the dynamics of the assistance - when there is interest and/or possibility for \n\nthe family to continue with the assistance. \n\nInterrupted cases originate from many factors, including, for example, cases in which \n\nthere  is  evident  abuse  of  rights,  to  the  extent  that  action  is  demanded  from  the  Renova \n\nFoundation,  although  it  is  not  even  associated  with  the  resettlement  program.  There  are \n\nseveral other examples. Even though these interrupted cases relate to individual situations, \n\n43 \n\n \n \n\fgiven the dialogue between the resettlement agents, the Renova Foundation endeavors to \n\nharmonize the solutions, so as not to jeopardize other cases in progress. \n\nAs  an  example,  there  are  cases  in  the  collective  resettlement  of  Bento  Rodrigues \n\nwhere some families have peculiar understandings as to the reasonableness of the guideline \n\naddressing  evidence  of  construction  on  undeveloped  plots,  formerly  occupied  by  the \n\nfamilies, and which would justify the delivery of new housing. There is also disagreement \n\nregarding the criteria for the division of plots and identification of property ownership and \n\ncompensation.  \n\nCompensation should be considered as a complementary process to the reparation \n\nof  the  right  to  housing,  and  shall  be  assessed  after  due  comparison  between  the  agreed \n\nobligations and the reparation process. The Renova Foundation acknowledges that the right \n\nto compensation is assured in cases in which the reparation of the affected housing/property \n\ndoes not reach the minimum parameters established in the Guidelines.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that, since there are no specific methodological references to define \n\ncompensation parameters, in 2019 a development process for calculation and calculation \n\nmethodologies was initiated, seeking to reach a consensus with Affected People Technical \n\nAdvisory - Cáritas and the Public Prosecutor's Office. \n\nIn  June  2019  and  July  2020,  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  presented,  in  court,  a \n\nproposal for a methodology developed by the Affected People Technical Advisory - Cáritas. \n\nSince there is no consensus between the parties, this topic is now discussed in court. Among \n\nthe  compensations  under  discussion,  the  following  are  included  I)difference  in  plot  area: \n\nwhen the plot received by the family is less than the minimum 250m² area (established by \n\nGuideline)  or  the  area  verified  on  the  original  property;  II)difference  in  plot  front  length: \n\nwhen the front length (front of the plot) is less than that verified on the original property or \n\n44 \n\n \n \n\fless  than  the  12m  established  by  municipal  legislation;  III)slope:  when  the  slope  of  the \n\nresettlement plot is greater than that found on the original property. \n\nThe Technical Advisory - Cáritas also presents other types of compensation, which \n\nwere not subject to agreement:  \n\n• \n\nloss of neighborhood: the rearrangements and readjustments of the plots in \n\nthe  collective  resettlements  do  not  mean  an  effective  loss  of  neighborhood,  since  the \n\nfamilies  remain  in  the  same  community  and,  therefore,  there  is  no  disruption  of  the \n\ncommunity relations established at the origin. As for the Family Resettlement, compensation \n\ndoes  not  apply  as  this  is  a  free  choice  made  by  the  affected  people  themselves  in  their \n\nprocess of reparation of the right to housing in an alternative context of moving to another \n\ncommunity. \n\n• \n\nloss of access to water sources: Access to treated water is ensured both by \n\nthe  infrastructure  built  for  the  collective  resettlements  and  by  the  assessment  of  the \n\nproperties acquired by the Family Resettlement.  \n\n• \n\nloss  of  agricultural  aptitude:  the  productive  restructuring  process  includes \n\nactivities that contribute to the adaptation of the affected properties for better use by the \n\naffected people. During this process, the resumption and increase of productive activities on \n\nthe properties acquired for collective and family resettlements will be ensured, as well as \n\nthe environmental recovery of the affected properties. \n\nFurthermore, there are interrupted cases due to peculiarities/vulnerabilities of the \n\nfamilies  involving  inheritance  and  succession  issues.  There  are  also  cases  in  which  it  is \n\nimpossible to move forward with the family's project due to repeated divergences expressed \n\nby the families with respect to the registration prepared by Cáritas Brasileira. \n\n45 \n\n \n \n\fRegarding  the  Paracatu  de  Baixo  collective  resettlement,  there  are,  so  far,  cases \n\ninvolving disagreements for the location of the plot, dissatisfaction with other programs of \n\nthe  Renova  Foundation,  and  repeated  disagreements  with  Cáritas  Brasileira,  expressed \n\nregarding the family's registration. \n\nWith regard to family resettlement, assistance is also interrupted, for example, due \n\nto disagreements over succession, disagreement over the size of the plot, and disagreement \n\nover the sale by the affected individual of both the plot acquired in his name and the future \n\nright to housing granted by the Renova Foundation. \n\nDespite  all  the  impacts  resulting  from  external  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the \n\nCompanies  and  the  Renova  Foundation,  with  regard  to  the  Bento  Rodrigues  collective \n\nresettlement, work on the following public facilities was concluded: (i) municipal school, (ii) \n\nhealth and services center, (iii) earthworks and containments on 103 properties, (iii) public \n\nroad grading, (iv) public lighting, (v) rainwater drainage, (vi) sewage collection network and \n\n(vii) sewage treatment plant. Furthermore, of the 213 houses currently planned for collective \n\nresettlement14, 9 have been concluded and 36 are under construction. \n\nRegarding  the  Paracatu  de  Baixo  collective  resettlement,  especially  due  to  the \n\ndifferences between the main timeframes to start construction work compared to the Bento \n\nRodrigues collective resettlement - highlighting, as differentiating factors, the area selection \n\nby the affected people and DAIA issuance only on 06/18/2019 -, the status of the works is at \n\na different stage, which reinforces the need for segmentation of the delivery term.  \n\nTo date, the following works have been concluded: (i) deep drainage of Area 1 (the \n\narea around Praça Santo Antônio) and Rua Monsenhor Horta, (ii) containment between the \n\n14 This number varies, as there may be changes in the option of the affected people regarding the reparation \nmodality to the right to housing, for example, migration from collective resettlement to family resettlement \n(assisted purchase). \n\n46 \n\n \n \n                                       \n\fPermanent Preservation Areas and Area 1 and Rua Monsenhor Horta, (iii) surface drainage, \n\nas well as the works (iv) of the municipal school, (v) access roads to Novo Paracatu, (vi) street \n\nlayouts. Furthermore, of the 86 houses and 14 vacant plots currently planned as part of the \n\ncollective resettlement, the foundations of 6 houses have been concluded, and work is  in \n\nprogress. \n\nIn  addition,  it  is  important  to  note  that,  to  date,  138  families  have  chosen  family \n\nresettlement (assisted purchase of property outside the collective resettlement, according \n\nto the preference of the affected family nucleus), thus, 57 properties have been acquired; of \n\nthese, 53 require construction or renovation before delivery to the family nucleus and 4 are \n\nvacant  plots,  which  also  require  projects,  simplified  licenses  and  construction  work  to  be \n\ndelivered. In this sense, the works on 6 properties have been concluded and the works on 2 \n\nproperties are nearing conclusion. Also in the family resettlement, there is 1 property where \n\nconstruction work has been started after the respective location was chosen by the family \n\ngroup  and  acquired  by  the  Renova  Foundation.  Finally,  7  properties  were  rebuilt  and \n\ndelivered to the affected families. \n\n For better visualization of the public assets already concluded, please refer to the \n\nphotographs of the ETE and the school and sports gymnasium in the Novo Bento collective \n\nresettlement: \n\n47 \n\n \n \n\fAs shown, although the resettlements have not been fully completed, there \n\nis no inertia on the part of the Companies and the Renova Foundation in complying \n\nwith  the  obligation  that  would  justify  the  full  application  of  the  fine.  Part  of  the \n\nhouses have been concluded and delivered, as well as much of the public assets in \n\nNovo Bento Rodrigues, and the works in Novo Paracatu de Baixo are well underway. \n\n48 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fVIII. CONCLUSION \n\nConsidering  the  aforementioned,  the  FOUNDATION  believes  to  have  provided  the \n\nnecessary clarifications required to better understand the current status of the resettlement \n\nprogram, taking into account the results already obtained, as well as the challenges  yet to \n\nbe overcome.  \n\nIt should be noted that, while the resettlement works are not concluded, the affected \n\nfamilies  can  remain  in  temporary  housing  rented  by  the  Renova  Foundation,  which \n\nguarantees to these families the human right to decent housing, according to national and \n\ninternational human rights legislation.  Therefore, there is no disrespect of this right by the \n\nFoundation. \n\nFor  more  information  on  the  matter,  access  the  Renova  Foundation  portal,  at: \n\nhttps://www.fundacaorenova.org/dadosdareparacao/reassentamento-e-infraestrutura/ \n\nIn  conclusion,  the  FOUNDATION  is  available  to  provide  further  clarification  on  all \n\nprograms and actions that have been adopted, always ensuring the right to information and \n\nparticipation  of  the  affected  people  and  civil  society  in  the  process  to  repair  the  impacts \n\nresulting from the failure of the Fundão Dam, and reiterates the commitment to implement \n\nall possible actions for the most expeditious recovery and reparation of the impacts resulting \n\nfrom the failure of the Fundão Dam. \n\n__________________________                                ________________________ \n\nChristiana Galvão Ferreira de Freitas                         Raineldes Agda Alves de Melo \n\nHuman Rights Manager                                    \n\nResettlement Social Manager \n\n49 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\fMay 3, 2021 \n\nMr. Mauricio Lazala \nAssociate Director \nMs. Marina Novaes  \nBrazil Researcher & Representative \nBusiness and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) \n\nDear Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, \n\nVale  SA  (“Vale”)  hereby  provides  clarification  on  the  information  contained  in  the  Report \n“ATRASOS  - Relatório  de  entrega  dos  reassentamentos  -  Mariana/MG” (“DELAYS  -  Report  on \nDelivery of Resettlements”) (“Report”), released in February 2021 by the Commission of People \nAffected by the Fundão Dam in Mariana (CABF) and Technical Advisory at Cáritas Regional Minas \nGerais. \n\nVale clarifies that its management is based on the respect, awareness, and promotion of Human \nRights,  as  well  as  the  prevention  of  potential  adverse  impacts  and,  when  necessary,  the \nmitigation  and  remediation  of  those  impacts.

Também \nreconhece  que  o  progresso  nos  reassentamentos  em  Mariana/MG  -  Brasil  tem  sido  mais  lento  do  que  o \nprevisto, e continua dedicada a apoiar a Fundação Renova no cumprimento desta tarefa chave. \n\nAproveitamos a oportunidade para reforçar que: \n\n  Um  dos  programas  sociais  prioritários  da  Fundação  Renova  é  a  realocação  e  reconstrução  das \ncomunidades de Bento Rodrigues e Paracatu de Baixo, em Mariana/MG, e Gesteira, em Barra Longa/MG. \nUma chave para o sucesso desse programa é a participação dos membros das comunidades atingidas, \nseus  assessores  técnicos,  procuradores  do  Estado,  líderes  municipais,  agentes  reguladores  e  outras \npartes interessadas. \n\n  O  processo  de  reassentamento  coletivo  envolve  o  desenho  de  novos  distritos  em  terrenos  que  foram \nescolhidos pela comunidade, para ficar o mais próximo possível do layout anterior. O processo requer \natender  aos  desejos  e  necessidades  das  famílias  e  comunidades,  ao  mesmo  tempo  que  atende  aos \nrequisitos legais, normativos e de licenciamentos.  \n\n  Cada família está projetando a sua própria casa, individualmente, com a ajuda de arquitetos treinados \n\npara traduzir as expectativas familiares.  \n\n  As comunidades atingidas em Mariana são assessoradas pela Cáritas Regional Minas Gerais (assistência \ntécnica  escolhida  por  elas)  desde  2016.  Cada  etapa,  desde  então,  foi  acompanhada  por  cerca  de  30 \nassessores independentes que reportam diretamente às comunidades atingidas e ao Ministério Público. \n\nBHP Group Limited ABN 49 004 028 077, BHP Group Plc. registration number 3196209 and their respective subsidiaries are members of the BHP Group.  \nThe BHP Group is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  Todas as famílias com direito a este atendimento estão  residindo em imóveis alugados pela Fundação \n\nRenova, a maioria delas em Mariana/MG.  \n\n  Em  Bento  Rodrigues,  onde  são  esperadas  o  reassentamento  de  202  famílias,  foram  concluídas  as \nconstruções da escola pública, centro de saúde e serviços e estação de tratamento de  esgoto. Outros \nprédios públicos e infraestrutura estão em construção e, em abril de 2021, 95% das obras de infraestrutura \nestavam concluídas incluindo estrada de acesso, arruamentos, redes de drenagem, eletricidade, rede de \nágua e esgoto. Até abril de 2021, do total de 2101 casas a serem construídas, sete foram concluídas e \noutras  72  estão  em  construção,  em  diferentes  estágios  (em  alguns  casos,  as  famílias  pediram  para \ninterromper  o  seu  processo  por  razões  e  em momentos  diversos).  Cerca  de  160  projetos  de  casas  já \nforam  protocolados  na  Prefeitura  para  emissão  de  alvarás  individuais  para  início  de  construção,  após \naprovação das famílias, e 114 alvarás já foram emitidos. \n\n  Em  abril  de  2021,  estavam  em  andamento  obras  de  infraestrutura  e  prédios  públicos  em  Paracatu  de \nBaixo  e  seis  das  842  casas  planejadas  estão  em  construção.  Paracatu  também  sofreu  algumas \ninterrupções  na  construção  de  casas.  A  infraestrutura  de  Paracatu  de  Baixo  encontra-se  em  estágio \navançado, com execução de terraplenagem de vias de acesso e áreas de loteamentos, contenções, obras \nde drenagem pluvial e adutora de água tratada. As escolas de Educação Infantil e Fundamental estão em \nconstrução. Mais de 60 projetos conceituais foram concluídos e, ao todo, são esperadas 91 famílias em \nParacatu de Baixo.  \n\n  Além desses reassentamentos coletivos, 13 famílias da área rural optaram por reconstruir suas casas na \n\npropriedade anterior, e 10 casas foram reconstruídas e entregues às famílias (até abril de 2021). \n\n  Um  total  de  1443  famílias  optaram  por  não  aderir  ao  reassentamento  coletivo  de  sua  comunidade  de \norigem, em Mariana/MG. A Fundação Renova atende a estas famílias e já providenciou a aquisição de \n57  imóveis.  Destes,  19  imóveis  serão  reformados,  34  lotes  serão  para  construção  de  casas  e  quatro \nterrenos sem edificações (até abril de 2021). \n\n  O  progresso  tem  sido  mais  lento  do  que  o  previsto,  principalmente  devido  a  atrasos  no  processo  de \nlicenciamento  do  município,  demora  na  aprovação  de  seus  projetos  individuais  por  algumas  famílias, \nbaixo desempenho das empreiteiras contratadas, e sobretudo, aos impactos da pandemia de COVID-19 \nque obrigou a suspensão das obras por dois meses, seguido por uma redução de 30% da capacidade da \nmão de obra desde então. Os números de trabalhadores na obra têm flutuado dependendo da situação \nda expansão ou retração das infecções por COVID-19 na área. Devido à intensificação da pandemia no \nBrasil,  este  número  de  trabalhadores  segue  reduzido.  O  retorno  total  aos  números  regulares  de \nprofissionais em campo e à capacidade máxima de construção é incerto, pois depende da evolução da \npandemia, protocolos de segurança implementados para prevenir a exposição ao COVID-19 no local, e \nquaisquer restrições impostas pelas autoridades na região. A situação da pandemia no Brasil é conhecida \npor ser uma das mais desafiadoras do mundo.  \n\nMais detalhes do complexo processo de reassentamento, que vai além da construção de cada uma das casas, \npodem  ser  encontrados  em      Reassentamento  e  Infraestrutura  :  Fundação  Renova  (fundacaorenova.org), \ntodos  podem  acompanhar  o  andamento  das  obras. \nincluindo  um \n\nvirtual”  onde \n\n“tour \n\nAgradecemos  o  diálogo  contínuo  com  o  Centro  de  Informação  sobre  Empresas  e  Direitos  Humanos  em \nassuntos de suma importância como este.

BHP \nrecognises progress in the resettlements in Mariana /MG  - Brazil has been slower than anticipated and  we \ncontinue to be dedicated to supporting Renova Foundation on this key deliverable. \n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to reinforce that: \n\n  One of Fundação Renova’s priority social programs is the relocation and rebuilding of the communities \nof Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo in Mariana/MG, and Gesteira in Barra Longa/MG. A key to \nthe  success  of  this  program  is  the  participation  of  affected  community  members,  their  technical \nadvisers, State Prosecutors, municipal leaders, regulators and other interested parties.  \n\n  The process of collective resettlement involves designing new towns on land that has been chosen by \nthe community, to be as close as possible to the previous layout. It requires attending to the wishes \nand needs of the families and communities, while also meeting permitting and legal requirements.  \n\n  Each family is designing their own house, one by one, assisted by architects trained to translate the \n\nfamilies’ expectations.  \n\n  The affected communities in Mariana are assisted by  Cáritas Regional Minas Gerais (the technical \nassistance  chosen  by  them)  since  2016.  Each  step  since  then  was  followed  by  approximately  30 \nindependent assistants reporting directly to the affected communities and prosecutor.  \n\nBHP Group Limited ABN 49 004 028 077, BHP Group Plc. registration number 3196209 and their respective subsidiaries are members of the BHP Group.  \nThe BHP Group is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  All the families entitled to this assistance are accommodated in houses rented by Fundação Renova, \n\nmost of them in Mariana/MG.  \n\n \n\nIn Bento Rodrigues, where 202 families are expected, the public school, Health and Services Centre \nand Sewage Treatment Station have been completed. Other public buildings and infrastructure are \nunder  construction  and,  as  of  April  2021,  95%  of  the  infrastructure  works  are  completed,  including \nroads, drainage, electricity, water, and sewage networks. As of April 2021, of the 2101 total homes to \nbe built, seven have been completed with 72 others  at varying stages of construction (note, that in \nsome cases, families have asked to interrupt their process in different stages and for different reasons). \nAround  160  house  projects  have  been  filed  at  the  City  Hall  seeking  individual  permits  to  start \nconstruction, and 114 have been granted.  \n\n  By April 2021, construction of infrastructure and public buildings in Paracatu de Baixo was under way \nand six of the 842 planned houses are under construction. Paracatu has also seen some interruptions \nin house construction.  Paracatu de Baixo’s infrastructure is at an advanced stage, with the execution \nof earthworks for access roads and areas of lots, containments, works for storm drainage and treated \nwater  adductor.  The  Kindergarten  and  Middle  schools  are  under  construction.  More  than  60 \nconceptual projects have been completed, and in total, 91 families are expected in Paracatu de Baixo. \n\n \n\nIn addition to these community resettlements, 13 families from the rural area chose to rebuild their \nhouses on their previous property, and 10 houses have been rebuilt and delivered to the families (as \nat April 2021). \n\n  A total of 1443 families have chosen not to join the collective resettlement of their previous community \nin  Mariana. Fundação Renova is assisting them and  57  properties  have been  purchased for these \nfamilies, which 19 properties are to renovate, 34 houses to be build and four vacant lots (as of April \n2021). \n\n  Progress  has  been  slower  than  anticipated  primarily  due  to  delays  in  the  municipality  permitting \nprocess,  community  members  delaying  sign-off  for  their  designs,  poor  performance  of  contractors, \nCOVID-19 impacts which suspended works for two months followed by a reduced workforce at 30% \ncapacity thereafter. Workforce numbers have since fluctuated depending on the COVID-19 situation \nin the area, but have remained low. The full return to regular numbers of field staff and construction \ncapacity  is  uncertain  and  dependent  on  the  evolving  nature  of  the  pandemic,  safety  protocols \nimplemented to prevent exposure to COVID-19 on site and any restrictions imposed by authorities in \nthe region. The pandemic situation in Brazil is  well-known to be  one of the most challenging in the \nworld.  \n\nMore details of the complex resettlement process, which goes beyond building the customized houses, can \nbe found in RESETTLEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE: Renova Foundation (fundacaorenova.org), \nincluding a “virtual tour” where everyone can follow the construction progress. \n\nWe appreciate our ongoing dialogue with the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre on these \ncritically important matters. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you wish to discuss further.  \n\nYours sincerely, \n\nIvan Apsan & Simon Duncombe \nVP External Affairs Brazil & VP Non-Operated Joint Ventures Brazil \n\n1 Please note that this numbers change frequently as the families can change their option on where they want to be resettled. \n2 See note above. \n3 See note above. \n\n2"}

For us, working on the ground in the country for the past 30 years, it has been evident \nwhat remarkable change the textile industry has gone through thanks to the Accord, and how \nimportant it is for these positive developments to continue. We will always collaborate closely with \ntrade unions, suppliers and other brands to find a long-term solution. To make sure the Accord \nbecomes a sustainable industry solution, with equal representation by trade unions, the industry and \ninternational brands, we are now focusing on strengthening the RSC. \n\nH&M Group continues to support clear accountability for brands and are willing to sign a one-to-\none legally binding agreement enforceable on us as a brand. However, since a majority of all \ninternational brands must be onboard for industry-wide change to happen, we are working \non  creating a solution together with the industry and trade unions that welcomes all brands, that \ncommit to adhere to agreed standards and protocols on building, fire and electrical safety, to \nparticipate.   \n\nRegardless of any future decision about organisation or governance of the Accord, our position on \nand commitment to this extremely important area will stand. \n\nMay 20, 2021 \n\nWe are, and remain, strongly committed to continued systematic efforts to ensure that further \nimprovements are made, in Bangladesh and other markets in regards tofire, electrical and building \nsafety. Working on the ground in Bangladesh, it has been evident to us that the work done within the \nAccord has made a significant and positive impact on workers’ safety.  \n\nWhen the transition Accord was signed in 2018, it was agreed by signatory brands and trade unions \nthat after the agreement ends in May 31, 2021, work will be handed over to a national regulatory \nbody who would take over the work thereafter. As part of this transition, in May 2020, the Accord \noperations in Bangladesh were transferred to the then newly founded RMG Sustainability Council \n(RSC). This is a Bangladesh not-for-profit organization with tripartite governance structures and equal \nrepresentation on the board of directors of international brands, trade unions and suppliers. This RSC \nadopted all Accord standards, compliance, protocols and articles.  \n\nWe are committed to supporting the RSC, to continue driving improvements in safety standards in \nthe entire textile industry in Bangladesh, not only the factories producing for H&M Group. The \nunions also have an extremely important role in driving this agenda through the RSC, where they are \nan equal partner with Brands and the industry.      \n\nIn addition to our commitments to the RSC, we understand the ask that the Unions have with regards \nto direct brand accountability. Our Global Framework Agreement with IndustriALL and IF Metall is \nbased on the shared belief that good industrial relations and equal partnerships are crucial for lasting \nimprovements for garment workers. We, as part of the brand negotiating team, are in close dialogue \nwith IndustriAll and UNI on how to enable this with relations to a follow-on agreement of the \ntransition Accord.  We remain committed to finding a solution.  We have a strong common ground \nhere with unions, and agree on key principles of accountability, tri-partite structures and local \ninclusion. \n\nGeneral Information \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fH&M Group only produces in factories that have been reviewed by the Accord. When we start \nworking with factories, fire exits, fire alarms and fire extinguishers are examples of fundamental \nsafety mechanisms that must be in place in order for them to be allowed to produce goods for H&M \nGroup.  \n\nThe numbers referred to in the report “Unfinished business” do not mean that factories lack these \nsafety mechanisms. It can rather refer to the fact that these mechanisms are in need of maintenance \nor do not have adequate size according to international safety standards. Some of the issues stated \nin the report have already been corrected, but due to lockdowns and fewer factory visits because of \nCOVID-19, the Accord has not been able to verify these corrections. We will of course support our \nsuppliers to correct pending matters. Regardless of any future decision about organisation or \ngovernance of the Accord, our position on and commitment to this extremely important area will \nstand. \n\nGeneral Information"}

Our human rights approach is based upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and \nthe UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  \n\nOur Human Rights Policy also states that we acknowledge and respect Indigenous Peoples’ connections to \nlands and waters, consistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).  \n\nOur Group-wide Communities and Social Performance Standard establishes specific requirements for our \nbusinesses concerning Indigenous Peoples.

We \nwant to make a positive impact on society, contributing to a more diverse and inclusive world. Shell is \ncommitted to respecting human rights as set out in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and \nthe International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We \nhave an integrated approach to human rights that is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business \nand Human Rights. This approach is embedded in our policies and processes which are applicable to all \nemployees and contractors, allowing us to manage human rights within our ways of working. \n\nShell supports voluntary codes such as OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, IFC Environmental \nand Social Standards, UN Global Compact 10 Principles. \nOur operations in certain parts of the world affect indigenous peoples who hold specific rights for the \nprotection of their cultures, traditional ways of life and special connections to lands and waters. In some \ncountries, for example in Canada, Australia, Bolivia and Philippines, indigenous peoples hold specific \nrights recognised by law that protect their cultures and ways of life. In line with Shell’s General Business \nPrinciples, and in support of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, our approach is to \ncontinue seeking the support and agreement of indigenous peoples potentially affected by our projects. \nWe do this through mutually agreed, transparent and culturally appropriate consultation and impact \nmanagement processes. It requires open dialogue, good faith negotiations, and, where appropriate, the \ndevelopment of agreements that address the needs of indigenous peoples. \n\nWe recognise the principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), as interpreted by the \nInternational Finance Corporation Performance Standards, as a safeguard for indigenous peoples’ rights. \nWe developed a public position statement on FPIC and believe our approach is consistent with the \napplication of this principle, while respecting the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Shell is \nalso an active member of the FPIC Solutions Dialogue steering committee. It is an initiative to develop \npractical guidance and to support FPIC community processes relating to mining and oil and gas projects. \n\nA few recent examples of our engagements with Indigenous communities around the world include:  \n\n• \n\n• \n\nIn Bolivia, we are working with the Weenhayek indigenous people and a local non-governmental \norganisation to develop a social investment project that aims to help preserve cultural practices \nand provide community benefits. This work includes improving food security and supporting \nincome-generating projects for more than 1,000 community members. The Weenhayek people \nlive and work in areas near our La Vertiente gas operations, which are being transferred to the \ngovernment. \n\nIn 2020, we announced a joint reforestation project with Tŝilhqot’in National Government in a \nregion of Western Canada affected by recent wildfires. Shell-funded tree planting will be \nmanaged by Central Chilcotin Rehabilitation, a Tŝilhqot’in forestry company. The project aims to \nplant around 840,000 trees in affected areas that have not regenerated naturally. Potential \nbenefits of the project include indigenous employment opportunities and forest ecosystem \nrejuvenation. It may also lead to opportunities to generate carbon credits in future. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f• \n\nIn Argentina, we continued our extensive engagement sessions with indigenous people, as well \nas local farmers and nearby communities, in the Vaca Muerta shales basin in Neuquén. This \nincluded incorporating community feedback into our operational plans and schedules. We also \nhelp indigenous community members improve agricultural production through technical \nassistance and our employee volunteer programme. Through this outreach, we have managed \nto develop strong relationships with the community in the basin, avoiding impact on other \npeople and disruption to our activities. \n\nIn addition to this, we have ongoing engagements with indigenous communities in Canada, Australia, \nRussia and other countries."}

We welcome  the opportunity to provide these comments.       As \nrequested in your email, our comments focus on the recommendations for enterprises set out on \npages 58-59 of the Report.  We appreciate and commend the manner in which the Business and \nHuman Rights Resource Centre has collaboratively approached feedback on this important work.  \n\nPolicy Commitments and Benefit-Sharing \n\nMost of our operations are located on or near lands traditionally owned by or under the customary \nuse  of  Indigenous  peoples.  We  embrace  the  opportunity to  establish  respectful, long -lasting \npartnerships through which we  seek meaningful engagement, trust, mutual benefit and genuine \nunderstanding of the views and interests of Indigenous peoples. \n\nOur approach to working  with  Indigenous peoples is  underpinned  by our global policies, which \ninclude our Human Rights Policy Statement, the Our Requirements for Community Standard, the \nIndigenous Peoples Policy Statement and the Indigenous Peoples Strategy.  \n\nOur Indigenous Peoples Strategy has four pillars: \n\n  Governance:  Indigenous  peoples  will  derive  significant  and  sustainable benefit  from  BHP \noperations through the effective governance and management of land access, cultural heritage \nmanagement, agreement making and benefit distribution processes. \n\n  Economic  empowerment: BHP  will  contribute to  the  economic empowerment  of  Indigenous \npeoples through investment, which provides opportunities for employment, training, procurement \nand Indigenous enterprise support. \n\n  Social and cultural support: BHP will contribute to improved quality of life for Indigenous peoples \nthrough voluntary social  investment, support for  reinforcement and promotion of  Indigenous \nculture and building the Indigenous cultural awareness of our workforce.  \n\n  Public  engagement: BHP  will  contribute to  specific  initiatives,  programs  and  public  policy \nprocesses,  which  advance  the  interests  of  Indigenous  peoples  consistent  with  the  BHP \nIndigenous Peoples Policy Statement. \n\nAs part of our work in furtherance of our Indigenous Peoples Strategy, we are continually engaging \nwith Indigenous peoples, their representative bodies and other organisations working in Indigenous \naffairs to  strengthen our partnerships.   In  Australia, we  also  work  to  apply BHP’s  policies and \npractices in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander pe oples in a manner consistent with our \nIndigenous Peoples Strategy through our fifth Reconciliation Action Plan.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fHuman Rights Processes \n\nThe recommendations in the Report refer to  the importance of  human rights due diligence and \nhuman rights impact assessments (HRIA).   We believe that HRIAs  are an important mechanism \nthrough which we can identify, seek to prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, including \nin relation to Indigenous peoples.  HRIAs  and other human rights due diligence also help BHP  to \nidentify new  opportunities to respect human rights and support dialogue with stakeholders about \nBHP’s human rights impacts and contributions.  \n\nOur policies and standards require operated assets to complete a HRIA  at least every three years, \nand also to review HRIAs whenever there are changes that may affect the impact profile.  All HRIAs \nmust  include  engagement  with  rights  holders  and  stakeholders to  enable  a  more  complete \nunderstanding of any actual or potential human rights threats and opportunities.  \n\nFree Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) \n\nOur approach to FPIC  is set out in BHP’s  Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement and Indigenous \nPeoples Strategy.   The measures envisaged in  this  approach include social and environmental \nimpact  assessments for  projects affecting Indigenous peoples, seeking to agree and document \nengagement and consultation plans with  potentially impacted Indigenous peoples , and seeking, \nthrough  good  faith  negotiation,  to  reach  agreements  with  Indigenous   peoples  which  deliver \nsustainable improvements in their economic, social and cultural wellbeing.  \n\nIn  relation to  agreement making, we  support the view  that  agreement-making processes should \ninclude efforts to seek to ensure that the conditions to facilitate free, prior and informed consent of \nIndigenous peoples are in place. This includes rights-centred agreements and dispute resolution \nmechanisms, adequate time and resourcing, freedom from undue pressures,  and the assurance of \nIndigenous peoples’ participation through their own representative institutions.  \n\nWe recognise that the concepts and application of FPIC are a critical and dynamic space, and that \nFPIC  is not a static concept. We are engaging in conversations with the Indigen ous peoples on \nwhose country we  operate to better understand how we can work together to ensure that FPIC  is \nachieved and verifiable at each stage of our operations, from mine planning to operations to closure. \n\nGeneral observations \n\nWe endeavour to treat all stakeholders with respect, and to establish open, honest relationships with \nthem built on trust.  This helps us achieve a clear understanding of the context and impacts of our \nactivities  and  informs  how  we  can  make  a  meaningful  contribution  to  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  We recognise that our activities impact on Indigenous peoples and we are committed \nto working together to ensure BHP  is  an enabling partner with Indigenous peoples and that we \npositively contribute to the realisation of the rights of Indigenous peoples.  Central to this are the \nvoices of Indigenous peoples connected to the regions where we work.   We support the ambitions \nof Indigenous peoples to have a greater voice in the discussions and decisions that affect and are \nimportant to them at a local and national level. \n\nWe  have also observed that the employment, procurement, royalties and other socio -economic \nactivities from resources development, if effectively delivered, are powerful mechanisms to enable \nagency and self-determination.   In turn, we  believe that  our organisation is enhanced when it  is \nproperly informed by the views of the Indigenous people who hold rights in relation to our operati ons.   \n\nFor  more  information  on  BHP’s  Policies  as  they  relate  to  Indigenous  peoples,  please  visit: \nhttps://www.bhp.com/sustainability/community/indigenous-peoples/.  \n\n \n \n \n \n\fWhile we are proud of our progress in this space, we  recognise that there is always more that we \ncan do, and that processes such as these and organisations such as yours are making an important \ncontribution to the standards that are rightly evolving in this space.  \n\nWe thank the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre again for the opportunity to comment.  \nIf you would like further information in relation to these matters, please let us know. \n\nGeorge Wright.  \n\nGroup Global Corporate Affairs Officer"}

Para  garantir  a \ncontinuidade operacional, tendo a mineração sido considerada atividade essencial, a empresa \nestá seguindo  as recomendações das  autoridades  de  saúde,  como  a  Organização Mundial  da \nSaúde  (OMS),  com  absoluto  rigor.  Entre  as  principais  medidas  que  a  Vale  adotou  estão:  o \ndistanciamento  social,  atenção  médica  imediata  e  a  realização  da  testagem  em  massa,  que \npermite \nidentificar  rapidamente  pessoas  que  tiveram  contato  com  o  vírus  e  estão \nassintomáticas. Ao seguir o protocolo da OMS e tomar as medidas corretas, a Vale contribui de \nforma relevante no enfrentamento à COVID-19, incluindo nas cidades onde está presente, o que \nse  tornou  uma  prioridade  decorrente  de  dois  pilares  em  nossa  estratégia:  Segurança  e \nExcelência Operacional e um Novo Pacto com a Sociedade. \n\nA  fim  de  enfrentar  os  desafios  trazidos  pela  pandemia  da  COVID-19,  com  responsabilidade, \ndisciplina e senso de urgência, estabeleceu-se um plano de resposta a crise, com processos e \nações que priorizam a saúde e a segurança de empregados e comunidades dos territórios onde \na  empresa  atua.  O  procedimento  interno  determina  como  as  ações  da  empresa  devem  ser \npautadas  na  mitigação  a  transmissão  da  COVID-19  em  suas  operações  e,  por  extensão,  as \ncomunidades  locais  nas  operações  e  tem  como  objetivos  chaves:    proteger  a  saúde  dos \nempregados – próprios e terceiros e comunidades; evitar infecção por SARS-CoV-2 nas unidades \nda Vale em todo o mundo; e garantir a continuidade operacional segura: prover as condições \nnecessárias para que um efetivo mínimo possa garantir a produção segura. \n\nNesse sentido, a Vale adotou três níveis de linha de defesa contra o vírus da COVID-19 nas suas \noperações.  \n\nO primeiro nível é o Checklist de Saúde diário e o atendimento do Plano de Saúde da empresa – \nPASA. Os empregados devem fazer  um  monitoramento  diário  de  seus  sintomas por meio do \nChecklist  e  onde  a  legislação  permite,  o  questionário  diário  específico  para  cada  localidade \ndeverá ser preenchido por empregados e terceiros antes do seu turno de trabalho e durante os \ndias de folga. O preenchimento deverá ocorrer por indivíduos que estejam trabalhando nos sites \nou que tenham sido removidos dos sites por pertencerem ao grupo de risco aumentado para a \nforma grave da doença, e por indivíduos trabalhando remotamente. \n\nA  segunda  linha  de  defesa  é  o  distanciamento  físico,  aferição  da  temperatura  corporal  nas \nportarias e medidas de proteção e higiene em todas as unidades. Nessa linha, para ampliar a \nproteção da  saúde  e  segurança  dos trabalhadores que  precisam atuar  nas operações,  a Vale \nadotou padrões de segurança de nível mundial, seguindo as premissas da Organização Mundial \nda Saúde (OMS) , incluindo: \n\n  Adoção de regime de home-office para todos os empregados considerados nos grupos \n\nde risco e para os quais a função não requeira presença física; \n\n  Ajustes aos procedimentos das operações e do transporte de empregados, garantindo \n\no distanciamento social; \n\n  Acesso às operações somente por equipes essenciais; \n  Suspensão de todas as obras de construções não essenciais; \n  Aferição de temperatura corporal nas entradas de sites operacionais; \n\nPage 1 of 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fImplementação do checklist diário e monitoramento contínuo de potenciais sintomas; \n\n \n  Comunicação interna extensa sobre prevenção de contágio e canais de assistência \n\nmédica 24 horas por dia e 7 dias por semana; \n\n  Distribuição de máscaras para os empregados, terceiros e para os membros da \n\ncomunidade onde está presente. \n\nA Vale tambem decidiu por testar todos seus empregados como a terceira linha de defesa no \ncombate à pandemia, criando mais uma barreira com o objetivo de aumentar a segurança das \noperações e ganhar agilidade na gestão dos ciclos de quarentena. A testagem em massa dos \nempregados  para  identificar  e  monitorar  o  quadro  dos  empregados  e,  com  isso,  melhorar  o \ngerenciamento de quarentena possibilitou proteger ainda mais os trabalhadores das operações.  \n\nPolíticas de Distanciamento Físico para Pandemia COVID-19 \nAlém  da  limpeza  e  desinfecção  dos  ambientes  internos  diariamente,  do  uso  adequado  de \nmáscara cobrindo a boca e o nariz e da higienização das mãos com água e sabão ou álcool em \ngel 70%, durante as ondas de pico de uma pandemia, é importante minimizar o contato próximo \nentre as pessoas. A Vale incentiva cada unidade a avaliar o risco para seus empregados e a ser \nproativa  para  implementar  qualquer  medida  de  distanciamento  físico  considerada  uma \nestratégia de mitigação relevante. \n\nExemplos  de  medidas  de  distanciamento  físico  adotadas  pelas  unidades \nincluem  o \nestabelecimento de locais de trabalho flexíveis e horários de trabalho flexíveis (por exemplo, \nturnos alternados), para aumentar a distância física entre empregados e entre empregados e \noutros; redução do uso de transporte público não essencial, alternância nos horário de trabalho \n(parte do pessoal no trabalho e parte no escritório em casa) ou trabalhar na capacidade de home \noffice; remoção de 50% dos assentos das salas de reunião e conferência; aumento do uso de \nteleconferência,  videoconferência  ou  ferramentas  colaborativas  baseadas  na  Web  entre  os \nprincipais. \n\nAção Humanitária \nDesde o início da pandemia, a Vale esteve à disposição do governo federal, estados e municípios \na  fim  de  colaborar onde  necessário. Considerando a presença  histórica  na  China,  combinada \ncom a capacidade logística da empresa, foi possível realizar algumas ações importantes em 2020 \ne 2021, dentre as ações no Brasil destaca-se: \n\n  Em 2020 - Importação e doação de 5 milhões de kits de testes rápidos, quase 16 \n\nmilhões de EPIs para o Ministério da Saúde; \n\n  Em 2021 - Importação e doação para o SUS (Sistema Único de Saúde, responsável pela \n\ndistribuição pelos estados brasileiros) de 50 milhões de seringas para que não \nfaltassem insumos para a campanha de vacinação, além de 3,7 milhões de unidades de \nmedicamentos para intubação, em parceria com outras empresas. \n\nDesde o 2T20, a Vale doou mais de R$ 600 milhões para a luta contra a COVID-19 nas regiões \nonde atua. A empresa ajudou, por exemplo, na construção de hospitais de campanha, reforma \nde  unidades  de  saúde  e  compra  de  equipamentos  para  os  estados onde  opera.  Em  2021,  as \nações continuaram, destacando-se: \n\n- Doação de 400 mil EPIs para a proteção de profissionais na linha de frente da vacinação; \n\n- Apoio no valor de R$ 10 milhões ao Instituto Butantan para a conclusão das obras de ampliação \ndo Centro de Produção Multipropósito de Vacinas (CPMV), que terá capacidade de produção de \n\nPage 2 of 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\faté 100 milhões de doses por ano, prestar apoio aos municípios das regiões de atuação para o \nenfrentamento da pandemia e com abertura prevista até setembro 2021; \n\n- Doação para a Secretaria Especial de Saúde Indígena (“SESAI”), do Ministério da Saúde, de kits \npara serviço de tele saúde para equipar 100% dos polos de saúde indígena do Brasil; \n\n- Unindo esforços com várias organizações (CUFA, Ação da Cidadania, World Food Programme \n(WFP), Gerando Falcões e Frente Anti-racista), a Vale também contribui no combate à fome no \nBrasil  que  se  acentuou  durante  a  pandemia,  com  a  doação  de  um milhão  de  cestas  básicas, \natingindo 219 mil famílias, pelo período de seis meses. \n\nAções em Minas Gerais \nAo longo de 2020, a Vale reforçou seu compromisso de proteger empregados e prestadores de \nserviço, proporcionando um ambiente de trabalho seguro a todos, apoiando as comunidades \nonde está presente, fornecedores locais e equipando hospitais e profissionais de saúde. Com ao \nenvolvimento de todos, as operações da Vale permaneceram ativas, operando com segurança \npara contribuir com a economia mineira.  \n\n  + de 55 mil kits de testes (COVID-19) para os territórios onde está presente \n  + de 440 mil testes rápidos repassados à Secretaria de Estado de Saúde de MG  \n  + de 1 milhão de máscaras cirúrgicas  \n  42 mil máscaras N95  \n  Cerca de 166 mil aventais  \n  + de 5 milhões de luvas  \n  800 óculos de proteção \n\nEm parceria com a Prefeitura de Itabira e a Universidade Federal de Itajubá - Campus Itabira \n(UNIFEI),  em  2020  a  Vale  também  apoiou  um  estudo  epidemiológico  sobre  a  prevalência  da \ninfecção pelo novo Coronavírus e sua evolução na cidade, com a doação de 10 mil kits de testes \nrápidos e Equipamentos de Proteção Individual (EPI).  \n\nA  Vale  continua  apoiando  instituições  de  Minas  Gerais,  doando  kits  de  teste  rápido  e \nequipamentos para a utilização em hospitais nas comunidades onde atua. Algumas das últimas \nações de apoio prestadas em 2021 no Corredor Sudeste são destacadas abaixo. \n\nNo final de julho 2021, Itabira contou com reforço no enfrentamento da COVID-19 com uma \nunidade móvel de saúde instalada em uma carreta possibilitando o atendimento primário de \npacientes com suspeita da doença. A iniciativa realizada em conjunto com a Vale, Mercedes-\nBenz  do  Brasil,  Sociedade  Beneficente  Israelita  Brasileira  Albert  Einstein  e  Prefeitura  tem  o \nobjetivo de reforçar a rede de saúde do município no combate da pandemia. A unidade móvel \nde saúde terá capacidade para 30 atendimentos diários que serão direcionados pelas unidades \ndo Programa Saúde da Família (PSF) da Prefeitura. Toda assistência ao paciente como realização \nde tomografias computadorizadas, além de exames de gasometria arterial e testes rápidos de \nCOVID-19, serão feitas pela equipe médica do Einstein, que conta com 10 profissionais. \n\nAmpliação de leitos para tratamento a pacientes - \nEm março 2021, o Einstein foi contratado pela Vale para realizar consultoria técnica em gestão \nde saúde para Itabira por meio da Secretaria Municipal de Saúde. Na ocasião, a Vale apoiou a \nimplantação de 20 UTIS, no Hospital Nossa Senhora das Dores, direcionados ao tratamento de \n\nPage 3 of 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fpacientes com a COVID-19, com equipe especializada e doou 10 ventiladores pulmonares, além \nde cinco geradores de alto fluxo para suporte respiratório.  \nA Vale também apoiou toda adequação do hospital que for necessária para a criação dos novos \nleitos de UTI, doou para o Hospital Nossa Senhora das Dores mais de 1,6 milhão de EPIs e mais \nde 8 mil kits de testes rápidos. \n\nCessão de UTI´s Móveis -  \nOs  hospitais  de  Barão  de  Cocais  e  Mariana  receberam  o  reforço  de  UTI´s  móveis  para \natendimento  24  horas  aos  pacientes  com  a  COVID-19.  As  UTI´s  contam  com  equipe  de \nprofissionais  que  inclui  um  médico,  um  enfermeiro,  um  socorrista  e  um  motorista,  além  de \nequipamentos e materiais de suporte necessários para o transporte de pacientes. \n\nDoação de cilindros de oxigênio - \nEm Itabira, Barão de Cocais, Mariana e Santa Bárbara, os hospitais receberam em abril 2021 a \ndoação de cilindros de oxigênio de 10m³. \n\nDoação de EPIs e testes rápidos -  \nO hospital de Santa Bárbara recebeu a doação de 148 unidades de luvas cirúrgicas, 267 máscaras \nmodelo  PFF2  sem  válvula, 1.584  máscaras  cirúrgicas,  560  aventais  hospitalares  e  100  kits  de \ntestes  rápidos.  Os  materiais  serão  usados  pelos  profissionais  de  saúde  no  atendimento  aos \npacientes com a COVID-19. \n\nDoação de testes rápidos -  \nPara Catas Altas foram destinados 5 mil testes rápidos de COVID-19, que estão sendo utilizados \nnas ações de combate à disseminação da doença na cidade. \n\nao \n\nMaiores  informações  sobre  as  ações  da  Vale  em  Minas  Gerais  e  em  outras  localidades, \nVALE: \nrelacionadas \nwww.vale.com/coronavirus \nem \nhttp://www.vale.com/brasil/PT/aboutvale/news/Documents/Balanco_valemais_final_MG_1s2\n0.pdf para maiores detalhes sobre as ações de 2020 no Estado de Minas Gerais. \n\nencontram-se \ne \n\nCOVID-19 \n\ncombate \n\nsite \n\nno \n\nao \n\nda \n\nA  Vale  tem  consciência  de  sua  responsabilidade  com  a  sociedade  e  do  papel  essencial  da \natividade que exerce para a economia do Brasil. Desde o início da pandemia, a Vale tem buscado \nmeios  para  contribuir  na  luta  contra  o  vírus,  protegendo  empregados  e  comunidades  e \npermanece com essa meta. \n\nPage 4 of 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fConcerning the Mining and  Human Rights' Report: Testimony of Unsustainability with \ninformation regarding COVID-19 in mined regions in the Rio Doce basin, Minas Gerais \n(MG) \n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, Vale has been carrying out a series of actions to prevent \nand  mitigate  as  much  as  possible  the  effects  caused  by  the  new  Coronavirus  (COVID-19). To \nensure operational continuity, with mining being considered an essential activity, the company \nfollows  the  recommendations  of  health  authorities,  such  as  the  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO),  with  absolute  rigor.  Some  of  the  main  measures  that  Vale  has  adopted  are  social \ndistancing,  immediate  medical  attention,  and  massive  testing,  which  allows  for  the  rapid \nidentification of people who have had contact with the virus and are asymptomatic. By following \nthe  WHO  protocol  and  taking  the  correct  measures,  Vale  makes  a  relevant  contribution  to \nfighting COVID-19, including in the cities where it is present, which has become a priority due to \ntwo pillars in our strategy: Safety and Operational Excellence and a New Pact with Society. \n\nTo face the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, with responsibility, discipline, and a \nsense  of  urgency,  a  crisis  response  plan  was  established,  with  processes  and  actions  that \nprioritize  the  health  and  safety  of  employees  and  communities  in  the  territories  where  the \ncompany operates. The  internal  procedure  determines  how  the  company's efforts should  be \nbased on mitigating the transmission of COVID-19 in its operations and, by extension, in the local \ncommunities of its operations, and its key objectives are: to protect the health of employees – \nown and third parties and communities; prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection at Vale's units worldwide; \nand  guaranteeing  safe  operational  continuity:  providing  the  necessary  conditions  so  that  a \nminimum workforce can ensure safe production. \n\nIn  this  sense,  Vale  has  adopted  three  levels  of  defense  against  the  COVID-19  virus  in  its \noperations.  \n\nThe first level is the daily Health Checklist and the service provided by the company's Health Plan \n– PASA. Employees must monitor their symptoms daily through the Checklist, and where the \nlegislation  allows,  the  daily  questionnaire  specific  to  each  location  must  be  completed  by \nemployees and third parties before their work shift and during days off. Completion must occur \nby  individuals  working  on  the  sites  or  who  have  been  removed  from  the  sites  because  they \nbelong  to  the  group  at  increased  risk  for  the  severe  form  of  the  disease  and  by  individuals \nworking remotely. \n\nThe second line of defense is the physical distance, measurement of body temperature at the \nentrances,  and  protection  and  hygiene  measures  at  all  units.  In  this  line,  to  expand  the \nprotection of the health and safety of workers who need to work in operations, Vale has adopted \nstandards of world-class safety, following the premises of the World Health Organization (WHO), \nincluding: \n\n  Adoption of a home-office regime for all employees considered in the risk groups and \n\nfor whom the function does not require physical presence; \n\n  Adjustments to the procedures of operations and transport of employees, ensuring \n\nsocial distance; \n\n  Access to operations only by critical teams; \n  Suspension of all non-essential construction works; \n  Body temperature scan at operational site entrances; \n \n\nImplementation of daily checklist and continuous monitoring of potential symptoms; \n\nPage   1 of 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  Extensive internal communication on contagion prevention and 24/7 healthcare \n\nchannels; \n\n  Distribution of masks for employees, contractors, and members of the community \n\nwhere it is present. \n\nVale also decided to test all its employees as the third line of defense in the fight against the \npandemic, creating yet another barrier to increase the security of operations and gain agility in \nthe management of quarantine cycles. In addition, massive testing of employees to identify and \nmonitor  staffing  and  thereby  improve  quarantine  management  made  it  possible  to  protect \noperations workers further.  \n\nPhysical Distancing Policies for the COVID-19 Pandemic \nIn  addition  to  daily  cleaning  and  disinfection  of  indoor  environments,  proper  use  of  a  mask \ncovering the mouth and nose, and hand hygiene with soap and water or 70% alcohol gel during \nthe  pandemic’s  peak  waves,  it  is  critical  to  minimize  the  close  contact  between  people. \nTherefore,  Vale  encourages  each  unit  to  assess  its  employees'  risk  and  be  proactive  in \nimplementing any measure of physical distancing considered a relevant mitigation strategy. \n\nExamples  of  physical  distancing  measures  adopted  by  units  include  establishing  flexible \nworkplaces and flexible working hours (e.g., alternating shifts) to increase the physical distance \nbetween  employees  and  between  employees  and  others;  reducing  the  use  of  non-essential \npublic transportation, alternating working hours (part of the staff at work and part in the home \noffice)  or  working  in  home  office  capacity;  removal  of  50%  of  seating  from  meeting  and \nconference  rooms;  increased  use  of  teleconferencing,  video  conferencing  or  web-based \ncollaborative tools among the majors. \n\nHumanitarian Action \nSince the pandemic's beginning, Vale has made itself available to the federal government, states, \nand municipalities to collaborate where necessary. Considering its historical presence in China, \ncombined with the company's logistical capacity, it was possible to carry out some important \nactions in 2020 and 2021. Among the actions in Brazil, the following can be highlighted: \n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2020 - Import and donation of 5 million rapid test kits, almost 16 million PPEs to the \nMinistry of Health; \nIn 2021 - Import and donation to the SUS (Unified Health System, responsible for \ndistributing to the Brazilian states) of 50 million syringes so that there was no shortage \nof supplies for the vaccination campaign, in addition to 3.7 million units of medication \nfor intubation, in partnership with other companies. \n\nSince  2Q20,  Vale  has  donated  more  than  R$600  million  to  the  fight  against  COVID-19  in  the \nregions  where  it  operates.  The  company  helped,  for  example,  in  the  construction  of  field \nhospitals,  renovation  of  health  units,  and  purchase  of  equipment  for  the  states  where  it \noperates. In 2021, the actions continued, highlighting: \n\n- Donation of 400,000 PPEs for the protection of professionals in the front line of vaccination; \n\n- Support in the amount of R$ 10 million to the Butantan Institute for the completion of the \nexpansion  works  of  the  Multipurpose  Vaccine  Production  Center  (CPMV),  which  will  have  a \nproduction capacity of up to 100 million doses per year, providing support to municipalities in \nthe regions of action to fight the pandemic and scheduled to open by September 2021; \n\nPage   2 of 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f- Donation to the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (“SESAI”), of the Ministry of Health, \nof kits for the telehealth service to equip 100% of the indigenous health centers in Brazil; \n\n-  Joining  efforts  with  various  organizations  (CUFA,  Citizenship  Action,  World  Food  Program \n(WFP),  Gerando  Falcões  and  the  Anti-racist  Front),  Vale  also  contributes  to  the  fight  against \nhunger in Brazil, which increased during the pandemic, with the donation of one million basic \nfood baskets, reaching 219 thousand families, for a period of six months. \n\nActions in Minas Gerais \nThroughout  2020,  Vale  reinforced  its  commitment  to  protecting  employees  and  service \nproviders, providing a safe working environment for all, supporting the communities where it \noperates,  local  suppliers,  and  equipping  hospitals  and  healthcare  professionals.

The  mobile  health  unit  will  have  a  capacity  for  30  daily \nappointments that will be directed by the branches of the Family Health Program (PSF) of the \nCity Hall. All assistance to the patient, such as CT scans, in addition to arterial blood gases and \nCOVID-19  rapid  tests,  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Einstein  medical  team,  which  has  10 \nprofessionals. \n\nExpansion of beds for patient treatment - \nIn March 2021, Vale hired Einstein to carry out technical consultancy in health management for \nItabira  through  the  Municipal  Health  Department.  At  the  time,  Vale  supported  the \nimplementation of 20 ICUs at Hospital Nossa Senhora das Dores, aimed at treating patients with \nCOVID-19, with a  specialized  team  and  donated 10 pulmonary ventilators, in addition to  five \nhigh-flow generators for respiratory support.  \n\nPage   3 of 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fVale also supported any hospital adaptation that is necessary for the creation of new ICU beds, \ndonated more than 1.6 million PPE and more than 8,000 rapid test kits to Hospital Nossa Senhora \ndas Dores. \n\nAssignment of Mobile ICU's -  \nThe hospitals of Barão de Cocais and Mariana received the reinforcement of mobile ICUs for 24-\nhour  care  for  patients with  COVID-19. The  ICUs have  a  team of  professionals that includes  a \ndoctor, a nurse, a rescuer, and a driver and the equipment and support materials needed to \ntransport patients. \n\nDonation of oxygen cylinders - \nIn  Itabira,  Barão  de  Cocais,  Mariana,  and  Santa  Bárbara,  hospitals  received  in April  2021  the \ndonation of oxygen cylinders of 10m³. \n\nDonation of PPE and quick tests -  \nThe  Santa  Barbara  hospital  received  the  donation  of  148  surgical  gloves,  267  valveless  PFF2 \nmodel  masks,  1,584  surgical  masks,  560  hospital  gowns,  and  100  rapid  test  kits.  Health \nprofessionals in patient care will use the materials with COVID-19. \n\nQuick Test Donation -  \nFive thousand rapid tests of COVID-19 were destined for Catas Altas, which are being used in \nactions to combat the spread of the disease in the city. \n\nMore information about Vale's actions in Minas Gerais and other locations related to the fight \nagainst  COVID-19  can  be  found  at  VALE's  website:  www.vale.com/coronavirus  and  at \nhttp://www.vale.com/brasil/PT/aboutvale/news/Documents/Balanco_valemais_final_MG_1s2\n0.pdf for more details on the actions in 2020 in the State of Minas Gerais. \n\nVale is aware of its responsibility to society and the essential role of its activity for the Brazilian \neconomy.

L’ambition  climat  de  TotalEnergies  se  base  en  priorité  sur  la \nréduction de ses émissions de GES et pour cela l’entreprise s’est fixée des objectifs en valeurs absolues, \nrappelés récemment lors de la présentation du Strategy and Outlook de septembre 2021.  \n\nLes projets visant à capter et à séquestrer du carbone ont pour objectif de neutraliser les émissions \nrésiduelles. Ces solutions sont essentielles pour parvenir à la neutralité carbone car elles viennent créer des \npuits additionnels au sein du cycle du carbone. Le CCS fait partie des piliers clé pour la décarbonation de \nnos activités selon le World Energy Outlook de l’AIE (chap. 2.5).  \nEn effet, parvenir à la neutralité carbone en 2050 nécessitera des baisses importantes d’émissions qui sont \nactuellement pour TotalEnergies de l’ordre de 41 MtCO2e par an (scopes 1 et 2 des installations oil and \ngas opérées en 2019). Les objectifs fixés par TotalEnergies pour ses projets de stockage et de séquestration \ndu carbone sont de 5 MtCO2/an de capacité de stockage pour les projets CCS et de minimum 5MtCO2e/an \nde capacité de séquestration pour les projets de Nature-based Solutions (NBS) d’ici 2030 (voir ‘Climate \nroadmap in action’) ; volumes largement inférieurs aux émissions devant être réduites. \nSeules,  ces  solutions  de  compensation  carbone  seraient  donc  insuffisantes,  mais  en  complément  d’une \nbaisse des émissions, elles sont de réels atouts pour limiter la hausse des températures. \n\nTotalEnergies  développe  ses  projets  de  captage/stockage  et  de  séquestration  du  CO2  de  manière \nresponsable et transparente.  \nPour  les  raisons  mentionnées  précédemment,  TotalEnergies  fait  le  choix  de  développer  des  projets \npermettant de séquestrer le CO2 atmosphérique, soit dans le sous-sol via le CCS, soit via des projets basés \nsur la nature (NBS). Le projet NBS en République du Congo, porté par TotalEnergies et l’entreprise Forêt \nRessources  Management,  fait  l’objet  d’études  d’impact  environnemental  et  sociétal,  y  compris  des \nconsultations avec les représentants des peuples autochtones. Sur l’aspect environnemental, les acacias ont \nété choisis pour leur capacité de régénération des sols qui leur permettra d’enrichir en matière organique et \nen  azote  les  sols  sableux  des  plateaux  Batéké  et  de  créer  une  végétation  de  sous-bois,  beaucoup  plus \ndiversifiée. Les forêts naturelles présentes sur le projet, actuellement sous forte pression de déforestation, \nseront  intégralement  protégées.  Enfin,  l’ensemble  des  projets  NBS  de  TotalEnergies  suivent  des  cycles \nlongs  et  seront  suivis  dans  le  temps :  l’entreprise  entend  signer  des  contrats  de  longue  durée  avec  ses \npartenaires afin d’assurer le suivi et la pérennité des activités. \nToujours  suivant  ce  même  principe  de  transparence,  le  projet  de  CCS  Northern  Lights  en  Norvège \nmentionné dans le rapport a fait l’objet d’une étude d’impact complète, publiée sur le site du gouvernement \nnorvégien. Le bilan carbone global de la chaîne de valeur du projet a également été évalué (étude ‘Full \nchain CO2 footprint’) et montre que les volumes de CO2 capturés par le projet seront largement supérieurs \naux émissions induites.  \n\nLa compensation carbone fait donc partie de la stratégie climat de TotalEnergies en tant que levier \npour neutraliser les émissions résiduelles, et non pour remplacer les efforts de réduction des émissions \nde GES qui restent l’axe central de la stratégie. Les projets qui porteront cette compensation sont déjà, \net seront,  encadrés  par  des  standards  environnementaux  et  sociétaux élevés  et TotalEnergies continuera \nd’agir en transparence au cours des différentes étapes des projets."}

When the Karnataka Government’s postponement of the Dearness Allowance (DA) \nended in April  2021, we issued a memo  to  our  suppliers requiring them  to  immediately pay the  arrears \nowed to the workers and thereafter to make the correct payment of minimum wages, including the adjusted \nDA.  The  suppliers  responded  by  disputing  the  legal  basis  for  that  request,  citing  the  ongoing  court \nproceedings. Given our very small sourcing footprint in Karnataka (< 5% of the volume, in two factories) we \nreached out to and engaged with our suppliers’ main buyers, to address the suppliers’ failure to act. \n\nWe have continued that engagement and together with other major brands we have met with the \nKarnataka State Labor Commissioner to raise our concerns over the lack of clarity and direction given to \nthe suppliers concerning payment of the revised DA and application of the High Court’s preliminary \nruling.  \n\nIn parallel with these engagements, we have also initiated enforcement action against our suppliers for \nfailure to meet our Standards over the payment of the minimum wage. \n\nWith all the hardship and disruption caused by Covid-19 in recent years, securing a proper and timely \npayment of a worker’s basic wages is an imperative and we continue to press the State authorities and \nour suppliers for the earliest possible resolution of this case.  \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President, Global  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \n\nPage 1 of 1"}

What  minimum  threshold  of  compliance  with  Company  Expectations  should  be \nrequired for a company to be listed with the distinction of being an EITI Supporting \nCompany?  \n\nThe  recent  assessment  conducted  by  EITI  about  the  Expectations  for  EITI  supporting \ncompanies  sought  to  identify  good  practice  as  well  as  gaps  in  disclosures.  It  also \nhighlighted opportunities for clarifying the expectations and improving communication \naround good practices. Vale supports the discussions related to companies’ compliance, \nand  the  EITI  already-planned  next  steps,  according  to  EITI  governance  practices,  of \nconsidering how to address areas for improvement in performance on the Expectations \nfor  EITI  supporting  companies,  with  the  objective  of  a  more  transparent  and \naccountable extractive sector. \n\n2.  Does your company agree that Expectation 1 should mandate meaningful support, like \nrequiring  that  EITI  Supporting  Companies  will  voice  their  support  for  –  and  not \nundermine  by  lobbying  against  –  laws,  regulations,  and  policies  that  promote \ntransparency efforts aligned with the EITI Standard in the jurisdictions they operate in \nand globally?   \n\nAs  mentioned  above,  we  support  that  EITI  addresses,  according  to  EITI  governance \npractices,  areas  for  improvement  in  performance  on  the  Expectations  for  EITI \nSupporting  Companies,  including  Expectation  1,  with  the  aim  to  promote  greater \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  the  extractives  sector,  and  overall  contribute  to \nsustainable development.  \n\n3.  Does your company agree that EITI Supporting Companies should make project-level \npayments-to-government disclosures, in line with the EITI Standard, in all jurisdictions \nwhere they operate, as outlined in Company Expectations 2 and 3?  \n\nVale  understands  the  value  of  transparency  in  disclosing  taxes  and  payments  to \ngovernments and that project-level disclosure is an information that can be of relevant \ninterest and that, as such, it be part of EITI standards. \n\nPage  1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4.  Does your company believe that companies should be excused for not complying with \nExpectation  2  if  they  provide  an  explanation  for  their  non-compliance?  Has  your \ncompany  ever  encountered  a  law  that  prevented  you  from  complying  with \nExpectation 2?  \n\nOur  company  has  not  so  far  encountered  legislations  preventing  from  releasing \ninformation  complying  with  Expectation  2.  We  reinforce  that  Vale  supports  the \ndiscussions related to companies’ compliance, and the EITI already-planned next steps, \naccording  to  EITI  governance  practices,  of  considering  how  to  address  areas  for \nimprovement in performance on the Expectations for EITI supporting companies, with \nthe objective of a more transparent and accountable extractive sector. \n\n5.  What consequences should exist for EITI Supporting Companies that do not comply \n\nwith the Company Expectations?  \n\nCompanies  should  be  constantly  assessed  by  EITI  based  on  public  information  and \nadhere  to  what  is  specifically  defined  by  EITI  after  implementation  around  potential \nchanges to EITI Supporting Companies Expectations, which proceeds according to EITI \ngovernance practices. Vale believes that a well-defined mechanism for consequences \nshould  exist  for  Supporting  Companies  that  are  not  meeting  and  not  showing \nimprovements  against  the  Expectations  for  EITI  supporting  companies,  for  example, \nregarding the possibility of nomination of representative to the EITI Board. \n\n6.  Are EITI Board Members that do not comply with the Company Expectations able to \nadequately  represent  the  interests  of  your  company,  the  Supporting  Company \nconstituency, and the Initiative as a whole? \n\nConsidering that EITI Board is the EITI's main governing body which decides on priorities \nfor  the  organization,  and  that  its  main  responsibilities  include  ensuring  that  EITI \noperates  transparently,  Vale  encourages  EITI  to  address  and  implement  a  specific \nprocess related to the possibility of a supporting company eligibility for nomination or \nre-nomination to EITI Board linked to the company adherence to the EITI Supporting \nCompanies Expectations. \n\nRestricted Information \n\nPage  2 of 2"}

Below you will find a brief \ndescription of our general approach to fair wages - which is the central issue in the CCC study – \nand an explanation of the wage-setting processes we have pursued in the Ukraine.  \n\nGeneral Approach  \n\nAt adidas we are committed to ensuring fair labour practices, fair wages and safe and \nenvironmental-friendly working conditions throughout our global supply chain. With respect to \nour suppliers, we follow a well-developed and progressive Fair Compensation Strategy, which we \nhave developed in partnership with the Fair Labor Association, a multi-stakeholder US labour \nrights advocacy group.  \n\nOur Fair Compensation Strategy requires that:  \n\n1.  We do not infringe on the rights of workers, their employers and governments to set fair \n\nwages as a minimum;  \n\n2.  We conduct due diligence and act when business partners are not compliant with the \n\nlaw or our Workplace Standards; and,  \n\n3.  We facilitate positive wage progression and fair wages in our supply chain.  \n\nThe idea of a living wage is that workers and their families are able to afford a basic, but decent, \nstandard of living that is considered acceptable by society at its current level of economic \ndevelopment. Fair compensation goes deeper. It considers the fairness of the wage that a \nworker is paid by benchmarking whether wages: are paid regularly and on time, include the \nlegal minimum, allow decent living standards, reflect a worker’s performance and skills, \nreward overtime, follow price increases paid for the products they are making, are linked to \ntheir employer’s profits and sales, reflect changes in work technology, are negotiated \nindividually or collectively with workers, are clearly and formally communicated to workers.  \n\nAs a responsible business, we do not want the workers employed in our supply chain to face \nhardship in their daily lives. Our aspiration, as set out in the core principles of our Workplace \nStandards, is that workers earn enough for their basic needs and also have income remaining to \ncover their discretionary spending as well as savings. We seek business partners who \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fprogressively raise employee living standards through improved wage systems, benefits, \nwelfare programmes and other services which enhance quality of life.  \n\nWages in Eastern Europe  \n\nWe have sought to address and improve supplier wages in Eastern Europe through wage \nassessments and in-country collaborations.  \n\nThe CCC report states, incorrectly, that adidas is producing goods in Bulgaria. We are not. \nHowever, we do have production in Ukraine and have benchmarked wages for that country.  \n\nTo complete the benchmark, we reached out to the Ukrainian statistics office to obtain \nnationwide wage data and, in parallel, conducted wage surveys in each of our partner’ factories. \nFrom the combined data, we created a wage map. The mapping showed that our manufacturing \npartners were already paying a prevailing industry wage, one that was significantly higher than \nthe legal minimum wage.  \n\nSince our initial benchmarking study, we have continued to track the wage payments for \nworkers employed by these suppliers.  \n\nWe remain committed to delivering fair wages across our supply chain, including in production \nfacilities in Eastern Europe.  \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President, Global \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

We put this \nprogram in place early in the pandemic, to safeguard the health and safety of workers in our supply \nchain.  Like  all  other  adidas  suppliers,  Tsang  Yih  Co.  Ltd  (reported  as  Chang  Yi  Footwear  in  your \ncorrespondence) was required to develop, and strictly implement, a comprehensive set of Covid-19 \nsafety measures, which includes screening, enforcing social distancing, strict hygiene standards and \nproper case handling for any workers who reported in sick or tested positive for Covid-19. We continue \nto monitor the implementation of the Covid-19 safety measures at Tsang Yih, including through on-\nthe-ground inspections, and we have required the factory to promptly close any gaps or deficiencies \nthat have been found. At present, Tsang Yih has very high vaccination rate among its workforce (93% \nof employees) and very few positive cases of Covid-19. \n\nWe have followed closely the reported arrest of a former employee of Pou Chen Myanmar (‘PMA’), \nwho was held in detention, but then subsequently released. The individual concerned was linked to a \nreported  case  of  theft,  that  was  resolved  through  an  Arbitration  Council  ruling  in  June  2020.  It \ntherefore  came  as  a  surprise  to  PMA  that  15  months  later  the  police  proceeded  to  bring  criminal \ncharges against the ex-employee. On learning of the arrest, PMA immediately appealed to the police \nto drop the charges. However, this was unsuccessful, and the case went to Court. In the end PMA twice \npetitioned  the  Court  to  dismiss  the  case  and  in  early  May  2022  the  former  employee  was  finally \nreleased from prison. \n\nadidas continues to monitor closely the situation in Myanmar and is fully engaged with our suppliers, \nto ensure that the rights of workers in our supply chain are upheld. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President, Global \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \n\nPage 1 of 1"}

In this sense, we were \ninformed  that  dismissal  factory  process  was  followed  in  line  with  the  Law  of  the  Land  and \ncommunicated in the Worker Coordination Committee (WCC). This process included the sending \nof 4 warning letters to the worker since September 2020.  \n\nIn a different period of time, in this case, in June 2021, the factory informed us that an explosion \nhappened at the factory and the pertinent investigation was taken by police with interviews to \ndifferent type of workers (members and not members or the Union).

These span the peak of the Covid period. In the link you will find a summary of specific \nallegations raised by local and global unions on FOA and other related topics, and details of the \ninvestigations and remedial actions taken by adidas to resolve such cases. This includes a good \nnumber of supplier cases in Southeast Asia. \n\nWith respect to the extract you have shared, the union official is referring to a worker furlough that \ntook place at a footwear supplier in Indonesia in 2020. In brief, the factory concerned has multiple \ntrade unions and prior to applying for a temporary furlough for workers, it negotiated and reached \nagreement with its 3 existing unions that held representational rights under its CBA, i.e., those trade \nunions that held membership levels greater than 10% of the workforce. Shortly after that agreement \nwas reached, a fourth union was formed, which complained that it had not been consulted on the \nworker furlough program. The newly formed union membership represented less than 1% of the \nworkforce and, by law, it did not qualify as a consultee. This was confirmed by the local labor \nauthority. Nevertheless, to resolve the complaint the supplier conducted a retrospective meeting in \nearly 2021 to share the details of the agreement reached with the other representative unions. The \nsupplier provided the fourth union with the context and particulars related to the decision to pursue \na temporary furlough, including the ongoing Covid restrictions, data on worker leave entitlements, \nplanned order volumes, the non-financial support being offered to workers, as well as the cash-\nassistance program that was provided by BPJS, the government’s social insurance provider.  \n\nWe shared the results of our investigation into the above case with the Asia Floor Wage, who had \nacted as an intermediary for the fourth union.  \n\nWe understood that the union was satisfied with the disclosure and the reasons given for the worker \nfurlough. \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReference is also made in your report to Covid-19 deaths.  \n\nFrom the very outset of the pandemic adidas provided our business partners with comprehensive \nguidelines on worker hygiene and infectious disease control, aligned with WHO standards, and these \nwere strictly followed by the suppliers’ factory, as was the testing and vaccine requirements \nsubsequently rolled-out by the local health authorities in each country.  \n\nWe trust the above answers your question, and we look forward to receiving and reviewing your full \nreport, once this is published. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President, Global  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

Kingfisher project is operated by the \nChinese company CNOOC.  These two projects have a common ownership, in the form of contractual \nJoint  Ventures  between  UNOC  (the  Uganda  National  Oil  Company),  TotalEnergies  EP  Uganda  and \nCNOOC.  \nEACOP (East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline) project’s purpose is to transport  petroleum (crude oil) from \nKabaale, in Uganda, Hoima district, to the port of Tanga on the Indian Ocean coast in Tanzania.  More \ndetails are available at https://eacop.com/overview/ . It is operated by EACOP Ltd, a company whose \nshareholders are TotalEnergies  Holdings  EACOP, UNOC, TPDC (Tanzania Petroleum Development \nCompany) and CNOOC.  \n\n- \n\nTilenga and EACOP projects follow both the Laws and Regulations of Uganda, and Tanzania (for EACOP \nproject), as well as abiding by international best practice including the International Finance Corporation \n(IFC) Performance Standards, the Equator Principles IV, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human \nRights (UNGP) and the UN Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR).  \n\nPreliminary general observations:  \n\nIt  is  to  be  noted  that  many  of  the  allegations  mentioned  in  the  article  published  by  Just  Finance \nInternational do not reflect the reality. The EACOP team knows and is already in touch with the individuals \nmentioned in the article and what is described in Just Finance International article is not accurate.  We \nare ready and happy to discuss this in more detail with Just Finance International.  \n\nWe regret that the article mentions that Just  Finance  International  has  “on  a  number  of  occasions, \ncontacted the EACOP consortium for comment, but to date, it has yet to provide a response”. This is not \ncorrect since the EACOP team is not aware of any such contact. TotalEnergies and EACOP remain open \nand would be pleased to discuss any aspect of the project.  \n\nFollowing the allegations formulated in the article, it should be made clear that Uganda has made a choice \nto exploit its natural resources and that Uganda and Tanzania chose TotalEnergies in light of its operational \nexpertise  but also and importantly to ensure that  international best practice on social and environmental \nmatters are implemented.  \n\nThe  Tilenga  and  EACOP  projects  require  a  land  acquisition  program  for  approximately  6,400  hectares \ninvolving approximately 18,700 Project Affected Persons (PAP - households or landowners / land tenants). \n\n \n \n \n\fThe land acquisition process is carried out on behalf of the Ugandan and Tanzanian governments in close \ncollaboration with specialized partners and local stakeholders and done in accordance with national laws, \nthe  UN  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  and  IFC  Performance  Standards  5  and  8. \nIndependent  experts  have  also  assisted  in  implementing  and monitoring  such acquisition  processes  in \nboth countries.  \n\nIn accordance with Ugandan law, the compensation rates applied are approved by the Chief Government \nValuer  (CGV)  and  District  Land  Boards  (DLBs).  Rates  for  land  properties  and  permanent  buildings  are \ndetermined based on market analysis conducted by an accredited appraiser and verified and approved by \nthe CGV. Rates for crops and temporary structures are set by the DLBs. The process is broadly similar in \nTanzania. \n\nRegarding the most vulnerable households, additional socio-economic studies were also carried out to \nidentify them and related action plans were designed and are implemented to  provide an appropriate \nresponse to their situation with the aim of maintaining and even improving their standards of livelihood. \n\n1-  Human rights commitments and policy: \n\nBoth  Tilenga  and  EACOP  have  published  their  respective  Human  Rights  policies  which  set  out  their \ncommitment to respect Human Rights and applicable laws in all activities and to implement the United \nNations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact \nPrinciples,  the  OECD  Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises,  the  fundamental  conventions  of  the \nInternational Labour Organization and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. They can \nbe found here: https://corporate.totalenergies.ug/system/files/atoms/files/human_rights_policy.pdf;  \n\nCross-functional Human Rights Committees have been set up at Senior Management level to support \nthe implementation of the projects Human Rights Action Plan.  \n\n2-  Human Rights due diligence:  \n\nBoth  Tilenga  and  EACOP  have  commissioned  their  respective  stand-alone  Human  Rights  Impact \nAssessments (HRIA) to understand the risks and impacts of the Projects on human rights and to develop \nrelated  proactive  and  comprehensive  Human  Rights  Action  Plans  to  respond  to  and  manage  the \nProject’s  salient  human  rights  issues  as  it  moves  through  the  construction  and  operational  phases. \nActions taken in accordance with the Human Rights Action Plans are closely monitored.  \n\nThe Tilenga Assessment builds upon prior studies that the Project has undertaken, notably through the \nEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and other related studies.   \n\nESIA and prior human \nrights reports about the \nTilenga Project\n\n(2015 to 2020)\n\nHRIA process and \nstakeholder \nengagement \n\n(2020 - 2021)\n\nDisclosure of HRIA and \nimplemenation of \nHuman Rights Action \nPlan framework\n\n(2022 onwards)\n\n \n \n \n\fThe Tilenga HRIA was carried out in a collaborative and participatory manner by Eco & Partners Consult \n(Uganda) and LKL International Consulting Inc. between December 2020 and January  2022.  Extensive \nfieldwork with stakeholders was carried out. It can be found here: \n\nhttps://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/documents/2022-07/HRIA_Summary_Report.pdf \n\nhttps://corporate.totalenergies.ug/system/files/atoms/files/tilenga_hria_-_full_report_0.pdf \n\nThe EACOP HRIA was carried out in September 2018 by LKL International Consulting Inc (Canada), it can \nbe found here : \n\nEACOP - Provisional HRIA - Final Report \n\nThe following table presents the salient human rights issues that have been identified for the Tilenga \nproject. The EACOP HRIA also largely mirrors these salient issues: \n\nWorkers’ Rights \n\nCommunities’ Human Rights \n\nSecurity and Human Rights \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\nInteractions \nGovernment \nForces \n\nwith \nSecurity \n\nInteractions  with  Private \nSecurity Providers \n\n▪  Contractor \nsuppliers’ \nrights \n\nand \nworkers’ \n\n▪  Right  to  information  and \nconsultation  on  access  to \nland and resettlement \n\n▪  Project-induced in-\n\nmigration \n\n▪  Road safety \n\n▪  Cultural rights  \n\nCross-cutting Human Rights \n\n▪  Women’s rights, gender equality and vulnerable groups \n\n▪  Grievance mechanisms and access to remedy \n\n▪  Human Rights Defenders \n\nNote that an update of the EACOP HRIA is currently in progress.  \n\n3-  Access to remedy: \n\nGrievance mechanisms respecting the UNGPs criteria of efficiency have been in place since the beginning \nof the projects. Dedicated teams daily provide remedy to the grievances that are received and make sure \nthey are solved in a satisfactory manner for the impacted persons. \n\nThere are several ways to file a complaint : either with the EACOP or TotalEnergies EP Uganda teams in \nthe  field,  or  with  local  communities’  leaders,  or  via  a  dedicated  toll-free  phone  number.  Community \nLiaison Officers (CLOs) are available to register all project-related grievances including those related to \ncompensation, and to help to resolve them. \n\n \n \n\fThere is a four-step procedure in place to handle complaints: registering the complaint, dialogue once the \ninvestigation is completed to discuss the proposed solution, the resolution phase if the proposed solution \nis accepted, and a continued dialogue phase if the proposed solution is not accepted.  \n\nAll  complaints  are  investigated  and  dealt  with  regardless  of  the  route  used  to  file  the  complaint  and \nregardless of who was initially called upon to register the complaint.  \n\n4-  Land acquisition process and compensation rates for land : \n\nThe  implementation  of  the  Tilenga  and  EACOP  projects  requires  the  implementation  of  a  land \nacquisition program involving 18,700 Project Affected Persons (PAPs). According to the terminology of \nthe International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank, a Project Affected Person \ncorresponds to a group of individuals forming a household or an entity (institution, company) with at \nleast one asset impacted by the implementation of a project. \n\nCompensation for those who have to be displaced was initially proposed in kind or in cash. A majority of \nimpacted people chose to be compensated in cash. The amounts for compensation rates were approved \nby government, starting in 2018, based on governmental official scale and on third party survey of the \nlocal land market.  In Uganda  the compensation  rates were approved by the Chief Government Valuer \nbased on Valuation reports which considered the different land tenure systems as enshrined in the 1995 \nConstitution and the 1998 Land Act.  \n\nThe basis of valuation of land is Market Value. This value was determined using the Sales Comparisons \nApproach where market evidence such as recent land sales agreements and land transfers were collected \nfrom  the  project  area.  In  addition,  interviews  with  local  government  representatives,  Area  Land \nCommittee members  and other local residents found to be knowledgeable  with the local land market \nwere conducted. This information was analysed to reach an appropriate rate per unit area to be used in \nthe valuation. The market research exercise targeted the different landowners within the specific village \nin the project area. \n\nLands  are  generally  heterogeneous  (i.e.,  have  different  characteristics).  Data  were  collected  through \ninterviews with the targeted respondents. Evidence and records of the transactions were requested for \nby the interviewer where applicable.  \n\nIn determining land values, the following types of information were used: \n\nLocation of the land \nLand tenure system  \n\n• \n• \n•  Other interests on land (e.g kibanja, lawful or bonafide occupants...) \n•  Size of the land \n• \nLand Uses \n•  Recent land transactions \n\nTotalEnergies and EACOP are aware of concerns voiced about the time lag  between EACOP land and \nasset surveys and payment of compensations. In addition to a 30% disturbance allowance, cognizant of \nthe exceptional delays which have occurred, the EACOP project has committed to apply an uplift on top \nof the compensation calculations. In Uganda this uplift is 15% after each complete year since the cutoff \n\n \n\fdate.  In Hoima, EACOP pipeline runs for 5.4 kilometres and affects only one village with a total number \nof 82 Project Affected Persons, with a total affected land area of 34.428 acres.  \n\nCompensation is paid to the PAPs  and Notice to Vacate is issued to the PAPs with a time allowed for the \nPAPs to salvage any items and to harvest their crops prior to any work and prior the project accesses to \nland.  EACOP team is already in touch with the persons mentioned in the Just Finance International article \nand their current situations are not at all what Just Finance International describes.  \n\nAs of end of November 2022, the numbers of PAPs impacted by the EACOP pipeline are as follows: \n\nUganda:  \n\n•  3648 in Uganda, of whom only a minority (203) are physically relocated in other areas \n•  179 PAPs chose to be relocated to a house. 148 houses are under construction;     \n•  2830 PAPs signed the compensation agreement (78%);  \n•  2358  (65%) received their compensation. The process is on-going (there being a 30- days period \n\nbetween signing and receiving compensation); \n\n  Tanzania :  \n\n•  9510 PAPs,  of whom 331 are physically relocated to other areas ;  \n•  309 PAPs chose to be relocated to a house. 69 houses are under construction and 37 houses have \n\nbeen completed.   \n\n•  7505 PAPs signed the compensation agreement (79%); \n•  6005  (63%)  received  their  compensation  (there  being  a  30-days  period  between  signing  and \n\nreceiving compensation);    \n\n•  1500 (20%) for which payment is pending   \n•  For 21 PAPs the choice has not yet been made  \n•  388  households  of  the  9510  affected  households  have  vacated  their  land  and  are  receiving \ntransitional food support and livelihood restoration programmes which may require a certain time \nspan to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration (e.g crops).  \n\n“Physically relocated” means that the PAPs prime dwelling is impacted by the pipeline route.  In such cases \nthe person is offered a replacement housing or a cash compensation.   \n\nAll the other “Project Affected Persons” are economically impacted, meaning that all (or in most cases a \nportion) of their land is required for the route although some do not live on this land or portion of land.   \n\nAll affected households have been encouraged to keep farming and taking care of their trees and crops \nand any other assets until they receive the official “Notice to Vacate”. This message is reinforced by village \nleadership and local government.   \n\nEACOP project : Following the Final Investment Decision for the EACOP project in February 2022, EACOP \nteam is now proceeding with the land acquisition and compensation process along the main Right of Way \nin both countries.   \n\nAlong the EACOP pipeline, many PAPs have already used their compensation to purchase land to replace \nthat affected by the Project. However, should a PAP not be satisfied with land and assets compensation \nrates, she or he is able to register a grievance through the Project grievance mechanism, which is in place \n\n\fand respects the efficiency criteria of the UNGPs; EACOP social performance teams are in charge of dealing \nwith  these  grievances  and  examine  each  grievance  on  a  case-by-case  basis  to  ensure  that  the \ncompensation  reflects  the  full  replacement  cost.  This  approach  is  in  line  with  CGV  guidance  and \ninternational standards.  \n\nTilenga project:  the land acquisition conducted by TotalEnergies EP Uganda, on behalf of the Government \nof Uganda, complies with both national laws and best international practice. Following delays in Project \napprovals  which  in  turn  caused  delays  in  the  land  acquisition  process  including  compensation  of  the \nTilenga Project affected persons, a 15% per year uplift is implemented to consider the period between \nplanning and actual start of implementation of Resettlement Action Plans 2, 3a, 3b, 4 and 5. Thus the PAPs \nare receiving a 30% uplift on the value of their land compared to the initial compensation evaluation of \n2018. Payment of compensation for Tilenga Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) 2- 5 started in August 2021 \nand is currently ongoing.  \n\nUntil compensation is paid, the land is still owned by the Project Affected Persons, who are encouraged \nto continue to use their land as normal, farming, planting and harvesting seasonal crops, and maintaining \nhouses and other structures. The Project Affected Persons were informed however that after the cut-off-\ndate for asset valuation, any new development on their land would not be eligible for compensation.  \n\nWhen there may have been some misinterpretation of the  process when the implementation started, \nparticularly to the inventory cut-off date, TotalEnergies remedied the situation as soon as it became aware \nof this, by initiating a targeted and wide-ranging communication plan (increased dialogue and additional \ninformation  with  the  people  concerned,  as  well  as  radio  announcements,  and  posters  and  brochures \ntranslated into local languages). \n\n5-  Stakeholder engagement: \n\nThe promotion of dialogue is at the heart of projects engagement with stakeholders. Regular meetings \nhave  been  held  with  all  the  stakeholders  connected  with  the  project  and  its  installations,  including \nnational, regional and local government in Uganda and Tanzania; Project Affected Communities (PAC) and \nProject Affected People (PAP); traditional and religious authorities; local businesses and tour operators; \nthe  developers  of  the  project’s  installations;  civil  society  coalitions  and  NGOs;  academic  and  research \norganizations; intergovernmental organizations.  \n\n30  Stakeholder  Engagement  Plans  (SEPs)  have  been  set  up  to  establish  and  maintain  open  and \nconstructive relationships between the project’s partners and stakeholders, and to help operations run \nsmoothly, taking account of environmental and social impacts.  \n\nQuarterly stakeholder engagement meetings are held with many groups, and they are regularly reviewed \nto ensure that they properly take account of the questions raised by the participants themselves. In 2021, \nEACOP  in  Tanzania  held  3,094  meetings,  reaching  38,952  stakeholders,  including  1,704  meetings  with \ngovernment authorities and 1,340 meetings at community level.  \n\nIn Uganda, 8,007 meetings were held with PAPs in 2021 (some of which took place during the activities \nconnected to access to land, the conducting of surveys and complaints management). Many methods and \ntools are used to promote dialogue, including village meetings, either with individuals or small groups, \n\n \n\fsite visits and guided tours. The written and visual communication materials have been adapted to the \naudience, using traditional media, including local radio, telecoms, and websites. \n\nIn 2021, EACOP in Tanzania held 3,094 meetings, reaching 38,952 stakeholders, including 1,704 meetings \nwith government authorities and 1,340 meetings at community level.  \n\nOn relations with local communities and liaison officers, the stakeholder engagement teams in the field, \nincluding  community  relations  managers/supervisors  and  community  liaison  officers,  have  established \ngood relations with local government and community representatives. They are maintaining significant \nengagement  and  dialogue,  ensuring  that  the  population  is  well  informed  of  the  project’s  policies  and \nprocesses and operational activities in their area (including land acquisition). They can discuss upcoming \nactivities with them and receive and respond to complaints.  \n\nSpecial attention is given to ensuring that all members of the community are included, especially women \nand vulnerable people who might need a different approach to ensure their full involvement. Particular \nattention has been paid to safeguarding women’s rights by ensuring their presence and involvement at \nkey  steps  of  the  land  acquisition  process  such  as  during  the  land  and  asset  surveys,  disclosure  of \ncompensation  values  and  signing  of  compensation  agreement  (which  includes  spousal  consent). \nAdditionally, joint bank accounts have been opened, and specific livelihood restoration programs targeted \nat women implemented.  \n\nRegarding  engagement  with  Civil  Society  Organizations  (CSOs)  and  Non-Governmental  Organizations \n(NGOs), Uganda has a very diverse NGO and CSO landscape. According to the statistics of the Ugandan \nNGO Office, there were a total of 2,235 registered NGOs in the country on October 25, 2021. Although no \nstatistics are available for Tanzania, there are fewer active NGOs in the oil and gas sector. The project is \nstrongly committed to freedom of speech and appreciates the work of all the NGOs and CSOs and the \nmedia, even when they do not share the same opinions. The teams try to encourage and help the NGOs \nin their activities, provided that they are working legally and peacefully.  \n\nIn Tanzania, there are quarterly meetings between the project team and the NGOs. The team works with \nthe communities and traditional leaders of vulnerable ethnic groups that identify as indigenous people. \nThree Tanzanian NGOs have been supporting this work for over a year. They have taken part in quarterly \nworkshops  with  these  groups’  traditional  leaders  and  help  to  draw  up  community  profiles  for  all \ncommunities directly affected by the project.  \n\nIn Uganda, the project has been engaging for several years with the Civil Society Coalition on Oil and Gas \n(CSCO), a network of over sixty Ugandan NGOs working towards sustainable governance of Uganda’s oil \nand gas resources so as to maximize the benefits to the people of Uganda and regular engagement take \nplace with local CSOs. EACOP has also publicly invited NGOs and CSOs to witness EACOP activities on the \nground.  \n\nProcesses were reviewed by third party against IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social \nSustainability and will continue to be scrutinized during the implementation phase. \n\n \n \n \n\fPlease  note that  a significant  amount  of  information  is  made  available on  Tilenga  and  EACOP  :  acting \ntransparently: \nhttps://totalenergies.com/projects/liquids-low-carbon-fuels/tilenga-and-eacop-acting-\ntransparently \n\n_______"}

The \nreport cites impact of PT Vale Indonesia´s (PT Vale) operations on the residents in East Luwu, \nSouth Sulawesi and Pomalaa, South-East Sulawesi.  \n\nVale  has  always  strived  to  maintain  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with  local  stakeholders \nduring  its  more  than  50  years  of  operation  in  Indonesia.  The  Company  operates  under  high \nenvironmental and  social standards  and  is committed  to  contributing to the  development of \nresilient  communities  and  sustainable  environment  through  corporate  social  responsibility \nprograms.  PT  Vale  has  received  numerous  recognitions  and  awards  from  various  reputable \ninstitutions  among  others,  Green  PROPER  (beyond  compliance)  from  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment  and  Forestry,  and  Trophy  Aditama  (the  highest  ranking  for  environmental \nmanagement) from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. \n\nOne  of  main  pillars  in  Vale´s  strategic  priorities  is  sustainability,  which  is  aligned  with  the \nSustainable  Development  Goals  and  Paris  Agreement  (i.e.,  toward  carbon  neutral  by  2050). \nGlobally, Vale wants to be a carbon neutral corporation and PT Vale is part of this initiative with \na strong focus on looking at ways to reduce carbon emissions. \n\nSince  1978,  PT  Vale  has  been  utilizing  renewable  energy  to  meet  the  energy  demands  of  its \nfurnaces in the refining facility. The Sorowako nickel smelter today already is among the lowest \ncarbon intensity nickel in Indonesia. PT Vale has three hydropower plants with a total capacity \nof  365  MegaWatt  which  have  reduced  the  company’s  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  for  the \nprocessing  plants.  Through  the  operation  of  the  hydropower  plants,  PT  Vale  has  avoided  by \naround  1,000,000  (One  Million)  Tonnes  of  CO2  equivalent  emission  per  year.  In  addition  to \nsupplying  our  operational  needs,  electricity  produced  by  the  three  hydropower  plants  is \ndistributed to meet the needs of the East Luwu community through Perusahaan Listrik Negara \n(a state-owned electricity provider).  \n\nIn tandem with our commitments and practices, Vale clarifies the following points raised in the \nJATAM article. \n\nAllegation of Pollution at the Lampia Sea \n\nThere  was  no  major  impact  coming  out  from  the  oil  spill  as  the  amount  of  oil  involved  was \nmarginal (less than 200 liter) and the spill was immediately contained by oil boom designed to \ncontrol this type of situation. Immediately afterwards, the Company carried out comprehensive \ncleaning activities and monitored the water quality to ensure no impact on marine biota. PT Vale \n\nPage 1 of 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fengaged a reputable institution in Indonesia to carry out a study; it was concluded that the oil \nspill did not create pollution at the Lampia Sea. \n\nAllegation of Pollution and Sediment in Mahalona Lake  \n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forestry carried out an assessment into alleged sedimentation \nin Mahalona Lake in 2020 and found no violations. PT Vale has never received any sanctions \nrelated to this matter. \n\nPT  Vale  continues  to  consistently  manage  water  effluent  and  to  meet  environmental  quality \nstandards  before  flowing  into  water  bodies.  PT  Vale  operates  19  catchment  areas  in  the \nSorowako  and  Petea  area.  These  catchment  areas  have  monitoring  points  to  monitor  and \ncontrol the quality of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), chromium concentrations (CR6+), soluble \nnickel,  oil  separation  and  pH  controls  to  meet  the  Government  standard.  As  part  of  our \ncommitments, since 2013, the Company has been implementing the “Effluent Project” program, \nto  process  liquid  waste  in  an  integrated  manner  by  operating  the  Pakalangkai  Waste  Water \nTreatment (WWT). In 2016, the Company built the Lamella Gravity Settler (LGS) facility which \nhas 17 integrated deposit ponds with a capacity of 16 million cubic meters. In total PT Vale has \nmore than 100 sediment ponds to process wastewater.  \n\nAllegation of Pollution in Mori Island \n\nWith regards to Mori Island, PT Vale engaged an independent and accredited third party (PT \nSucofindo) to follow up on the alleged sulfur spill contamination. Based on the results of the \nToxicity  Characteristic  Leaching  Procedure  (TCLP)  analysis  of  water  and  soil  samples  taken \ntogether  with  the  East  Luwu  Regency  Environment  Agency  (DLH)  and  PT  Sucofindo,  it  was \nconcluded that there is no pollution on Mori Island as per data received on September 20, 2021. \n\nAs  a  form  of  good  will  and  commitment  on  preserving  the  environment,  PT  Vale  and  its \ncontractors have conducted routine inspections on Mori Island. In addition, PT Vale and the East \nLuwu Environmental Agency (DLH) regularly carry out joint inspections on Mori Island. \n\nIn addition to that, based on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), Government Regulation \nNo. 74 of 2001 and Government Regulation No. 22 of 2021, Sulfur is not a Hazardous and Toxic \nMaterial (B3) nor a B3 waste. \n\nSuspicion of taking agricultural land and the land of the indigenous people \n\nVale recognizes that Indigenous Peoples have a profound and special connection with land and \nwater, which are linked to their physical, spiritual, cultural, and economic well-being. They also \ncarry valuable traditional knowledge and experience in managing the environment sustainably.  \n\nMining and metals projects can generate significant impacts on local communities, both positive \nand  negative.  Vale  follows  guidelines  throughout  its  operations  and  projects  to  establish \nrelationships  with  potentially  impacted  indigenous  peoples.  The  company  also  abides  by \ninternational commitments  and  references  related to  indigenous  issues,  such as the  position \nstatement of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) on Mining and Indigenous \nPeoples (2014), the ILO 169 Convention, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \nIndigenous Peoples.  \n\nPage 2 of 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn  Indonesia, PT Vale  continues to  appreciate  the  existence of  community  in the  operational \narea. This is in line with the company's values, i.e., respecting the planet and people. As a public \ncompany, PT Vale has always strived to comply with the laws and regulations in order not to \nimpact rightsholders. \n\nThe  Indonesian  laws  and  regulations  provide  certain  procedures  to  determine  a  legitimate \nindigenous people. Based on the latest study conducted in Luwu Timur by a reputable institution \nin Indonesia and consultation with the local government, we understand there is no indigenous \npeoples in PT Vale’s operational area.  \n\nAllegation  of  criminalization  of  seven  activists  and  indigenous  people  around  the  mine  in \nrelation to a demonstration \n\nFreedom  of  speech,  including  demonstration,  is  protected  under  Indonesian  laws  and \nregulations. PT Vale continues to respect freedom of speech so long as it is conducted as per the \npermissible  boundaries  under  the  regulations  and  does  not \ninvolve  anarchism.  The \ndemonstration  in  March  2022  caused  injuries  to  PT  Vale’s  employee  and  contractor,  and \ndestruction  to  assets.  Police  investigation  was conducted  as  there  was  anarchism  during  the \ndemonstration. \n\nAs an essential component of batteries, nickel producing companies have been urged to increase \ntheir  production  of  class  one  nickel.  Communities,  consumers,  and  investors  are  increasingly \nconscious  of  the  sustainability  performance  of  essential  minerals  producing  companies.  PT \nVale´s long-term track record investments in ensuring sustainable practices, without impacting \nhuman rights, have prepared the Company for this moment.  \n\nFurther information on the work, challenges, and results of the management of PT Vale can be \nfound in its Annual and Sustainability Reports1. \n\nSincerely, \n\nVale, SA. \n\n1 https://www.vale.com/pt/indonesia/annual-and-sustainability-reports?start-tab-1=2 \n\nPage 3 of 3"}

Due to technical issues, it regrettably appears \nthat the emails sent were not recovered until the start of 2023. We can only apologize for this.   \n\nRegarding the points mentioned in the JFI/EGI rejoinder, please find here below our comments: \n\nWith regard to the JFI/EGI statement: “our joint investigations with Ugandan civil society partners have \nfound that the project-affected communities featured in our article say they are continuing to be forced \ninto accepting unilaterally determined compensation, and still face constant threats of involuntary \nresettlement and land acquisition.” \n\nEACOP is a public interest project and thus the land acquisition process is ultimately backstopped by a \nmechanism whereby should PAPs not agree to the terms of the acquisition of land, then the Gov. of \nUganda may deposit their entitlements with a Court of Law (and as such this would be ‘compulsory land \nacquisition process’ very similar to arrangements we have in Europe for Government public interest \nprojects).  With the agreement of the Governments, EACOP has engaged in a consensual manner with \nPAPs in accordance with good international practice such that they sign their compensation agreements \nwithout resort to any compulsory processes.  EACOP does not use or tolerate any form of coercion or \nforce, and always engages with PAPs respectfully.  As per good international practice both legal advice \nand a grievance mechanism are available to the PAPs (and indeed civil society) to address any issues that \nmight arise. \n\nWith regard to the JFI/EGI statement: “TotalEnergies failed to respect the principle of free, prior, and \ninformed consent (FPIC)”. \n\nThis should be noted that, in relation specifically to FPIC, under human rights policy this concept applies \nto indigenous people. There are no groups recognized as indigenous people in Uganda. In Tanzania \nthere are several vulnerable groups self-identifying as Indigenous People along the pipeline route. \n\nEACOP has consulted closely with the four of them impacted by the Project - the Akie, Taturu, Barabaig \nand Maasai to meet all IFC PS 7 substantive requirements in preparation for land access.  EACOP \napproach to engagement with these groups includes:  \n\n•  Ongoing consultation and engagement since November 2019, \n\n•  Engagement of a Tanzanian indigenous peoples’ specialist to undertake more culturally specific \n\nengagements and facilitate the discussion and negotiation of key agreements, \n\n \n\f•  Ongoing support through NGOs trusted by the traditional leaders and communities including the \n\nPastoralist Indigenous Non-Governmental Forum (PINGOs Forum), Parakuiyo Pastoralists \nIndigenous Community Development Organization (PAICODEO) and Ujaama Community \nResources Team (UCRT), \n\n•  Negotiation and signing by the traditional leaders of The EACOP Framework for Vulnerable \n\nEthnic Groups self-identifying as Indigenous Peoples in October 2021,  \n\n•  Re-routing of the pipeline alignment in specific locations to avoid cultural sites and landscape \nfeatures that Vulnerable Ethnic Groups self-identifying as Indigenous Peoples identified as \nhaving cultural or spiritual significance, \n\n•  Negotiation and signing of a Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) Agreement between EACOP \n\nand the Akie Community of Napilikunya in July 2022 – the first of its kind in Tanzania, \n\n•  Negotiation and signing by the traditional leaders of The EACOP Plan for Vulnerable Ethnic \n\nGroups Self-Identifying as Indigenous Peoples September 2022, \n\nWith regard to the JFI/EGI statement: “Project-affected men and women have emphasized to JFI and \nlocal partners that their rights to health, decent housing, and adequate standards of living continue to be \nviolated.” \n\nPlease note that we strongly refute these accusations. Many of these allegations pre-date the time \nwhen EACOP actually occupied any land (only in 2021 for specific areas in Tanzania, and 2nd Feb 2023 for \nthe first Priority Area in Uganda).  Most of the main right of way will only follow in 2023.  Consequently, \nEACOP has not done anything, other than in these specific areas at the dates mentioned, to prevent \nPAPs to live on and use their land and indeed has encouraged them to do so.   \n\nWe repeat that we have grievance mechanisms with effective remediation in place. In the event that \nyou become aware of a complaint, we invite you to contact us and refer them to those mechanisms. \nMoreover, if partner organizations wish us to look into individual cases, we would be happy to do so. \n\nIn the JFI/EGI rejoinder we have noted that you also mentioned that: “It appears that TotalEnergies and \nthe EACOP Consortium have not adequately developed and implemented environmental and social due \ndiligence measures to identify and remedy the irreversible environmental and social impacts of the \npipeline...” \n\nTotalEnergies reiterates that this project is major for Uganda and Tanzania and commits to do its utmost \nto make this exemplary project in terms of transparency, shared prosperity, economic and social \nprogress, sustainable development, environmental accountability, and respect for human rights.   \n\nConcerning EACOP and its associated upstream facilities, a third party Environmental and Social due \ndiligence has been carried out, lasting more than 2 years, against the 8 IFC Performance Standards.  It \nfinds no ‘red flag’ and that EACOP is either compliant, or on track to be compliant in a timely manner \ncommensurate with the advancement of the project, across its activities.  \n\nWith regard to the resolution of the EU parliament, please also note that TotalEnergies expressed their \nreaction in a press release dated Oct 10th, 2022.  “If, as one might expect within the framework of \ncontradictory debate respecting the fundamental principles of the institutions of our democracies, \nTotalEnergies had been consulted prior to the passing of this resolution, the Company could have \ninformed the Parliament the inaccuracy of many elements which are based on serious and unfounded \n\n\fallegations. Unfortunately, it is now too late for this contradictory debate to take place as the European \nParliament adopted this resolution without even hearing the Company.”  \n\nThere were also repudiation statements made by the Ugandan and Tanzanian Authorities. \n\nIn the JFI/EGI rejoinder, you also state that : “According to the EACOP consortium’s Resettlement Action \nPlan, nearly 25,000 individuals in Uganda are affected by the EACOP project and over 200 households \nneed to be resettled. TotalEnergies’ contradicting estimates of the actual number PAPs contradicts the \n18,700 Project Affected Persons mentioned in the company's response to Just Finance International.” \n\nThere is some confusion in this statement. \n\nThe 18700 Project Affected Persons are the total number of PAPs (broadly corresponding to households, \nalthough they can be other institutions) aggregated across the Tilenga Upstream project, EACOP Uganda \nand EACOP Tanzania. For EACOP in Uganda there are 3648 PAPs of whom 203 are physically displaced.  \nThe remainder are economically impacted, meaning the project impacts structures, land, crops and \ntrees in full or in part.   \n\nWith  regard  to  the  JFI/EGI  statement  mentioning  that:  “The  EACOP  consortium  must  also  respect  the \ncultural beliefs and customs of Indigenous  communities throughout  project implementation such as  by \nproviding  compensation  for  the  destruction  of  graves  and  the  cutting  down  of  holy  trees.  Local \ncommunities have reported that they have not always received compensation for the loss and damage to \nthese spiritual sites, despite their great significance.”. EACOP is carrying out culturally appropriate grave \nand shine relocations, compensating cultural heritage sites and providing relocation support in a manner \nadapted  to  the  customs  of  each  affected  person.  EACOP  also  uses  the  services  of  archaeologists  and \ncultural heritage specialists. \n\n_______________"}

The Volkswagen Group takes its corporate responsibility very seriously. \nRespect for human rights is the ethical basis of our business activities. We stand for individual \nfreedom, fair working conditions, open world trade, economic development and peaceful \ncoexistence, and we condemn any form of discrimination. Therefore, we reject forced labor and all \nforms of modern slavery including human trafficking. \n\nAutomobile supply chains are vast and complex.  Nevertheless, Volkswagen Group (VWG) would like \nto assure you that we take indications of forced labor in the supply chain very seriously.  Despite the \nnumerous challenges we face—including, among others, regulatory challenges, a lack of available \nverification tools, limited business partner readiness to co-operate and difficulties in accessing local \ndata in China—we share the goal of combatting forced labor in global supply chains. Therefore, \nBusiness Partners must reject all conscious use of forced and compulsory labor as well as all forms of \nmodern slavery and human trafficking. Bonded labor or involuntary prison labor are not acceptable. \nWe require that employment relationships are entered into on a voluntary basis and may be \nterminated by employees at their own discretion and within a reasonable notice period.    \n\nOur sustainability requirements for business partners are based on national and international \nprovisions and conventions, such as the principles of the UN Global Compact, the Business Charter \nfor Sustainable Development of the International Chamber of Commerce, the OECD Guidelines for \nMultinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the relevant \nconventions of the International Labor Organization, as well as the Guiding Principles to Enhance \nSustainability Performance in the Supply Chain released by the Drive Sustainability partnership. Our \nsustainability requirements (including those addressing forced labor) are anchored in our Code of \nConduct for Business Partners. Since 2019, we have been assessing the sustainability performance of \nour relevant business partners with a Sustainability Rating prior to making final sourcing decisions. \nThe analysis and evaluation of the sustainability performance of our business partners is carried out \nby means of a self-assessment questionnaire. Risk-based on-site audits are carried out after an initial \nanalysis of supplier data. To date, we have conducted over 50 audits in raw material supply chains \nand over 4,300 sustainability on-site reviews at direct suppliers’ locations (including employee \ninterviews, review of working conditions, etc.).   \n\nIn 2020, VWG adopted a Raw Material Due Diligence Management System, which focuses on high-\nrisk raw materials (risk factors include, e.g., child and forced labor). Our targets for responsible raw \nmaterial sourcing are set within this Raw Material Due Diligence Management System. In order to \nincrease transparency in our supply chains we have conducted mappings and, for specific raw \nmaterials, such as cobalt, we are conducting extensive forensic supplier audits.  With respect to \nbattery raw materials, one of our objectives is to gain 100% supply chain transparency and assure \nthat suppliers meet our requirements, including at mine site level, through ambitious mapping and \nauditing efforts. As part of our use of the Raw Material Due Diligence Management System, VWG \nhas been requiring in all new contracts the full disclosure of suppliers in the supply chain (i.e., up to \nthe mine) for battery raw materials.  \n\nVWG maintains a Supply Chain Grievance Mechanism through which we learn about supply chain-\nrelated allegations, including allegations of sub-suppliers using forced labor. Upon learning of \nallegations regarding direct or indirect suppliers, including based on hints coming from publicly \navailable research articles or Reports, VWG investigates them immediately using the Supply Chain \nGrievance Mechanism. Serious violations such as those relating to forced labor could result in \ntermination or non-renewal of the contract with the sup-plier if mitigation measures fail. The \n\nJanuary 27, 2023 \n\n \n \n\fmechanism is accessible via our website, an email address and an anonymized channel and is open \nto all stakeholders and potentially affected persons such as employees of suppliers, social \norganizations or representatives of communities in the immediate vicinity of our production sites.  \n\nIn case of the Report “Driving Force” from the Sheffield Hallam University, we are currently in the \nprocess of investigation and assessment and contacted mentioned companies connected to \nVolkswagen Group. This process is still ongoing. \n\nJanuary 27, 2023"}

It is a decision we made with conviction, \ncarefully aligned with government guidance and in compliance with sanctions, which do not exclude \npurchasing products refined from Russian crude in third countries where this is legally permitted.  \n\n“We acknowledge the difficult dilemma that governments face between putting pressure on the \nRussian government and ensuring stable, secure and affordable energy supplies for consumers in the \nrest of the world, including Ukraine.”  \n\nENDS \n\nBackground Information: \n\n•  We have already stopped purchasing Russian-origin petroleum products. Through a range of \ncontrols, including strict no Russian-origin product contract clauses with suppliers, we seek \nto avoid any fuels that may contain products refined in Russia (ie where they may have been \nblended further up the supply chain).   \n\n•  Other refinery-operating companies in third countries may import Russian crude to \n\ntransform it. Often this is done in refineries using a mix of crude feedstocks from different \nsources. In compliance with sanctions and aligned with government guidance, Shell does not \ncurrently exclude purchasing products that may have been refined from Russian crude by \nthird parties in such countries. \n\n•  To be clear, products manufactured outside Russia are not considered Russian origin. For \n\ninstance, under US Customs laws “Russian Federation origin” excludes goods that have been \n“incorporated or substantially transformed into a foreign-made product”. We will always \ncomply with applicable sanctions and local laws."}

Las actividades de la Fundación son monitoreadas (i) por las entidades públicas \ncompetentes,  a  través  del  Comité  Interfederativo  (\"CIF\");  (ii)  por  el  Poder  Judicial,  en  los \ndenominados  Ejes  Temáticos  Prioritarios  en  curso  en  el  TRF-6,  incluyendo  la  pericia  técnica \njudicial ; (iii) por auditorías externas independientes, todo ello en la forma del convenio que dio \nlugar a su constitución (TTAC/TAC-Gov), así como por el velo legal del propio Ministerio Público.  \n\nLos montos reportados como realizados son debidamente registrados en los estados financieros \nde  la Fundación,  siendo  PwC responsable de  su  auditoría  contable anual. Todos los informes \nanuales de auditoría son remitidos al CIF, al Ministerio Público y publicados en la página web, \nestando actualmente en elaboración el informe 2022. \nLos  estados  financieros  auditados  de  Renova  de  2016  a  2021  se  pueden  consultar  en \nhttps://www.fundacaorenova.org/a-fundacao/. \n\nLa veracidad del crecimiento del 54% en el pago de indemnizaciones por el sistema simplificado \nde  indemnizaciones  (Novel)  en  2022,  en  comparación  con  los  pagos  en  2021,  puede \ncomprobarse, además de la información divulgada por Renova, por los propios convenios, que \nse firman en el ámbito del Régimen Simplificado de Remuneración (Novel), sistema fiscalizado \njudicialmente (Eje N° 7), y aprobado por el 4º Juzgado Federal. Los pagos sólo se realizan después \nde dicha aprobación judicial, por lo que los montos informados por Renova son debidamente \ncontrolados por el Poder Judicial. \n\nEl valor de R$ 1,7 mil millones en acciones socioambientales mencionado en el artículo se refiere \nsólo  a  inversiones  estimadas  en  programas  de  recuperación  de  Áreas  de  Preservación \nPermanente y Nacientes, que se espera sean desembolsados hasta 2030, y no a la totalidad de \nlas acciones socioambientales o restauración forestal.  \n\nLa información actualizada sobre los trabajos de reparación se puede encontrar accediendo al \nsitio web de la Fundación Renova: https://www.fundacaorenova.org/dadosdareparacao/ . \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFinalmente,  la  acusación  de  que  Vale  es  supuestamente  un  acreedor  “privilegiado”  con  una \nposición destacada en la recuperación judicial de Samarco también es infundada. Las deudas de \nVale con Samarco están debidamente legítimas y registradas en los estados contables de esta \núltima.  \n\nDespués  de  la  presentación  de  la  declaración  de  concurso  judicial  por  parte  de  Samarco, \ncualquier  nuevo  financiamiento  otorgado  a  Samarco  (por  Vale  o  por  terceros)  se  considera \nextraconcursal,  y  su  pago  no  está  sujeto  a  ese  proceso.  Las  contribuciones  eventualmente \nrealizadas  después  de  la  solicitud  de  recuperación  judicial  de  Vale  a  la  Fundação Renova,  en \ncumplimiento del compromiso asumido por ella en el TTAC de hacer el 50% de las eventuales \ncontribuciones  anuales  no  hechas  por  Samarco,  son  por  naturaleza  no  concursales  y,  por  lo \ntanto, su el pago también está sujeto a la competencia establecida en el concurso judicial.  \n\nVale reafirma  su  compromiso  de  continuar  brindando apoyo  para la  reparación  de  los  daños \ncausados por la ruptura de la represa de Fundão, en los términos del TTAC y TAC-Governança. \nHasta  el  31/12/2022,  más  de  410  mil  personas  habían  sido  indemnizadas  y  ya  se  habían \ndestinado más de 28 mil millones de reales para acciones realizadas por la Fundación Renova.  \n\nValoramos la oportunidad de un diálogo continuo con los Business and Human Rights Resource \nCentre como con otros stakeholders acerca de este importante compromiso.

Passados sete anos, ainda há trabalho a ser feito, mas \nevidências demonstram que houve um progresso significativo em direção à reparação, dentro do escopo \ndos 42 programas sob a responsabilidade da Fundação Renova.    \n\nA BHP Brasil segue totalmente comprometida ao contínuo apoio nas ações de reparação e compensação. \nNo total, a Fundação Renova destinou R$ 28,1 bilhões em programas de remediação e compensação até \n31 de dezembro de 2022, com indenizações e assistência financeira pagas a aproximadamente 410.000 \npessoas e aproximadamente 70% dos casos de reassentamento concluídos. Um panorama completo de \ntodas  as  entregas  já  realizadas  pela  Renova  está  disponível  na  página  “Dados  da  Reparação” \n(www.fundacaorenova.org.br/dadosdareparacao), e é atualizado mensalmente.  \n\nSobre o tópico em questão, é importante ressaltar que: \n\n•  A Fundação Renova, criada a partir do Termo de Transação de Ajustamento de Conduta (TTAC), \nassinado em março de 2016 entre a Samarco, suas acionistas, e os governos Federal, Estaduais \nde Minas Gerais e do Espírito Santo e outras entidades, é uma entidade autônoma e independente, \ndedicada, de forma integral e exclusiva, a implementar e gerir os programas e ações de reparação \ne compensação de danos decorrentes do rompimento de Fundão. \n\n•  A atuação da Fundação Renova é baseada na transparência e no diálogo com a sociedade. Os \nprocessos da instituição são acompanhados e fiscalizados, continuamente, por auditorias externas \nindependentes, que acompanham a evolução dos programas), seguindo as diretrizes impostas nas \ncláusulas 198, 200 e 201 do referido Termo de Transação de Ajustamento de Conduta (TTAC). \n•  O modelo de governança da Fundação Renova inclui um Conselho Fiscal, composto por membros \nde  diferentes  entidades,  incluindo  indicações  do  governo  federal  e  governos  estaduais,  com \nresponsabilidade de fiscalizar as contas da instituição.  \n\n•  A Fundação Renova mantém em, seu portal da transparência (disponível em https://transparencia-\nfundacaorenova.hub.arcgis.com/)  informações  atualizadas  sobre  o  dispêndio  nos  diversos \nprogramas sob sua responsabilidade, além dos relatórios das auditorias financeiras independentes \nhttps://www.fundacaorenova.org/arquivos-e-\n(disponíveis \nrelatorios/?search=demonstrativo+financeiro&category=&forum=&data_inicio=&data_fim=). \n\nem: \n\n•  Ainda,  o  TTAC  constituiu  o  Comitê  Interfederativo  (CIF),  um  sistema  colegiado  que  reúne \nrepresentantes dos órgãos públicos e da sociedade e que é liderado pelo Ibama. O CIF funciona \ncomo  uma  instância  externa  e  independente  da  Fundação  Renova,  com  a  função  de  orientar, \nacompanhar, monitorar e fiscalizar a execução das medidas de reparação.

Seven years later, while there is still work to be done, evidence shows that \nthere has been significant progress towards remediation, within the scope of the 42 programs under the \nRenova Foundation's responsibility. \n\nBHP Brasil has been and remains fully committed to continue the ongoing support to the reparation and \ncompensation  actions.  In  total,  the  Renova  Foundation  has  spent  R$28.1  billion  on  remediation  and \ncompensation  programs  to  31  December  2022,  with  compensation  and  financial  assistance  paid  to \napproximately 410,000 people and approximately 70 per cent of resettlement cases completed. A complete \noverview  of  all  deliveries  already  made  by  Renova  can  be  found  on  the  “Repair  Data”  page \n(www.fundacaorenova.org.br/repairdata), and is updated monthly. \n\nOn the topic in question, it is important to reinforce that: \n\n•  The Renova Foundation, created by the Conduct Adjustment Agreement (TTAC), signed in March \n2016  between  Samarco,  its  shareholders,  and  the  Federal,  Minas  Gerais  and  Espírito  Santo \ngovernments and other entities, is a autonomous and independent entity dedicated full-time and \nexclusively to implementing and managing programs and actions for repairing and compensating \ndamages resulting from Samarco’s Fundão dam failure. \n\n•  The  work  of  the  Renova  Foundation  is  based  on  transparency  and  dialogue  with  society.  The \ninstitution's processes are permanently monitored and supervised by independent external auditors, \nfollowing  the  guidelines  imposed  in  clauses  198,  200  and  201  of  the  aforementioned  Conduct \nAdjustment Transaction Term (TTAC). \n\n•  Renova  Foundation's  governance  model  includes  a  Fiscal  Board,  composed  of  members  from \ndifferent entities, including appointments from the federal and state governments, with responsibility \nfor overseeing the institution's accounts. \n\n•  The Renova Foundation maintains, in its transparency portal (available at https://transparencia-\n\nfundacaorenova.hub.arcgis.com/) up-to-date information on expenditure on the various programs \nunder its responsibility, in addition to reports from independent financial audits (available at: \nhttps://www.fundacaorenova.org/arquivos-e-\nrelatorios/?search=demonstrativo+financeiro&category=&forum=&data_inicio=&data_fim=). \n•  Furthermore, the TTAC established the Interfederative Committee (IFC), a collegiate system that \nbrings together representatives of public bodies and society and which is led by Ibama (Brazilian \ninstitute for the environment and renewable natural resources). The IFC works as an external and \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\findependent instance of the Renova Foundation, with the function of guiding, accompanying, \nmonitoring and supervising the execution of reparation measures.

The  Foundation  also  has  a  Human  Rights  Respect  Program  that  aims  to \nimplement  specific  Guidelines  aimed  at  respecting  these  Rights  in  its  processes  and  programs, \nunder the management of the Human Rights Management. \n\n•  Guided by the UNGPs with respect to the important role of operational-level grievance mechanisms, \nFundação  Renova  has  two  channels  for  listening  and  receiving  complaints:  i.  the  Ombudsman, \ndedicated to receiving, registering and investigating denouncements and complaints related to the \ncommunities affected by the Fundão dam failure, in Mariana (MG). These manifestations are dealt \nwith  by  the  Renova  Foundation  Ombudsman  area.  E-mail:  ouvidoria@fundacaorenova.org, \ntelephone: 0800 721 0717 and; ii. A confidential channel aimed at receiving reports on corporate \nmatters, related to non-compliance with the code of conduct, internal rules or current legislation by \nour employees, contracted or subcontracted third parties. All reports received on the Confidential \nChannel  are  handled  by \nthe  Compliance  area  of  Fundação  Renova.

There are even court decisions attesting to the legitimacy of BHP Brasil's interests \nin said process. We trust in Samarco's judicial reorganization process as a way to ensure that Samarco \ncontinues to be able to finance Renova, is operationally and financially sustainable, as well as provides a \nfair return to Samarco's creditors. \n\nWe are grateful for the ongoing dialogue with the Information Center on Business and Human Rights on \nmatters of paramount importance such as this one. We believe that respecting human rights and contributing \nto the realisation of rights is not only critical to our business, it is the right thing to do. We see human rights \nas critical to our ability to contribute meaningful and ongoing social value to our stakeholders. Simply put, \nour success depends upon how well we respect the rights of individuals and groups who interact with and \nare impacted by our business operations and relationships. \n\nWe remain at your disposal for any clarification. \n\nYours sincerely, \n\nCarla Wilson \nGeneral Manager Brazil"}

We do not tolerate any threats, intimidation, \nharassment or violence against those exercising their Human Rights to freedom of expression to protest \npeacefully  against  our  business  or  activities.  We  take  seriously  any  allegations  of  reprisals” \nhttps://corporate.totalenergies.ug/system/files/atoms/files/human_rights_policy.pdf \n\nhttps://eacop.com/human-rights-policy/ \n\nIn  addition,  in  Uganda  regarding  HRDs,  a  Statement  was  issued  by  the  General  Manager  of  TEPU  in \nDecember 2022. This statement emphasizes that TEPU seeks to promote dialogue  and exchanges with \nHRDs in the framework of its activities and sets out a commitment to act where it is alerted to allegations \nof threats, intimidation, harassment or violence against HRDs in relation to its activities. The statement \nalso reiterates the various means which HRDs can use for making complaints or raising alerts in relation \nto the Project. \n https://corporate.totalenergies.ug/system/files/atoms/files/statement_on_human_rights_defenders_word.pdf \n\nAny  allegations  of  harassment  and  threats  against  HRDs  and  NGOs  in  relation  to  the  Projects  are \nconsidered  in  the  subsidiaries’  Human  Rights  Committees.  The  Projects  regularly  encourage  their \nstakeholders including NGOs to inform them immediately if they have knowledge of concrete incidents or \nevents providing sufficient detail for investigations to be carried out. \n\nThe  Projects  are  cognicent  of  their  role  in  encouraging  other  actors  to  respect  human  rights  of  all \nstakeholders  including  HRDs,  and  in  order  to  exercise  leverage  they  regularly  repeat  the  following \nmessage including in meetings with the authorities:  \n\nTEPU is strongly committed to the defense of Human Rights in all its activities. In particular TEPU \nrecognizes the importance of protecting Human Rights Defenders and does not tolerate any attack \nor threats against those who peacefully promote Human Rights in relations to its activities. TEPU \nseeks to promote dialogue and exchanges with Human Rights Defenders in the framework of its \nactivities.  Where  appropriate  as  recommended  by  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and \nHuman Rights, TEPU seeks to exert its leverage to influence others to respect these principles. \n\n \n \n \n\fGovernment Security Forces and Private Security Companies \n\nTEPU is aware there is an expectation by civil society that the company will exercise its leverage when \nmade aware of allegations related to Human Rights Defenders in proximity to its activities and as such in \nApril 2021, Michel Forst, an independent consultant, specialized in Human Rights and former Rapporteur \non the situation of Human Rights Defenders for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights (OHCHR) was commissioned by TEPU to provide a report.  \n\nThe  report  is  in  the  public  domain  Human-Rights-Defenders-Report-2021.pdf  (totalenergies.com)  and \nincludes  a  number  of  recommendations.  The  subsidiary  has  subsequently  taken  action  towards \nimplementing these.  \n\nThe Company notes that the allegations of HRDs’ rights violations raised by the Business & Human Rights \nResource Centre are made against authorities rather than TotalEnergies subsidiaries or the Projects. TEPU \nand EACOP representatives interact on a continuous basis with Government Security Forces, including \ndistrict police and national military forces, and Private Guarding & Security Companies which are deployed \nin the area of TEPU activities with the aim of promoting good practices. \n\nThe Project has a programme for continuous implementation of the Voluntary Principles on Security \nand  Human  Rights  (VPSHR),  notably  through  the  negotiation  of  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding \nrelating to VPSHR between TEPU and the Government Security Forces; ongoing VPSHR and human rights \ntraining of both Government Security Forces and Private Security Companies deployed in the Project \narea; and ongoing efforts to ensure that the Project’s grievance mechanisms for community members \nand workers are effective and able to receive complaints about the conduct of Government Security \nForces  or  Private  Security  Companies  without  retaliation.  More  detail  on  interaction  with  Private \nSecurity Companies and Government Security Forces can be found in the company VPHSR report 1  \n\nMeetings and Coordination with Human Rights Defenders and NGOs \n\nEngagements and meetings with various national Coalitions and NGOs for the protection of HRDs regularly \noccur including detailed discussions on expectations on companies with respect to the civic space. \n\nIn addition, coordination meetings on matters relevant to Human Rights Defenders occur with relevant \ninternational organizations. As an example, meetings with the EU Committee on Democratic Governance \nand  Human  Rights  have  taken  place  including  a  presentation  on  the  Tilenga  Human  Rights  Impact \nAssessment focusing on Human Rights Defenders matters. Equally regular coordination meetings occur \nwith both the Office of the High Commission on Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ugandan Human Rights \nCommission. \n\nOn 3 May 2022, which is celebrated as World Press Freedom Day, Senior Management representatives \nattended an event with the Uganda Journalism Association (UJA) to raise awareness of the importance of \nthe human right to freedom of expression. \n\nInformation related to Cases raised by Business & Human Rights Resource Centre \n\n+++++++++ \n\n1https://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/documents/2022-04/vpshr_annual_report_2021_totalenergies.pdf \n\n \n \n \n \n\f- \n\nIndividual’s home and offices raided on Feb 1st 2022.  \n\nInformation on BHRRC website : Kayinga Muddu Yisito is the Network Co-ordinator for Community \nTransformation Foundation Network (COTFONE) and one of the petitioners who challenged Total in \ncourt to stop the EACOP project in Uganda. In February 2022, Yisito's home and offices were raided, \nallegedly in retaliation to his human rights work. \n\nFollowing information received about the break-in of these premises, EACOP staff immediately contacted \nthe  individual  in  question since  both  TEPU  and EACOP  have  well-developed  communications  channels \nwith this organization having entered into dialogue with them since mid-2021 with a view to establishing \ndialogue and creating a pathway for mutual exchange of information. Indeed this organization was part \nof a group of NGOs invited to observe the EACOP land valuation disclosure process. \n\nFollowing such contact to show concern and seek further information, TEPU also contacted the Oil and \nGas police to raise awareness of this case. EACOP and TEPU then put Mr Kayinga Muddu Yisito of COTFONE \nin touch with the EU Delegation in Uganda who provided support thereafter. TEPU verified that the EU \nDelegation had followed up on this. \n\n-  Detentions following a demonstration on Oct 5th 2022.  \n\nInformation  on  BHRRC  website:  A  group  of  students  were  arrested  for  holding  a  peaceful \ndemonstration in support of the recent European Union resolution calling for the delay of the \nEast  African  Crude  Oil  Pipeline  (EACOP).  On  5th  October  2022,  nine  students  from  various \nuniversities  across  the  country  were  remanded  to  Luzira  prison  on  allegations  that  they \nparticipated in an illegal demonstration.  \n\n#STOP EACOP protests occur from time to time in Uganda although numbers of protestors are generally \nlimited. The largest such protest occurred in the wake of the EU Parliamentarian Resolution in relation to \nthe  Project.  Whenever  the  Projects  are  aware  that  protests  are  occurring  members  of  staff  are \nimmediately mobilised to the site of the protests to verify that protestors are being treated in accordance \nwith the law and that no abuse or violence occurs against them. Follow up also occurs where arrests are \nmade again to respectfully request the authorities that the protestors are dealt with in accordance with \nthe law and human rights. \n\nIn relation to the October 2022 protests, EACOP followed up closely with the Director of the Oil & Gas \nPolice  in  particular  emphasizing  the  importance  of  engaging  in  discussions  with  demonstrators.  It  is \nimportant to note that the reasons for the arrests was that the demonstrators had not sought clearance \nin line with the legal requirements for public gatherings. \n\nIndeed, it is important to note that, as is the case in many European countries, it is illegal to hold a public \ndemonstration without first giving prior notice to the authorities. None of the demonstrations mentioned \nhere were declared in advance to the authorities which in most cases is the reason why the protesters \nwere arrested.  \n\nTEPU values the work of all NGOs and activists and respects their freedom of expression even when they \ndo not share the same views as TEPU. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fArrests occurring on Dec 9th 2022.  \n\nInformation on BHRRC website : On 9 December 2022, human rights defenders Barigye Bob, \nIvan Kabale, Musoke Hamis Walusimbi, and Ssemwanga Jackson were arrested violently by the \npolice without an arrest warrant. The four defenders are members of the global campaign Stop \nthe  East  African  Crude  Oil  Pipeline  (StopEACOP).  The  campaign  is  led  by  an  alliance  of  local \ngroups,  communities,  and  African  and  international  organizations  protesting  against  the \nconstruction of the East African Crude Oil pipeline (EACOP).  \n\nUpon hearing through Twitter about a protest on 9 December 2022 the Company sent a representative \nto the central police station to check the status of the anti-EACOP activists. The representative was able \nto confirm that none of the persons arrested had been injured contrary to some information on the social \nmedia. In parallel the Oil and Gas Police were informed and support requested to provide information and \nensure that the situation was kept under control and human rights of the protestors respected. Regular \nfollow up occurred until the protestors were released. \n\nEarly  2023  TEPU  and  EACOP  reached  out  to  several  students  who  had  been  part  of  these  and  similar \nprotests. Through the organisation of breakfast meetings and discussions a meaningful dialogue has been \nestablished and has been greatly appreciated by the students who have complimented that Projects on \nthis proactive approach which has allowed them an alternative means to give voice to their concerns. \n\n++++++"}

We welcome having the opportunity to respond to \nthese allegations and for our response to be published in BHRRC’s weekly update newsletter.  \n\nPresence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) \nGlencore has been present in the DRC for 15 years and today operates the KCC and Mutanda \nMining (MUMI) industrial assets. Our presence has contributed to the establishment and \nexpansion of the extractive sector, supported the development of the local economy and \ndelivered socio-economic benefits to the Katanga region.  \n\nTo date, Glencore has invested over $8 billion in KCC and MUMI’s development. Together, \nKCC and MUMI directly employ around 8,500 people with an approximate additional 8,000 hired \nas contractors. During 2022, we paid $1.1 billion in taxes and royalties to the DRC government. \n\nExternal commitments \nWe participate in a wide range of external initiatives, supporting our commitment to ongoing \nimprovements to our approach and performance across sustainability topics. Our engagement \nvaries from reporting on our progress to taking a role in driving strategic change.  \n\nWe are signatories to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), aligning our strategies and \noperations with its principles, which cover human rights, labour, environment and anti-\ncorruption. We recognise the UNGC’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their \nsystematic global approach to society’s overall development. We believe that we can play a role \nin supporting our host governments to meet the SDGs.  \n\nWe are committed to upholding the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on \nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \nand the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. \n\nWe have been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2014. \nWe endorse its Mining Principles, are active in its working groups and are preparing to report \nagainst its Performance Expectations in 2023. We have committed to report against ICMM’s \nSocial and Economic Reporting Framework, published in May 2022.  The Framework’s \nindicators include a comparison of entry level employee salaries to local living wage. In line with \nthe ICMM’s disclosure deadline, we will publicly report on these indicators for the first time in \n2024. \n\nLiving wage disclosures \nTo prepare for this living wage disclosure, we developed a methodology to evaluate the current \nstatus of our employee salaries (including benefits) against local living wage data. We are \nworking with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) on the provision of local living wage \ninformation as a comparison of the payroll and benefits data relating to our employees.  \n\nAs a pilot for external reporting in 2024, we compared the 2022 local living wages and entry \nlevel salaries for a selection of our operating countries, including the DRC. We are pleased to \nreport that all of our DRC employees meet the requirements of a living wage compared to the \nBSR calculation. This includes health and education benefits – all our DRC employees and their \ndependents benefit from healthcare support, and we also provide employees with an education \nallowance for their children.  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\fWe continually review salaries and discuss them with union representatives to ensure that our \nwages are competitive in the market and keep pace with inflation. We believe that this approach \nallows us to attract and retain local talent in the DRC, which is critical to our ongoing success.  \n\nUtilising contractors \nCurrently, our comparison of employee salaries to local living wages only covers direct \nemployees. Glencore’s Supplier Code of Conduct requires companies supplying contractors to \ncomply with all applicable laws, including those concerning labour rights. Our Supplier Code of \nConduct also sets an expectation that our suppliers respect the ILO Core Labour Standards, \ntreat their workers fairly and with respect and respects the rights to lawful freedom of \nassociation and collective bargaining.  \n\nWe expect our suppliers to offer fair and transparent terms and conditions of employment \nincluding fair remuneration, working hours and working conditions. In addition, the DRC \nProvincial Labour Inspector conducts an annual inspection to ensure all employees, including \nthose employed as contractors, receive the minimum wage and comply with DRC labour law.   \n\nKCC’s Enterprise Development Process works across its procurement programme to support, \nencourage and engage Congolese-owned businesses. KCC’s supplier agreements are required \nto contain standard terms and conditions on the requirement for robust health and safety \nmanagement programmes, upholding respect for human rights, the prevention of child labour, \ngood working conditions and fair salaries. \n\nIn addition, since 2020, KCC has successfully participated in the Responsible Minerals \nInitiative’s programme for its Responsible Minerals Assurance Process. Supplier due diligence \nwas a core part of this third-party assessment. The report on this assessment is available on our \nwebsite. \n\nAddressing Raid UK’s concerns \nWe appreciate the attention given by Raid UK to an important topic such as the living wage, \nwhich is relevant to a broad range of employers and jurisdictions. When choosing BSR as our \nconsultant for local living wages, we considered a number of factors in the selection process, \nincluding: \n\n•  Strong external review by international organisations and academia \n•  Application across a range of countries; and \n•  A strong track record of practical implementation to serve as a benchmark for \n\nmultinational companies. \n\nHowever, we are aware that there are other living wage calculation methodologies, suggesting a \nneed for collaboration around harmonisation in calculation methodologies. Raid UK is well \nplaced to participate and contribute to such discussions.  \n\nIn the DRC, the government plays a primary role in evaluating wage levels, making sure that \nsalaries consider both social and economic objectives and are fair compensation for labour. In \nthe first instance, we would recommend Raid UK address their concerns on the living wage \nthrough engagement with the DRC Ministry of Labour. \n\nIn addition, we recommend that Raid UK speaks with the Federation des Entreprises du Congo \n(FEC). The FEC is a key forum for the DRC business community, serving as a multi-stakeholder \nplatform to discuss issues that affect a broad range of businesses across the country. At a \nnational level, the FEC has relationships with government and unions. At a regional and \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\finternational level, they also collaborate with other membership organisations and international \ninstitutions. Their network supports their ability to convene actors and promote dialogue on \nissues like living wage. \n\nGlencore responded to Raid UK’s queries on the salaries and benefits of our employees in the \nDRC and we continue to welcome constructive dialogue on this topic. \n\nKind regards,  \n\nAnna Krutikov \nGroup Head of Sustainable Development"}

Sie insinuieren etwa,  dass mit einem Audit „die tatsächli­\n\nchen Zustände im Werk( .. ) verschleiern\" werden sollsten.  Das Gegenteil ist \n\nrichtig. Das Thema Wirtschaft und Menschenrechte ist ein fester Bestandteil \n\nunseres Selbstverständnisses und unseres Verhaltenskodex. Der Volkswagen \n\nKonzern hält sich eng an die  Leitprinzipien der Vereinten Nationen für Wirt­\n\nschaft und Menschenrechte. Darüber hinaus haben wir im Volkswagen Kon­\n\nzern durch Vereinbarung der Sozialpartner eigene hohe Standards gesetzt, \n\ndie für uns verpflichtend sind.  Weltweit arbeiten wir mit unseren Partnern an \n\nder Einhaltung dieser Werte. \n\nIn der Vergangenheit sind wir unserer Verantwortung auch am Standort \n\nUrumqi gerecht geworden,  obwohl es sich hierbei nicht um ein eigenes Werk \n\nder Volkswagen AG handelt.  Das Werk in Urumqi wird betrieben von der 2012 \n\ngegründeten SAIC-Volkswagen (Xinjiang) Automotive Co.,  Ltd.,  einer Tochter­\n\ngesellschaft unserer nicht-kontrollierten Beteiligung SAIC Volkswagen Auto­\n\nmotive Co.,  Ltd. Bei allen Besuchen und Besichtigungen durch leitende Mitar­\n\nbeiter des Volkswagen Konzerns,  des Konzernbetriebsrates und eines Kon­\n\nzernvorstands,  zuletzt im Februar 2023,  hat es weder Hinweise auf Zwangsar­\n\nbeit noch andere Menschenrechtsverletzungen im Werk  Urumqi gegeben. An­\n\ndernfalls,  und auch das haben wir immer wieder betont,  hätten wir unmittelbar \n\nund unverzüglich reagiert. \n\nInsbesondere in unserem Gespräch mit dem Weltkongress der Uiguren e.V. \n\nund der Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker am 27.  März 2023 in Berlin haben \n\nwir unterstrichen, dass und wie der Volkswagen Konzern überall auf der Welt \n\nentschieden gegen Zwangsarbeit in Zusammenhang mit seinen geschäftli­\n\nchen Aktivitäten eintritt. Als global tätiges Unternehmen stehen wir für individu­\n\nelle Freiheit,  faire Arbeitsbedingungen,  offenen Welthandel,  wirtschaftliche \n\nEntwicklung und friedliches Zusammenleben.  Bei unseren weltweiten Ge­\n\nschäftsaktivitäten achten wir darauf,  dass unsere Werte gelebt und unsere \n\nStandrads eingehalten werden.

As investor in the Project,  TENBS  is particularly mindful of all stakeholders’ \nhuman rights and promotes the respect of high standards in their NBS activities.  \n\nTENBS is using its influence vis à vis CIMA to continuously improve the transparency of the Project, the \nlevel  of  stakeholders’  engagement  and  the  fair  value  sharing  to  reach  a  positive  outcome  for \nindigenous people and local communities involved in the Project, in alignment with the UN Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights and the ERPA contract. \n\nSharing the value \n\nTENBS’ ambition, with respect to sharing the value from nature-based climate action projects, is to \ninvest in projects where carbon proceeds can directly and/or indirectly finance improvements of local \ncommunities’  livelihood.    Such  investments  fight  against  the  very  roots  of  deforestation  and \ndegradation.  TENBS  also  uses  its  influence  within  NBS  projects  to  promote  fair  redistribution \nmechanisms.   \n\nThe breakdown of carbon proceeds among stakeholders is project-specific and can be direct and/or \nindirect and is sometimes determined by the regulatory environment in the country where the project \nis located. \n\nIn  the  specific  case  of  the  Cordillera  Azul  REDD+  project,  TENBS  decided  to  invest  in  a  sustainable \nfinancial  mechanism  created  and  overseen  by  Peruvian  authorities.  This  mechanism  will  fund  the \noperational budget of the CANP and other National Protected Areas over the long term: it will secure \nthe financing of the conservation operations for future decades and will have a positive impact on the \nlocal communities beyond the generation of carbon credits.  \n\nOn community benefits, in their latest communication to credit buyers (including TENBS) dated 2022, \nCIMA informed TENBS that:  \n\n“So  far,  the  Cordillera  Azul  REDD+  project  has  (…)  helped  to  finance  the  protection  of  1.3  million \nhectares of threatened forest, supporting 28 sustainable enterprises and the construction of a cocoa \npost-harvesting  facility,  creating  688  jobs  -  of  which  39%  are  held  by  women  -  and  supporting  the \ndevelopment  of  35  “Quality  of  Life  Plans”  with  communities,  improving  access  to  fresh  water, \nsanitation and better schools for 5,000 people.” \n\n1 \n\n \n \n\fVersion 22.07.2023 \n\nLand \n\nThe CANP was established in 2001 and is regulated by the competent national authorities (SERNANP \nas regulatory body of the Natural Protected Areas, attached to the Ministry of the Environment). As \nmentioned  in the  Kichwa  Federations’  letter  dated  June  14th,  2023,  allegations  related to  potential \nviolations of the Kichwas’ land rights have been submitted to the United Nations Committee on the \nElimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) which has the mandate to request information and make \nrecommendations to State members.  \n\nTENBS acknowledges the important role that indigenous people’s knowledge plays in the preservation \nof natural resources/biodiversity globally, and particularly in NBS projects, and how important it is to \nrespect their rights. Likewise, we recognize that CIMA has contributed significantly to the biodiversity \nconservation in the CANP in Peru.  \n\nProject assessment \n\nIn  addition  to  TENBS  initial  and  ongoing  project  monitoring,  a  dedicated  Environment,  Social  and \nGovernance assessment has been conducted in 2023, to evaluate the implementation of human rights \nin the daily operations of the Project and identify measures to further strengthen project transparency \nand governance, stakeholder engagement and value-sharing.   \n\nWhilst doing this exercise, due to the legal actions initiated by the Kichwas in Peru against the national \nauthorities, the engagement with potentially affected stakeholders has been limited to date.  \n\nMonitoring and certification \n\nRecently,  as  part  of  the  VERRA  Verified  Carbon  Standard  (VCS)  and  Climate,  Community  and \nBiodiversity (CCB) standard  verification process  regarding the  VCUs under the ERPA,  the validation \nand verification body has confirmed that “Community stakeholders from identified community groups \nsupported  the  assertions  of  positive  impacts  from  the  project  on  the  key  focal  issues.  Community \nmembers interviewed during the site visit agreed the project strongly supported the communities, and \ninterviewees endorsed the continuation of the project. The verification team concluded that based on \nreview of the documentation provided and results of on-site visits and interviews, the net impact of \nproject activities on all community groups is positive.” (VCS-CCB Verification Report, dated November \n1,  2022).  About  70  interviews  were  carried  out  during  that  verification  process,  including  CIMA’s \nmanagement, field technicians, community members, municipal agents, president of women’ group \nand various community associations (craftmen, tourist and cacao association). \n\nConclusion  \n\nTENBS would also like to remind that the Project was one of the early REDD+ initiatives deployed in \nthe Peruvian Amazon since 2008.  As such, it pioneered the sector and paved the way for other project \ndevelopers fighting against deforestation in the area and for community livelihood improvements. As \nfor development projects in general, it requires regular reviews and continuous improvement efforts \nin a fast-changing world where investors and civil society’s standards and expectations are more and \nmore stringent.  \n\nTENBS  remains  open  and  attached  to  multilateral  dialogue  with  CIMA,  the  SERNANP  and  external \nstakeholders  to  present  the  sustainable  financial  mechanism  in  place  and  discuss  further  the  co-\nbenefits to impacted local communities, including indigenous people.  \n\nTotalEnergies Sustainability&Climate team \n\n2"}

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify some misunderstandings contained in \nthe letter. \n\nPTVI has pursued sustainable nickel mining and processing excellence since its establishment \nin 1968 and remains committed to ethical practices and ESG principles. The Company praises \nitself for operating under high environmental and social standards and prioritizing the safety of \npeople and the environment, acting with respect, care, and integrity for its employees, \ncontractors, and community members.  \n\nVale and PTVI remain open to listening to and to understand the concerns and opinions of our \nstakeholders. We take these opportunities seriously and are happy to inform that there is an \nopen dialogue in progress seeking to clarify and address the issues with the communities that \nraised the socioenvironmental concerns related to PTVI. The Company is  also engaging with \nthe local NGO (Walhi) as well. Vale therefore welcomes the opportunity to provide the \nfollowing clarification. \n\nOn the social front, PTVI´s interactions with local communities are rooted in dialogue and \nmutual agreement, ensuring just compensation in line with international guidelines and legal \nstandards. Within the PTVI concession area, unlawful settlement/encroachment has existed \nfor several years, and the Company has engaged relevant government authorities and \nstakeholders regarding the issue. PTVI appreciates that local communities have established \nlivelihoods, though unlawfully, within certain mining areas and engages in productive dialogue \nwith these individuals/communities and stakeholders in an effort to find a reasonable \nresolution, despite such activity being considered unlawful.  \n\nIn conducting land acquisition and/or livelihood compensation, PTVI complies with prevailing \nlaws and the standards and restoration calculations are mutually agreed upon with the \ncommunity involving the local government. All activities related to resettlement and \ncompensation follow internationally recognized practice guidelines. The farmers, for example, \nmentioned in the letter, who were subjected to involuntary removal, were duly compensated.  \n\nPTVI also maintains an accessible grievance mechanism for the community to raise complaints \nor concerns and carries out a formal process for treating demands and complaints from \ninterested parties. \n\nPage 1 of 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fRespecting Human Rights is of paramount importance to PTVI. We place a high value on \nupholding these principles throughout our operations. Our Code of Conduct (CoC) and Human \nRights Policy are aligned with international standards, including the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Voluntary \nPrinciples on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR). We ensure all security teams undergo \ntraining on Human Rights so they may carry out their duties in accordance with the VPSHR and \nthe UNGPs and with due regard for the proportional use of force. \n\nOur Company´s approach to conflict resolution centers on fostering open dialogue with \ncommunities, local authorities, and other interested parties as a means to resolve conflict. \nPTVI is unwavering in its commitment to providing a safe and healthy workplace to its \nemployees, contractors, and suppliers. Any reports of threats or harassment are treated \nseriously and reported to the relevant authorities in compliance with Indonesian laws and \nregulations.  \n\nRegarding the recent events mentioned in the letter, near the Asuli and Lembo South area in \n2023, it is essential to clarify the circumstances. In February 2023, a spontaneous protest took \nplace within the Asuli village community due to PTVI's plans to initiate mining operations. PTVI \nengaged in dialogues with the Asuli village community, and these discussions included the \nactive participation of local government officials. The primary objective of these dialogues was \nto reach mutually agreeable terms regarding livelihood programs for the community. There \nwere no interventions by local authorities at this demonstration. \n\nIn a subsequent demonstration mentioned in the letter, the situation escalated, leading to \nproperty damage involving PTVI assets. To prevent any further escalation and to ensure the \nsafety and security of all individuals involved, PTVI informed local authorities. In this specific \nincident, when demonstrators vandalized a bus owned by PTVI, the police intervened with the \naim of maintaining safety and security for all parties present. PTVI maintains a positive and \nconstructive relationship with all stakeholders, which includes the military and police. \nAdditionally, it should be noted that the armed forces have publicly affirmed that their \nactivities were routine in nature and that they are not involved in PTVI's exploration work. \n\nOn the environmental front, historically, the local community of Asuli village had limited access \nto water sources and depended on water storage ponds for water supply. Before PTVI started \nmining activities, it carried out a comprehensive hydrological analysis to minimize potential \nimpacts on existing water sources and storage ponds. This analysis revealed that pre-existing \nwater storage ponds already had brown and muddy issues, with limited water volume, \nconfirming that poor spring water quality existed before mining operations arrived in the area. \n\nDespite the limited extent of mining operations in the Lembo South block and the absence of \nany negative impact on local communities' water storage ponds, PTVI has taken proactive \nsteps in constructing several water tank facilities to meet the needs of neighboring \ncommunities, especially Asuli village. \n\nIn Sorowako, PTVI efficiently manages over 120 wastewater treatment facilities spanning over \n250 hectares to ensure water disposal is in line with required standards. Rigorous testing and \nsampling of effluents are carried out daily. To underscore its commitment, the Company keeps \nrecords of water quality collaborating with accredited (for the collection and processing of \nwastewater) independent laboratories, together with regular government oversight and \nassessments.  \n\nPage 2 of 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\fIn Sorowako, including the Asuli village, PTVI implemented the provision of water tanks to \nfacilitate access to clean and safe water, strengthening the water supply infrastructure of local \ncommunities. Hydrological analysis is carried out and highlights that the mining activity does \nnot impact the water supply. Involvement with communities, together with collaboration with \nlocal authorities, is registered. \n\nSince July 2023, the Asuli community has taken control of a self-managed water system \ninitiated and supplied by PTVI. Through active participation, the community maintains the \noperation and maintenance of this system, ensuring the sustainable availability of clean water. \n\nPTVI also addresses issues related to hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) in its operations. The 2022 \nPTVI Sustainability Report highlights monitoring and sampling efforts, consistently \ndemonstrating that Cr6+ levels in effluents remain below permitted limits. \n\nFollowing  the  notice,  in  October  2023,  Vale  Base  Metals  (VBM)  established  a  task  force  to \nsupport  PTVI  in  assessing  and  strengthening  their  approach  to  social,  human  rights,  and \nenvironmental impact management in the region.  An investigation was commissioned and VBM \nis carefully reviewing  the  findings to  align  next steps to be  implemented  by PTVI and  will be \nmonitored through the agreed governance procedures.  \n\nVale and PTVI reinforce that we remain available to clarify the points that are laid herein with \nFriends of the Earth (FoE) Japan and Indonesian Environmental Forum (WALHI) South Sulawesi, \nstakeholders, and rightsholders. We also welcome interested parties to access the Statement \non PT Vale Indonesia Tbk published on the Controversies page of Vale´s ESG Portal. \n\nSincerely, \n\nVale, SA. \n\nPage 3 of 3"}

More information can be found in the article linked \nbelow: “Solar Energy Project Leaves Uzbek Women in the Dark”, August 03, 2022, Nina Lesikhina: \nhttps://thediplomat.com/2022/08/solar-energy-project-leaves-uzbek-women-in-the-dark/ . \n\nFurther to your request, please find below (i) a summary of the project and (ii) our answers to your \nquestions.  \n\nIn August 2019, agreements between the Government of Uzbekistan and Total Eren SA was \nestablished  and  signed  for  the  construction  of 100 MW  solar  PV  solar  plant  in  Samarqand \nprovince,  Nurabad  district  and  the  purchase  of  the  associated  generated  electricity \n(hereinafter “Tutly Project”). Tutly Project entered into operation in June 2022 and produces \n270 GWh per year, enough to supply the needs of about 140,000 people in Uzbekistan while \nreducing CO2 emissions. On July 24th, 2023 TotalEnergies acquired Total Eren, increasing its \nstake from close to 30% to 100%, through two concomitant acquisitions (i) acquisition of New \nEren’s participation in Total Eren Holding and (ii) drag of minority shareholders participation \nin Total Eren. \n\nMore specifically, we would like to raise the following questions with TotalEnergies:  \n\n1.  Your Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) mentions ‘The Local population is very interested \nby the opportunity of employment, and as such the CLO shall ensure that a list disclosing the \npositions to be covered during the lifespan of the project and skills required is appropriately \npublicized, so that the local population may have the time and opportunity to train in the \nright areas so as to gain employment as a result of the Project.’ – Can you share details when \nthis was published, and how was this information distributed among the local stakeholders \n– and, whether it was translated in Uzbek?  \n\nGeneral information about the Tutly Project and the list of positions was communicated to \nthe local head of village who shared with local communities during the whole development of \nthe project. For instance, six  public meetings  about Tutly Project were  conducted  in 2019-\n2020 during which the list of positions were shared orally with the community. Project was \ncommissioned in 2022, involving local people in the construction and operation. A Community \nLiaison Officer (CLO) was appointed within the project company employees. \n\nAn “Awareness Raising Program” for local community was also conducted by FE Tutly Solar \nLLC and its consultant Nazar Business & Technology (NBT) in April 2023 (see pictures below). \nThe program was directed towards informing the children in school, shepherds, and the local \npopulation of the village of Tutly about the Tutly Solar PV station and its environmental and \nsocial activities. One of the topics of the program was future professions in energy sector and \ngender component – opportunities to work in energy sector and possibilities for local girls and \nwomen with education to receive profession in energy sector.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPictures of public consultation and awareness raising program session. \n\n2.  Can  you  share  the  exact  list  of  (anonymised)  local  employees  (in  the  Tutly  settlement) \n\ndisaggregated by gender?  \n\nLocal men and women were employed during  lifecycle of the Tutly Project, please find below \nthe figures: \n\nDevelopment \nperiod \nConstruction \nperiod \nOperation \nperiod \n\nMan \n8 \n\n460 \n\n36 \n\nWomen \n4 \n\n20 \n\n7 \n\n3.  Your SEP does not give any details on how women were specifically consulted and engaged \nduring the consultation phase, as mentioned in the article. Could you share any details on \nspecific measures taken to mitigate risks to local women and protect women's rights in the \nnearby settlement? How did you assess and mitigate retaliation risks?  \n\nTotalEnergies  and  its  affiliates  respect  the  rights  of  local  communities  by  identifying, \npreventing and mitigating the impact on their environment and way of life and remedying the \nsituation as needed. We establish dialogue as early as possible to foster lasting relationships \n\n \n \n \n \n\fwith those communities, and we are mindful of opportunities for community development. \nWe  design  and  implement  grievance  procedures  and  corrective  measures,  particularly  on \nbehalf of vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples.  \n\nRegarding the  Tutly Project, multi-dimension consultation activities  were  adopted to make \nmarginalized, voiceless youth and women to gain information about the project. The teams \nmanaged  to  collect  information  about  community  concerns  regarding  the  project  during \nvarious implementation phases.  \n\nWomen were informed about grievance mechanism procedure and grievance mailboxes were \ninstalled  (two  in  Tutly  village  and  one  on  site)  which  are  checked  continually  (see  picture \nbelow). During these meetings, representatives of women’s committee of Tutly village were \nalso encouraged to explain grievances mechanism to all women. \n\nIn  addition,  during  construction  phase  by  the  Engineering,  Procurement  and  Construction \ncontractor (EPC contractor), trainings were given to all employees on the rules of working at \nthe site. One of the main points of which was compliance with human rights requirements, \nincluding gender and racial equality. \n\nPicture 1: Grievance box \n\nPicture 2: Woman signing the list of participants of public meeting. \n\n4.  Access to electricity is a major issue in the community – what actions did Total Eren take, or \nis taking, to improve local energy access (for the residents of the nearby settlement)? –  \n\nThe purpose of the Tutly Project is to generate electricity from the solar farm and sell it to the \npublic power utility (National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan). Electricity supply to end-users \nis the sole responsibility and monopoly of the public distribution utilities. The FE Tutly Solar \nLLC does not have the mandate to supply electricity directly to end-users.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fNevertheless, solar kiosks configured to support lighting, phone charging, TV, refrigeration, \nWi-Fi etc. are under study by FE Tutly Solar LLC in the frame of the Community Development \nplan. \n\n5.  Could you share details on status of actions decided under the Community Development Plan \n\nand their overall costs?  \n\nFE Tutly Solar LLC engaged with the local communities to identify the most relevant Corporate \nSocial Responsibility actions that could be undertaken. After evaluating various options, it was \ncollectively decided during meeting on August 18th, 2022 notably with Tutly village authorities, \nthat the re-construction of the school roof was the most relevant action. In August 2022, FE \nTutly Solar LLC, together with Metka LLC invested 50K€ to repair the roof of the local school \nin Tutly village (see pictures below).  \n\nPictures of the re-construction of the school roof \n\nSubject to prior approval from the local authorities, FE Tutly Solar LLC will invest in the project \nof  install  photovoltaic  system  with  9.6  kWh  storage  and  10  kW  inverters  on  Tutly  medical \ncenter. This project will generate more stable electricity for the medical center and enable \nbetter medical treatment for local communities. \n\n***"}

Given the exceptional nature \nof  the  situation,  Mozambique  LNG  evacuated  a  large  number  of  civilians  and  provided \nemergency aid, medical care, and human and material resources to the civilians sheltering in \nthe entrance to the site. \n\nAs soon as the attacks had started and the situation had been assessed, Mozambique LNG \nlent its assistance to the Mozambican authorities, namely by supplying fuel for the evacuation \nand rescue operations.  \n\nThe runway at the Afungi site was used by the authorities of Mozambique and international \norganizations operating in the area to evacuate people by air. \n\nMozambique LNG employees distributed food and water to civilians sheltering at the entrance \nto the Afungi site.  \n\nThe  Mozambique  LNG  medical  teams  were  mobilized  to  provide  emergency  medical \nassistance to injured civilians who were evacuated by air and sea from the Afungi site. The \nsite’s hospital was also made available. Mozambique LNG also evacuated more than 2,500 \npeople, including many civilians by air and sea, especially by chartering a ferry for this purpose. \nThe resources mobilized to deal with the situation were quite exceptional for a company.   \n\nRegarding the blame made against TotalEnergies for having refused to supply fuel to the South \nAfrican private security company DAG, this company was contracted in 2020 by the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fgovernment of Mozambique to carry out offensive, military security missions against terrorist \ngroups  in  northern  Mozambique.  Security  at  the  Afungi  site  was  provided  by  government \nsecurity  forces.  During  2020,  several  NGOs  reported  serious  crimes  against  local  people \nsupposedly perpetrated by DAG. For these reasons, Mozambique LNG decided that it would \nnot support the offensive military operations carried out by DAG but has provided its assistance \nin rescue operations carried out under the authority of the government security forces.  \n\nConcerning the care of Mozambique LNG staff, contractors and subcontractors during \nthe attacks \n\nThe  evacuation  plan  implemented  in  March  2021  in  the  aftermath  of  the  attack  on  Palma \ninvolved  all  personnel  working  on  the  Afungi  site,  including  those  of  Mozambique  LNG’s \ncontractors and their subcontractors.  \n\nIt  should  be  noted  that,  following  the  intensification  of  the  terrorist  threat,  the  number  of \nemployees  of  Mozambique  LNG,  its  contractors  and  their  subcontractors  was  significantly \nreduced  in  early  2021.  The  remaining  mobilized  personnel  of  Mozambique  LNG,  the \ncontractors  and  their  subcontractors  were  accommodated  on  the  Afungi  site  and  were \ninstructed to remain inside the site at all times for security reasons. \n\nAccording to the information available to Mozambique LNG, these instructions were passed \non  by  Mozambique  LNG’s  contractors  to  their  employees  and  subcontractors,  and  no \ncontractor has informed Mozambique LNG of the presence of employees outside the Afungi \nsite. During the attack on Palma, Mozambique LNG ensured the evacuation of all its personnel \nand subcontractors’ personnel from the Afungi site, as well as a large number of civilians. \n\nIn total, more than 2,500 people, half of whom were personnel of Mozambique LNG and of its \ncontractors and half civilians fleeing the combat zone, were evacuated from the Afungi site by \nsea using a ferry mobilized by Mozambique LNG and by air (plane and helicopter). \n\nDevelopment of the situation following the March 2021 terrorist attacks \n\nGiven the deteriorated security situation in the region, Mozambique LNG decided to withdraw \nall  personnel  from  the  Mozambique  LNG  project  at  the  Afungi  site.  The  situation  led \nMozambique LNG to declare force majeure in April 2021. \n\nThe government of Mozambique is responsible for restoring security: that is the prerogative of \na sovereign state. Thanks to the efforts of the Mozambican government, with the support of \nthe South African Development Community and Rwanda, the security situation has improved \nsignificantly in Cabo Delgado since 2021, and terrorist activities have decreased substantially. \n\nMozambique LNG monitors the security situation on an ongoing basis with the assistance of \ninternal  and  external  experts.  Several  audits  have  been  conducted  and have confirmed the \nsignificant improvement in the security situation in the Cabo Delgado region.  \n\nThe decision to restart the project depends on the ability to complete the project under good \nsecurity  conditions.  This  position  is  shared  by  all  of  Mozambique  LNG’s  partners.  Current \nactivities  on  site  are  limited  to  strengthening  security  infrastructure  and  improving  access \nroads.  \n\nIn addition, Mozambique LNG is implementing a major program of socio-economic initiatives \nfor the local community to promote local economic development, contribute to the stabilization \nof the area, and support local communities. This socio-economic program for Cabo Delgado \nis  part  of  the  Pamoja  Tunaweza  initiative.  This  program  followed  on  from  the  emergency \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fhumanitarian aid that was quickly deployed by Mozambique LNG after the attacks on Palma, \nparticularly the supply of food. \n\n*** \n\nAbout TotalEnergies \nTotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, \nnatural  gas  and  green  gases,  renewables  and  electricity.

If there is clear evidence of a direct linkage between an act, which has caused a \nhuman rights impact or environmental harm, involving a manufacturing partner, or materials being \nsupplied to adidas, we will seek to support a remedy. Where such specificity is lacking, we will still look \nfor ways in which we can encourage preventive measures, or improvements in our own sourcing \npractices.   \n\nA member of the Leather Working Group (LWG) since 2006, adidas has defined standards for our leather \nsuppliers including LWG certification, compliance with our restricted substances list A-01, as well as the \nexclusion of hides from India and China and the exclusion of any exotic leathers or furs.  \n\nCurrently, more than 99% of our leather volume is audited in accordance with the Leather Working Group \nprotocol, and most of our hides are sourced from tanneries with the highest LWG rating (LWG Gold). We \nbelieve the existing LWG audit protocol and chain of custody initiatives provide a strong foundation on \nwhich to create a robust and scalable traceability solution for leather.  \n\nLWG is working together with other organizations on enhancing the audit protocol to include more \ninformation in the due diligence scope, specifically on deforestation, and as next step aims to create a \ntraceability mechanism and chain of custody standard for leather. This will allow higher transparency on \nimportant environmental impacts such as deforestation from the origin of the material, as well as the \nability to assess any related human rights impacts along the upstream supply chain. \n\nWith around 2 percent share in our materials portfolio, leather is one of the least used materials and \nanimal hides are a by-product of the supply of meat, which is the primary driver for cattle farming1. Our \nmain source of hides is the USA, whereas the amount of Brazilian sourced hides in adidas-linked leather \nproduction is rather small.2  Given our limited leverage in the upstream supply chain, we are convinced \n\n1 Typically, hides which are a by-product of slaughtering animals for meat account for about 5% of the revenue \ngenerated from the cattle at slaughter. \n2 We estimate that in 2022 animal hides sourced from Brazil for adidas-linked leather production represented less \nthan 0.006 percent (by m2) of that country’s global exports of skins and hides. \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fthat we have a greater impact to prevent deforestation, and associated human rights issues, in \ncollaboration with partners by setting cross-industry standards and by supporting multistakeholder-\nendorsed accountability frameworks and certification programs, the most prominent of which have been \nthe Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather developed by Textile Exchange, LWG and the World Wide \nFund for Nature (WWF)3 and the UNECE Blockchain Pilot for Sustainable Value Chains (leather case).4  \n\nWe are also supporting a cattle traceability pilot project, Certification of Origin and Traceability Implementation \nInitiative (COTI), which has recently launched in Brazil, to ensure the monitoring of cattle from birth to \nslaughter.5 \n\nWe recognize the need for greater engagement with stakeholders across all tiers in the leather supply \nchain, and the important role that the major meat processing businesses can play in identifying, \nmitigating and preventing adverse environmental and human rights impacts, through their own buying \npractices, and through the active protection and preservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity in \nareas impacted by cattle farming. In this respect, we have seen the creation of new multistakeholder \ninitiatives, such as the Tropical Forest Alliance, which are partnering with industry and using collective \naction to drive a transition to deforestation-free supply chains.6  \n\nWe trust this answers your question. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President, Global  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \n\n3 See https://textileexchange.org/leather-call-to-action/  \n4 See ECE/TRADE/C/CEFACT/2022/9 (unece.org) \n5 See https://www.cotiinitiative.org/  \n6 See https://www.tropicalforestalliance.org/en/about-tfa/about/  \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

By respecting \nand advancing them in our value chain, we are building a foundation that \ncontributes to a resilient future for our planet and its people.\n\nThe start of  \na journey\n\nPeople and respect for human rights \nare at the core of Nestlé’s culture \nand values. We are committed \nto raising awareness, promoting \nbest practices and empowering \npeople across our value chain, \nwhich includes our own operations \nand supply chains. We were early \nadopters of frameworks like the \nUnited Nations Guiding Principles \non Business and Human Rights \n(UNGPs) and the Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) Guidelines \nfor Multinational Enterprises. At \nthe same time, we piloted many \nprograms to assess and address \nrisks on the ground. \n\nSince we began our human rights \njourney, the landscape Nestlé* \nworks in has evolved. There is now \ngreater transparency – and greater \nawareness – of human rights \nrisks. More companies have taken \naction and developed their own \nhuman rights programs. Another \nwelcome development has been the \nemergence of new legislation that \ncan help bring all companies behind \nthe efforts that are necessary to \nprotect people at risk. \n\nAdapting \nto change\n\nIn 2021, Nestlé announced its \nambition to advance a regenerative \nfood system at scale, which is \nfocused on transforming farming \npractices at the heart of the food \nsystem while enabling a just \nand equitable transition. Our \ncommitment to respecting and \npromoting human rights is a key \npart of enabling this move to  \na fairer food system. \n\nA regenerative food system is one \nthat puts people at the center. It is a \nfood system that provides resilient \nand fair livelihoods and dignified \nwork that enables people across the \nworld to support themselves and \ntheir families. \n\nWe will use our scale, experience \nand resources to contribute to that \nfuture. Guided by our roadmap, we \nwill enhance our due diligence by \ndeveloping action plans designed to \nspecifically address the most salient \nissues we face and foster powerful \ncollaborations on the ground. With \nstrong governance, forward-looking \nadvocacy and leading transparency, \nwe want to be leaders in our industry.  \nOur work in this area will further \nstrengthen our contribution to \nthe Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs).\n\nAs the world’s largest food and \nbeverage company, Nestlé is in \nmillions of homes around the world. \nWhat we do matters. We have the \nsize, scale and reach to inspire others \nand help drive collective action. \n\nThis is our roadmap for our \njourney ahead.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP\fFOREWORD\n\nPeople at the \nheart of our \nregeneration \npromise\n\n“ To feed the world \nfor generations \nto come, our \napproach must go \nbeyond ‘doing no \nharm’ to having \na positive impact \non food systems \nat scale.”\n\nU. Mark Schneider\nChief Executive Officer\n\nPaul Bulcke\nChairman\n\nINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n04\n\nThe rise in inequality has become significant for \nsocieties around the world. This is now further \namplified by the impact of climate change. \n\nStakeholders of all kinds are looking  \nto businesses to demonstrate how they are \noffering dignified, safe work that respects and \nadvances human rights while also reducing their \ncontribution to global emissions.\n\nAt Nestlé, we are striving to support and accelerate \nthe transition to a regenerative food system – \none that aims to help protect and restore the \nenvironment, improve the livelihoods of farmers and \nenhance the well-being of farming communities.  \n\nWe want this transition to be just and equitable. \nTherefore, it is vital that we support farmers \naround the world with scientific and technical \nassistance to adopt regenerative agriculture \npractices. We want to reward farmers for their \nquality ingredients, but also for their positive \nimpact on the environment and on communities. \n\nTo feed the world for generations to come, our \napproach must go beyond ‘doing no harm’ to \nhaving a positive impact on food systems at scale. \n\nWe have already launched Nestlé’s Net Zero \nRoadmap in which we said that people would be at \nthe heart of our climate actions. Now, to support \nthe people behind our regeneration promise and \nstrengthen the foundation for a just transition, we \nare launching our Human Rights Roadmap, which \nsets out how Nestlé intends to tackle its most \nsalient human rights risks by putting people at the \ncenter of what we do.\n\nRespecting and promoting human rights is not \nnew for us. We have already trained almost all of \nour employees on human rights and advocated for \nhigher global and regional due diligence standards. \nBeyond our own operations, we have implemented \ninnovative due diligence systems, like the Child \nLabor Monitoring and Remediation System in our \ncocoa supply chain that has set new standards for \nthe industry. \n\nOur experience has shown that respecting and \nadvancing human rights is an ongoing task. The \nprogress we have made and the challenges  \nwe are still facing have helped us rethink our \napproach. Building on the knowledge we have \ngathered and the strengths of the programs \nwe have implemented, our new Human Rights \nFramework aims to enhance our positive impact  \non the ground.\n\nWe have put due diligence at the heart of our new \napproach. This begins with creating detailed action \nplans for every single one of our 10 salient human \nrights issues, supported by five enablers that \nwill further enhance our due diligence and help \nus scale positive impact and track our progress. \nThese include governance and incentives, \npolicies and control systems, engagement and \nadvocacy, strategic partnerships, and transparency \nand reporting.\n\nThis is the roadmap for how we will continue to \nprotect and empower the people across our value \nchain. But it is a map without borders, because \nwe will keep working, learning and adapting to \nadvance human rights across our business.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP\fINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n05\n\n  A proud history \nof embedding \n   human rights\n\nNestlé has been working to incorporate human rights in all aspects of our business for \nmany years. Today, human rights elements have been mainstreamed into 22 Nestlé \npolicies. Since 2011, over 282 000 Nestlé employees have been trained and human rights \nare now embedded across our company’s governance structures. \n\nMainstreaming  \nhuman rights\n\nAssessing human \nrights risks\n\nToday, all of our corporate employees receive \ntraining on human rights as part of their induction \nprogram – 282 532 people to date. We have also \nmainstreamed human rights into 22 policies \nand procedures across our global business. This \ntranslates tangible requirements into relevant \ndocuments such as our Responsible Sourcing \nStandard and Employee Relations Policy, making \nhuman rights a topic all our employees can \nunderstand and speak about. This is all the more \nimportant for a global company like us, operating \nin most countries around the world.\n\nOur human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), \nwhich we started in 2009, have been instrumental \nin helping us understand the environment we work \nin. These robust explorations into the on-the-ground \nreality of our operations and supply chains helped \nNestlé to develop targeted, effective procedures \nand programs that contributed to positive impacts \nfor people and communities on the ground. These \nassessments have also been instrumental in further \nimproving our level of due diligence at the corporate \nlevel by highlighting where our policies and control \nsystems could be strengthened.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP\fDue diligence – which is so core to \nrespecting and advancing human rights – \ncan’t be performed from a desk.\n\nINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n06\n\n“You need teams to be on the ground and \n\nengaging with factory workers, farmers and \nlocal communities among other rights holders \nto understand exactly what impacts you – as a \ncompany – can have on these people, and how to \naddress them. \n\nThat’s why we have placed great value on learning \nby doing. We have tried many innovative approaches \nand initiatives across a number of geographies. \nBased on successes and challenges, we have taken \nsomething from each of them to help us better \nunderstand the landscape we operate in and further \nenhance our human rights performance.\n\nI am proud of the work we have accomplished as \nwe have worked to integrate human rights due \ndiligence processes into our corporate policies \nand procedures, the partnerships we have built \nand the innovative approaches we have piloted \nto address risks on the ground. Now, in this next \nphase of our journey, I am excited to engage \nmore closely than ever with colleagues, peers, \ncivil society, NGOs, governments and others \nto build the partnerships, programs and action \nplans we need to further improve livelihoods and \ntransform lives.”\n\nYann Wyss (on the left), Senior Manager, Social Impact\n\nOur human rights journey started a long time ago\n\nHere is what we have achieved since 2008\n 2008\n\n 2009\n\nWe started reporting on \nhuman rights as part of our \nannual Creating Shared \nValue report \n\nThe Danish Institute \nfor Human Rights \n(DIHR) conducted a human \nrights gap analysis of our \npolicies and procedures\n\n 2010\n\n 2011\n\nWe conducted our \nfirst human rights \nimpact assessments \n(HRIAs) together with \nthe DIHR in Colombia \nand Nigeria to fully \nunderstand the type  \nand scope of the  \nhuman rights impacts  \nof our operations in  \nthose countries\n\nWe conducted \nour first corporate \nhuman rights \nrisk assessment \ntogether with \nNestlé’s Group \nRisk team\n\nWe launched our \nHuman Rights Due \nDiligence program \nbased on the newly \nadopted United Nations \nGuiding Principles  \non Business and  \nHuman Rights\n\nThe Fair Labor \nAssociation (FLA) \nconducted its first \nassessment of our \nhazelnut supply chain \nin Turkey \n\nWe started rolling \nout our human \nrights training tool \nto Nestlé employees \nworldwide \n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP \n\fINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n07\n\nWho our \nwork protects\n\nWe are committed to respecting and promoting human rights in our operations and supply chain, taking \naction to protect rights holders and to achieving long-term systemic change.

At the same time, a growing body of legislation \nand the changing expectations of stakeholders mean \nthat there is more interest in our actions.\n\nThe only way to strengthen our human rights \napproach and stay ahead of these demands is \nby carrying out effective due diligence to assess, \naddress and report transparently on actual and \npotential human rights risks. These efforts must  \ncover our own operations and supply chains across  \nall countries where we work. \n\nBy sharpening our focus on due diligence, we can \nstrategically meet our aim of scaling positive impact \nacross incredibly diverse geographies using a clear \nand comprehensive approach.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP\fINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n13\n\nPRIORITY:  \nSALIENT ISSUE ACTION PLANS\n\n    Understanding \nour salient issues \n\nWe are developing action plans for our 10 salient \nissues. These plans, which sit at the heart of our \ndue diligence program, will enable us to act as a \nforce for good. \n\nThe action plans will articulate our strategy for \nassessing, addressing and reporting on each \nsalient issue, defining what we need to do across \nour value chain, as well as what collective action \ncan be taken.\n\nWe aim to harness the strengths and capacities of \neach Nestlé department through clearly defined \nexpectations. With collaboration built into each \naction plan, we hope to spark new engagement \nand inspire collective action with peers, civil \nsociety, NGOs and governments. This way, we can \ntackle the root causes of our salient issues and \ncreate positive impact at scale.\n\nWe will publish all our salient issue action plans by \nthe end of 2022 and report on progress against key \nperformance indicators (KPI) by the end of 2025.\n\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR \nSALIENT ISSUE ACTION PLANS\n\nThese action plans sit on solid \nfoundations: the 13 HRIAs we carried \nout between 2009 and 2017; the \nresults of our strengthened audit and \nmonitoring processes covering both \nour own operations and upstream \nsupply chains; the grievances that \nhave been logged into our Speak Up \nsystem; and the human rights risk \nassessment (HRRA) methodology that \nwe developed over the course of 2020 \nand 2021. \n\nThe HRRA assesses the level of risks \nposed to rights holders across the \ncountries where we operate (either \ndirectly or through our business \nrelationships, in particular, the sourcing \nof raw materials). It is based on publicly \navailable information from Unicef, the \nWorld Bank, the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO), the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and the US \nDepartment of Labor, among others, in \naddition to Verisk Maplecroft indicators. \nWe are planning to use the results of \nthe HRRA as a basis for developing our \nsalient issue action plans.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP\fINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n14\n\nChild labor and access to education\n\nDefining the issue\nChild labor is work that is mentally, \nphysically, socially or morally dangerous \nand harmful to children or interferes with \ntheir education by depriving them of the \nopportunity to attend school – obliging \n\nthem to leave school prematurely or \nrequiring them to attempt to combine \nschool attendance with excessively \nlong hours and heavy work. One of the \nILO’s founding principles is the effective \nabolition of child labor.\n\nWhy it matters\nChildren deserve the chance \nto learn, to grow in a safe \nand healthy environment \nand to be happy. Companies \nlike ours play an important \nrole to address risks and \nimprove access to education, \nespecially in communities \nwhere poverty is widespread \nand resources are scarce.\n\nNestlé’s \n  salient \n issues \n\nOur salient issues are the areas we \nhave identified as those human rights \nat risk of the most severe negative \nimpact on people through our activities \nor business relationships. Pages 14–24 \ndetail how we define and address each \nof the following issues: \n\n    Child labor and access to education \n      Forced labor and \n\nresponsible recruitment  \n\n     Living income and living wage\n      Gender equity, non-discrimination  \n\nand non-harassment\n\n     Safety and health at work\n      Freedom of association and \n\ncollective bargaining\n\n    Right to water and sanitation\n       Indigenous peoples and local \ncommunities’ land rights \n     Data protection and privacy\n      Right to food and access to nutritious, \n\naffordable and adequate diets \n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP\fINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n15\n\nY\nD\nU\nT\nS\nE\nS\nA\nC\n\nPROVIDING \nACCESS TO \nEDUCATION IN \nWEST AFRICA\n\nThrough our Child Labor Monitoring and \nRemediation System (CLMRS), we keep in \ncontact with the families of over 86 000 \nchildren in Côte d’Ivoire through 1640 \ncommunity liaisons – all local people who \nthemselves come from cocoa-growing \ncommunities\n\nWe act as soon as children at risk are \ndetected. For the cases where we can \nintervene, we try to understand the root \ncause and then work with the family \nand/or the community to develop a \ntailored solution. \n\nWe know that there is a clear connection \nbetween better education and lower levels of \nchild labor risk. With our partner the Jacobs \nFoundation, we’ve set up 131 bridging classes \nto help kids who have missed out on schooling \nand need to catch up. These schools deliver \ntwo years’ worth of the national curriculum in \nsmall classes in just nine months.\n\nApproximately\n\n128 000 children\n\nhave been protected against the risk of child \nlabor since 2012, of which more than 40 000 \nhave increased their access to education.\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nWe were the first company in the industry \nto introduce a Child Labor Monitoring and \nRemediation System (CLMRS), which has now \nbecome a leading tool that helps tackle child \nlabor risk by working directly with communities \non the ground. Our CLMRS prioritizes access to \neducation – including building and renovating \nschools and securing birth certificates for \nregistration – and tackling rural poverty \nthrough income diversification programs \nand support.\n\nWe were also the first to openly report child \nlabor risk in our cocoa supply chain when we \npublished our inaugural Tackling Child Labor \nin 2017. We produced a second report in 2019 \nthat showed how our CLMRS has benefited \nthousands of children and their families in  \nCôte d’Ivoire and Ghana.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP \n\fINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n16\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nWe are addressing the risk of forced \nlabor in various agricultural supply \nchains by developing programs \ntargeting forced labor indicators, \nlike unethical recruitment practices. \nFor example, we have supported \nthe development of a human rights-\nbased due diligence tool on ethical \nrecruitment for palm oil supply chains \nthat can be used by suppliers looking \nto responsibly recruit workers. \n\nIn our seafood supply chain in \nThailand, we work with Issara Institute \nto analyze recruitment practices and \nchannels to implement responsible \nrecruitment pathways. Partnering \non the ground with recruitment \nagencies, grassroots organizations \nand government, Issara works to \nensure worker voice and remediation \nof grievances, from recruitment \nthrough employment. Through work \nwith Issara and other partners, Nestlé \nseafood suppliers in Thailand have \nall improved responsible recruitment \npractices for all workers since 2018.\n\nForced labor and responsible recruitment\n\nDefining the issue\nForced labor is any work or service \nthat is exacted from any person under \nthreat of any penalty and for which \nthat person has not offered themself \nvoluntarily. It can manifest itself as abuse \nof vulnerability, deception, restriction \nof movement, isolation, physical and \nsexual violence, intimidation and \nthreats, retention of identity documents, \nwithholding of wages, debt bondage, \nabusive working and living conditions, \nand excessive overtime. \n\nWhy it matters\nMore than 24 million people are \nestimated to be trapped in forced labor \naround the world, mostly in industries \nwith a lot of work and little regulation, \nsuch as agriculture. Nestlé can play \nan important role in helping address \nthis issue – for example, by using our \ninfluence to promote and ensure fair and \nequitable recruitment practices.\n\nY\nD\nU\nT\nS\nE\nS\nA\nC\n\nDRIVING ETHICAL RECRUITMENT \nPRACTICES IN OUR SUPPLY CHAINS\n\nEthical recruitment practices to address \ndeception in recruitment and debt \nbondage are a core focus of our palm oil \nresponsible sourcing work. We funded \nthe development of training modules \nand a performance matrix to support our \nsuppliers with the adoption of a human \nrights-based due diligence tool on ethical \nrecruitment. The performance matrix \nhas been designed to allow our palm oil \nsuppliers to track and measure progress \nspecifically related to improvements in \ntheir recruitment practices. \n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP \n\fLiving income \nand living wage\n\nDefining the issue\nA living wage or living income is the \nbenchmark income level that allows \npeople to enjoy a decent standard \nof living as stated in Article 25 of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights \n(UDHR). This includes safe shelter, \nsufficient food, water and sanitation, \nhealthcare, education, clothing \nand transport. \n\nINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n17\n\nI\n\nL\nA\nN\nO\nM\nI\nT\nS\nE\nT\n\nWhy it matters\nPoverty is one of the \nroot causes of many \nsocial and environmental \nchallenges, from child \nlabor to deforestation. \nWe are using our \nplace as an important \nactor in the food and \nbeverage industry to \nhelp enable and support \nresilient communities \nbuilt on strong and \nsustainable livelihoods.\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nSince 2013, Nestlé has been implementing a Living Wage \nInitiative to ensure that all our direct employees, including \ntemporary ones, earn a living wage. We work with our partner \nBusiness for Social Responsibility (BSR) to help us define \nthe living wage threshold in each country where we operate. \nWe use this information to identify and address cases where \nlegal minimum wages do not fulfill basic needs. These figures \nare updated on a regular basis to ensure that our employees \ncontinue to be paid above the living wage.\n\nIn our supply chain, we have worked to improve the livelihoods \nof smallholder farmers. Through both our Nescafé Plan and \nour Nestlé Cocoa Plan, we have invested in initiatives that are \nhelping farmers improve their yields, access capital to invest \nin their businesses and diversify their incomes. Some of these \ninitiatives focus on supporting farmers with growing their \nbusiness through regenerative agriculture that can protect local \nbiodiversity and halt deforestation, helping to tackle several of \nthe issues posed by rural poverty.\n\n“As a major food and beverage \n\ncompany, we rely on the more \nthan 500 000 farmers and  \n150 000 suppliers we source \nfrom.

Our Gender Balance \nAcceleration Plan aims to increase the \nproportion of women in our top 200 senior \nexecutive positions to 30% by 2022. We \npromote the inclusion of people with \ndisabilities across our global workforce \nthrough our membership of the ILO Global \nBusiness and Disability Network.

Many \nstandards have been adopted by \nthe ILO specifically dealing with \noccupational safety and health. In \naddition, the COVID-19 pandemic \nhas emphasized how important it \nis to ensure and promote a safe \nand healthy working environment.\n\nWhy it matters\nPeople are at the heart of our \nbusiness. Therefore, the safety \nand health of our employees, \nbusiness partners and the \ncommunities where we operate \nis extremely important for us. \nWe believe that taking care \nof people helps to build and \nsustain healthy and motivated \nworkforces that support the \naims of our business to create a \npositive impact on society.\n\nY\nD\nU\nT\nS\nE\nS\nA\nC\n\nEXPLORING MECHANIZATION  \nAS A ROUTE TO WORKER SAFETY\n\nIn Thailand, we partnered with Verité on  \na project to explore how to improve safety  \non Thai fishing vessels. The project focused \non promoting safe working and living \nconditions at sea. This was based on a \ndemonstration vessel funded by Nestlé and \nour supplier Thai Union to showcase how \nworker welfare and business imperatives  \ncan align through mechanization. \n\nImpacts of the mechanization included less \novercrowding on the vessel (due to needing \nsmaller crews) and improved worker safety \nas crew members were no longer extensively \ninvolved in deploying and retrieving nets.\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nWe take action to promote the health and safety of \nour employees and the workers in our supply chains, \nusing solutions that are relevant to the industry and \nlocal context. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, in \naddition to our normal strict hygiene standards, we \nhave put in place additional safety measures in our \nfactories, offices and distribution centers. We have \nalso encouraged our office-based employees to work \nfrom home whenever possible. \n\nBeyond addressing the risks posed by the global \npandemic, we have initiated interventions in various \nsupply chains to help ensure workers have access to \nprotective personal equipment, hygiene services or \nemergency equipment. \n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP \n\fFreedom of \nassociation  \nand collective \nbargaining\n\nDefining the issue\nWorkers and employees have the right to \nfreely and voluntarily establish unions and \njoin one of their choice. In addition, these \norganizations have the right to carry out \ntheir activities in full freedom and without \ninterference. Organizations representing \nworkers and employers can engage in \nopen, transparent and fair negotiations to \ndetermine working conditions and terms of \nemployment, and regulate relations between \nemployers and workers.

We aim to promote \ncontinuous improvements in \nthe working conditions of our \nemployees, giving special attention \nto respecting their rights to \nestablish and join organizations of \ntheir own choosing and engage in \nconstructive negotiations. \n\nRegular dialogue with our employees \nand union representatives creates \nan opportunity to discuss matters \nof mutual concern and allows us to \nengage our employees on our business \nactivities and objectives. \n\nSince 2013, we have held dialogues \nwith the International Union of Food, \nAgricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, \nCatering, Tobacco and Allied Workers’ \nAssociations (IUF) on a biannual \nbasis. This helps us develop areas of \ncommon interest, such as health and \nsafety, working conditions, freedom of \nassociation and collective bargaining.\n\n“Open dialogue, where the voice of \n\nthe employee is heard, and direct \nand frequent communication with \nall employees, both union members \nand non-union members, are key at \nany time. As we continue building \nawareness and developing the \nleadership behaviors to help us build \ntrusted relationships, earlier in 2021 \nwe launched an online introductory \ntraining on Employee Relations. \nIt highlights the importance of \nrespecting human rights and the part \nwe can all play in creating a working \nenvironment where people feel and \nperform at their best.”\n\nBilyana Georgieva-Voeva,  \nGroup Employee Relations and \nEmployee Health Manager\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP\fY\nD\nU\nT\nS\nE\nS\nA\nC\n\nRight to \nwater and \nsanitation\n\nDefining the issue\nAccess to safe, affordable \nand reliable drinking water \nand sanitation services \nare basic human rights. \nThey are indispensable to \nsustaining healthy livelihoods \nand maintaining people’s \ndignity.

We supported people in \nneed through our partnership with the \nInternational Federation of Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the \nKenya Red Cross Society.\n\nA portion of our donation financed the \ninstallation of a solar-powered water \npumping system, as well as water \nstorage and distribution facilities, and \nthe circulation of crucial sanitation and \nhygiene information.\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nIn 2016, we developed our Nestlé Guidelines on Respecting \nthe Human Rights to Water and Sanitation. These rules \nhave since been implemented in all our markets and key \nagricultural supply chains. We have worked with local \nstakeholders and organizations to increase access to WASH. \nTo date, these projects have benefited more than 1.4 million \npeople in the areas surrounding our facilities. As different \ncommunities have unique needs, in 2019 we developed a \nCommunity Relations Process tool for our medium- and \nhigh-risk markets. This mapping tool helps us identify \nkey stakeholders with whom we then engage on tailored \nWASH interventions.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP \n\fINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n22\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nRequirements for land rights and FPIC are included in our \nResponsible Sourcing Standard. We also released a Commitment \non Land & Land Rights in Agricultural Supply Chains in 2014. \nSince then, we have piloted different tools to better assess and \naddress land rights risks in our supply chain, such as Landesa’s \nLandAssess Tool in our sugar supply chain in Nigeria and a forest \nfootprint pilot tool in our palm oil supply chain in Aceh, Indonesia. \n\nThrough our new Forest Positive strategy, Nestlé is focusing \non how to increase direct engagement with local communities \nand leverage our influence to secure land rights for indigenous \npeoples and local communities.\n\nY\nD\nU\nT\nS\nE\nS\nA\nC\n\nEMPOWERING INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO BE STEWARDS \nOF FORESTS AND NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS \n\nIn British Columbia, Canada, Nestlé \nis participating in a program to \naddress risks to forest degradation \nand infringements of the rights \nof indigenous peoples. We are \nsupporting the Tsay Keh Dene Nation \nto gain protection for key areas of \nland against harvesting for pulp \nand paper. The Tsay Keh Dene will \n\nbe leading high conservation value \nassessments across their territory to \nidentify and protect its most unique \nand critical areas. The aim is that \nthese assessments will form the \nfoundation of agreements with local \nindustry players on which areas can \nbe responsibly harvested and which \nmust be preserved.\n\nIndigenous peoples and local \ncommunities’ land rights\n\nDefining the issue\nLand rights impact aspects of \nthe right of self-determination, \nincluding the right to free, prior \nand informed consent (FPIC) of \nindigenous peoples. The right of \nself-determination is particularly \nrelevant to companies that \npursue economic, social and \ncultural development and use \nnatural wealth and resources.\n\nWhy it matters\nIndigenous peoples, local communities \nand Afro-descendant peoples number \napproximately 2.5 billion people globally \nand customarily claim almost half of \nthe world’s lands and forests. Despite \nthis, they have legal rights to less than \n20% of this land, much of which forms \na significant portion of the terrestrial \ncarbon sink. Securing land rights of local \npeoples is critical to eliminating supply \nchain-driven deforestation, the success \nof nature-based solutions and achieving \nmore ambitious corporate environmental \nand social commitments.\n\nNESTLÉ’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ROADMAP \n\fData protection and privacy\n\nDefining the issue\nPeople’s right to a private life is \nenshrined in the UDHR. Data protection \nis about securing data against \nunauthorized access, whereas data \nprivacy is concerned with the collection, \nstorage and use of personal data and \nthe rights of the individual. \n\nWhy it matters\nData has enormous value, especially \nin our digital reality. It can help better \nengage with consumers, conduct \ninnovative research and development \nand deliver valued products. But if \nnot handled with care, it can lead to \ninterference with people’s private lives.\n\nINTRODUCTION    |    OUR HISTORY    |    OUR FR AMEWORK    |   OUR ROADMAP\n\n23\n\nI\n\nL\nA\nN\nO\nM\nI\nT\nS\nE\nT\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nNestlé respects the rights of \nindividuals in relation to their \npersonal data and recognizes \nprivacy as a fundamental \nhuman right. All Nestlé Group \ncompanies comply with Nestlé’s \nPrivacy Program. This is based \non internationally recognized \nprivacy principles, and evolves \nto address regulatory changes. \nWe have over 60 data protection \nchampions worldwide who are \nresponsible for overseeing our \nPrivacy Program. We participate \nin a range of multi-stakeholder \ngroups to keep up to date with \ndata protection developments \nand issues, including in artificial \nintelligence, data ethics and \ne-commerce, and to advocate for \nbetter data privacy and security.\n\n“The rapid adoption and innovation of \n\ndigital during the COVID-19 pandemic \nhas raised more questions about digital \nethics, privacy and cyber security. We \nsee growing negative sentiment toward \ncorporate and government actors when \nit comes to their data collection and \nprocessing initiatives.\n\nData ethics and ethical data management \nis critical in this emerging world of \nthe digital economy. It is about acting \nresponsibly and sustainably with data \nby doing not only what is legal but also \nwhat is right with data.

Approximately  \n840 million people go to bed hungry \nand an estimated 3 billion cannot \nafford a healthy nutritious diet. As \npart of our regenerative journey, we \nwant to play a key role in supporting \nmillions of people so they can \naccess the nutrients they need.\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nWe have been focusing on \nexpanding our range of affordable \nstaples that are fortified with \nimportant micronutrients to  \nhelp address conditions such as \nanemia and wasting, especially  \nin vulnerable populations.

This is one example \nof the kind of advocacy work \nwe are undertaking to support \ngreater due diligence measures \nworldwide.\n\nAs our experience and knowledge of \nthe challenges to human rights has \ngrown, we have seen the power of direct \nengagement with key stakeholders in \nbuilding collective solutions. \n\nHowever, solutions can only create \nlasting change if they are implemented \nagainst a backdrop of effective \nlegislation and oversight. We actively \nsupport appropriate legislation that \nleads companies to greater action, \ncollaboration and transparency. That is \nwhy engagement and advocacy have \nbecome a key feature of our human \nrights work.\n\nWhat we’ve done so far\nWe contribute to shaping industry \nassociations’ positioning on due \ndiligence legislation and have joined \nforces with different stakeholder \ngroups, including civil society, to call  \nfor mandatory due diligence. \n\nIn 2021, we began to train our markets \nto build capacity around advocacy \nand engagement on human rights \ntopics, including the need to engage \nwith governments to help tackle the \nroot causes of human rights issues in \nsourcing countries.\n\nWe also continue to promote the rule \nof law through our support for the \nUnited Nations Global Compact on \nSDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong \nInstitutions.

It is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% by the \nGovernment of Madagascar. QMM currently employs some 2,000 people, 98% of whom are Malagasy. \nSince 2005, QMM has invested over US$1 billion in Madagascar, with US$400 million invested in building \nshared infrastructure through public-private partnerships. \n\nQMM operates in a highly sensitive area from a water and broader environmental perspective. The local \ncommunities are farmers and fisherfolks, and rely on the rivers and lakes surrounding QMM’s operations \nfor their livelihoods. These communities are our neighbours and we take our responsibility to them very \nseriously.  \n\nFor context, we would like to provide more information about the incidents from 2022 and 2023 which are \nreferenced in some of the reports.  \n\nControlled mine water release in 2022 \n\nFollowing  three  cyclones  and  extreme  rain  falls  at  site  in  early  2022,  a  controlled  “exceptional”  water \nrelease was undertaken by QMM, authorised by the Malagasy Regulator, to ensure the integrity of our \ninfrastructure and the safety of our people and communities. \n\nShortly after the release, some community members accused QMM’s water release of being the cause \nof dead fish in the bodies of water surrounding the mine. QMM, together with the Regulator, undertook a \nseries  of  water  sample  analyses,  in  addition  to  ongoing  release  water  monitoring.  These  showed  no \nconclusive link between the activities of the mine and the fish deaths. Despite this, the situation escalated \nand in response a fishing ban was imposed by the Government.  \n\nQMM also commissioned  independent experts,  Water Research Group (WRG), to investigate  the fish \ndeaths. Preliminary findings indicate that the fish deaths are unlikely to have been caused by any of the \nmetals concentrations in fish. The final WRG report will be released publicly in early 2024. \n\n2022 grievance and remedy process \n\nIn addition to short-term measures taken by QMM to respond to the fishing ban, including emergency \nfood  deliveries  to  over  7,000  affected  households,  a  tripartite  process  was  initiated  between  the \nGovernment, QMM and community representatives and led to an agreed community grievance process \nin May 2022.  \n\nA  total  of  8,778  claims  were  considered  in  the  process,  with  5,204  eligible  individuals  receiving \ncompensation from QMM by March 2023. Claimants were organised in three main categories: fisherfolk, \nnatural  resource  users  and  land  claimants.  Compensation  was  agreed  with  claimant  representatives, \nfollowing  a  negotiation  process,  and  based  on  the  cumulative  impact  of  QMM's  operations  for  each \nspecific group deemed  eligible since  operations began. Land claimants were deemed  not  eligible and \nmanaged by a separate process between the land claimants and the authorities. \n\nThe  process  was  voluntary  and  publicised  within  affected  communities  including  on  local  radio. \nNegotiations took place with representatives of fisherfolk and natural resource users, in the presence of \ntwo observers and a jointly appointed mediator. The representatives of the various groups were to keep \nthe communities informed of developments.   \n\nA blockade of the mine access road in December 2022 eventuated when those deemed ineligible through \nthe tripartite process were notified. This incident, which lasted more than two weeks, saw operations at \nQMM curtailed to the provision of essential services only, such as water management and power for the \n\nGeneral Business / Affaires générales \n\n1 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ftown of Fort Dauphin. The move, which was made to ensure the safety of our people, resulted in short-\nterm power outages in Fort Dauphin. The situation led to further negotiation and agreement, with QMM \ncommitting to increase its community investment to US$10 million over three years. This investment has \nsince been superseded and increased to US$4 million per year under the fiscal agreement reached with \nthe Malagasy Government in August 2023.  \n\n2023 LUSUD incidents \n\nIn  June  2023,  protest  led  by  LUSUD  (Lutte  pour  le  Sud),  targeted  QMM’s  operations  and  resulted  in \nnearly 400 of our people being prevented from leaving our site for nearly a week. To ensure the safety of \nour people, Rio Tinto curtailed most activities, leaving only essential services such as the provision of \npower to Fort Dauphin. On 4 July 2023, following the intervention of the national and local authorities to \nrestore order, QMM was able to resume operations.  \n\nThe  LUSUD-led  demonstrations  were  unlawful,  taking  place  despite  a  ban  on  public  gatherings  to \npreserve  national  peace  and  unity  during  the  celebration  of  Independence  Day.  We  understand  the \nGovernment issued arrest warrants against the leaders of LUSUD.  \n\nWe  are  committed  to  working  with  communities  and  their  representatives  in  an  open  and  respectful \nmanner. For example, QMM invited LUSUD to participate in a panel discussion with local  civil society \norganisations (ROHY) on 5 - 6 June 2023 in Fort Dauphin, but they declined our invitation. In early July, \nan association of traditional leaders from the Fort Dauphin area (FTAMAR) invited both LUSUD and QMM \nto participate in a facilitated dialogue following the disruptions, however, LUSUD did not attend.  \n\nIn October 2023, LUSUD organised another protest near QMM’s operations. Our understanding is that \nits principal demand was the cancellation of the arrest warrants issued in respect of their leaders. \n\nDuring  this  protest,  on  20  October  2023,  there  was  an  incident  between  Madagascan  Public  Security \nForces  and  local  demonstrators  near  QMM’s  operations.  In  addition  to  a  roadblock  erected  by  the \ndemonstrators,  Public  Security  Forces  publicly  confirmed  that  two  people  were  taken  hostage  by  the \nprotesters.  Public  Security  Forces  intervened  to  free  the  hostages,  which  led  to  a  violent  altercation, \nfollowing which Public Security Forces have stated that one person died, and another was injured. Our \nthoughts are with those affected by this tragic incident.  \n\nQMM respects people’s right to protest in a safe and lawful way, however, rejects any behaviour or activity \nthat can threaten the safety and welfare of others. QMM has provided support to local authorities and \ntraditional leaders to help find a safe and peaceful long-term solution to concerns, with safety and security \nremaining  our  priority.  We  continue  to  seek  open  and  respectful  dialogue  with  local  communities  and \nother  stakeholders,  and  are  committed  to  building  relationships  based  on  trust,  safety,  and  mutual \nrespect. \n\nWater  \n\nQMM’s operations at Mandena was originally assumed to be water deficient, that is, freshwater would be \nrequired to be  extracted from the surrounding  environment to  assist the mine  processes. Since  2014, \nQMM has not needed any freshwater from the surrounding environment for operational purposes.  \n\nWhile no chemicals are added or used in the mining process, the mining operation does influence the \nquality of the process water. Historically, QMM has operated under a national decree exemption approved \nby the Regulator that allowed the release of water into the receiving environment with a pH between 3.2 \nand  6.  As  of  November  2020,  the  Regulator  required  QMM  to  comply  with  the  national  decree  for  all \nsurface water release, with a pH between 6 and 9. This triggered the need for QMM to install a water \ntreatment plant to comply with the amended decree.  \n\nSince July 2022, QMM has released water through the pilot water treatment plant and polishing pond, \nwith  the  aim  to  meet  the  Regulatory  decree  for  pH  and  aluminium.  After  a  successful  trial,  the  water \ntreatment plant will now be expanded and is expected to be operational in 2024.  \n\nQMM  will  shortly  make  available  the  2021-2023  Water  Report,  which  includes  its  water  management \nstrategy, and monitoring data and performance, on the QMM webpage. \n\nRadiation  \n\nIn 2019, the Andrew Lees Trust (ALT UK – a civil society organisation) commissioned a study, based on \nQMM’s data, which claimed QMM’s activities had caused elevated levels of radiation around Mandena. \nFollowing those allegations, in 2019 QMM commissioned a study to assess that risk with independent \n\nGeneral Business / Affaires générales \n\n2 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n\finternational radiation expert, JBS&G, based in Australia. The three-year study published in September \n2023  shows  that  there  is  no  basis  for  heightened  health  concerns  around  local  radiation  levels.  The \nanalysis  received  on  the  five  cycles  covering  various  seasons  from  November  2019  to  October  2022 \nshows that local food sources, water, air and dust are safe from a radiological perspective.   \n\nCommunity initiatives \n\nQMM recognises that access to safe and clean water is a fundamental human right. We are committed \nto playing our part in  protecting water in and around  our operations and helping communities to  have \naccess  to  potable  water.  We  continue  to  invest  to  help  communities  in  the  municipality  of  Ampasy \nNahampoana, Mandromondromotra, Andrakaraka and Emanaka receive access to potable water. \n\n•  The construction of the Andrakaraka and Emanaka potable water stations was finalised in 2022 \n\nand 2023 respectively. \n\n•  The  construction  of  the  potable  water  stations  for  Mandromondromotra  and  Ampasy \n\nNahampoana will be completed soon. \n\nIn November 2023, the Governor of the Anosy Region officially announced the launch of a major project \nto improve access to potable water for Fort Dauphin and its surrounding areas. QMM, in collaboration \nwith other entities, will contribute to this project, the details of which will be shared soon.  \n\nAs part of the Fiscal agreement with the Government of Madagascar announced in August 2023, QMM \nwill be issuing its first dividend to the Government, with the Government committing to invest an amount \nequal to  this first dividend  (US$12 million) in  the  109km rehabilitation project of the National Road 13 \n(RN13).  Rio  Tinto  will  also  participate  in  this  project  with  up  to  US$8  million  in  additional  funds  to  be \nreleased according to agreed milestones. This project will bring significant improvement to the region by \nfacilitating the movement of people and critical supplies to hard-to-access areas.  \n\nAlso in August 2023, QMM announced a US$2 million donation to UNICEF to support their emergency \nresponse efforts to the famine crisis in Madagascar. This is one of several UNICEF disaster response \nefforts that Rio Tinto has supported over the past 18 months. \n\nWe continue to work to increase transparency, engage in good faith, and build lasting relationships with \nthe local communities, to understand concerns and together, develop long-term solutions. \n\nGeneral Business / Affaires générales \n\n3"}

Kingfisher Project land acquisition  \n\nKingfisher  project  has  acquired  950  acres  affecting  788  PAPs.  All  of  the  affected  PAPs  have  been  fully \ncompensated and the payments currently stand at 100%. 65 PAPs who were physically displaced by the project \nwere provided with resettlement houses (63 resettlement houses and 2 institutional latrines). The project perimeter \nalso does not extend into the lake, and fishing activities have continued alongside CNOOC’s project activities.  \n\nCNOOC also has in place a Grievance Management mechanism, working through the oil and gas committees or \nCommunity Liaison Officers. However, no grievances related to human rights violations against the fisherfolk in the \nKingfisher area have been received.  \n\n2.  UPDF presence and reports of forceful eviction of families from several villages \n\nRegarding the displacement of 13 villages and displacement of 1,200 people, we were able to establish from our \nconsultations and engagements with the community that 6 villages had been disbanded by the government, as \nthey were considered illegal settlements which were not officially gazetted through the local government structures. \n\nFrom consultations with Kikuube district officials, and community consultations, the company established that the \nvillages were considered to be potential hosts of international boundary challenges due to proximity of the affected \nareas with the DRC border.  \n\nThe same position was reiterated by the district security team who emphasized that the disbandment of some of \nthe villages was due to security concerns in the area. For example, we were informed by Kikuube district officials \nthat a military detachment has been present in Kina, one of the villages in the Kingfisher area since 2018. Military \npatrols are being carried out as far as Panyimur in Pakwach District, and as far as Ntoroko District, outside of the \nKingfisher project area.   \n\nWe were also informed that some villages in Kyevunda Kabwoya sub-county in Hoima district had been disbanded \nto protect the fish breeding grounds, long before the commencement of the Kingfisher project operations.  Breeding \npatterns have also been impacted by the rising population on the landing sites, which has prompted people to move \nto the small islands that used to be breeding grounds for the fish, e.g Kiina, Busidi, Kyenyanja and Kamina along \nthe  shoreline.  These  were  not  previously  occupied  by  people  and  the  rising  population  has  impacted  on  the \nbreeding patterns of the fish. The change in the fish breeding patterns were also confirmed during the community \nconsultative session.  \n\nWhile community  members  complained  of  lack  of  sensitisation  before  the  disbandment of  the  settlements,  the \ndistrict  leadership  on  the  other  hand  reported  that  the  impacted  villages  were  engaged  and  sensitized  on  the \nreasons for the disbandment prior to this exercise.   \n\n3.  UPDF enforcement activities among fisherfolk  \n\nThe  enforcement  of  fishing  regulations  is  being  carried  out  countrywide.  We  have  consulted  with  various \nstakeholders on the subject of UPDF enforcement activities among fisherfolk, i.e representatives from the Ministry \nof Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF), and consultative session with fisherfolk.  \n\nMAAIF confirmed that the military enforcement operations on Lake Albert and other water bodies where commercial \nfishing is conducted in Uganda were being implemented under the Fisheries and Aquaculture Act, 2022 which \nestablished a Fisheries Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Unit to oversee and enforce fisheries policies.  \n\nUganda Branch: Plot 21, Yusuf Lule Road, Postal Address: PO Box 34867, Kampala - Uganda \nT.: +256 (0) 312 426000 – Fax: +256 (0) 204 916 999 \n\nTotalEnergies EP Uganda Simplified Joint Stock Company Registered Captial: €40,000 \n2 Place Jean Miller La Defense 6 92400 Courbevoie France, Companies Register Nanterre R 920 130 440 \nComplanies Register Nanterre \n\n\fFrom our consultations with the fisherfolk and community leaders, the biggest complaint was that they had not been \nproperly  educated  and  sensitised  about  the  allowable  standards  before  the  Fisheries  Protection  Unit  started \nenforcing  the  fishing  regulations.  Fishermen  said  they  were  therefore  not  aware  of  the  consequences  of  non-\ncompliance, as well as the enforcement by the Fisheries Protection Unit under the UPDF. The enforcement by the \nUPDF Fisheries Protection Unit teams therefore found fisherfolk unprepared to comply with the regulations and the \nimpact on their practices.  \n\nIt must be noted that between 2019 and 2024, the actions of the UPDF and the alleged use of excessive force in \ntheir enforcement of fishing restrictions has been discussed several times in the Ugandan Parliament and widely \nreported in the national media1.  \n\nFrom the consultative sessions we held with fisherfolk, they were now more aware of the enforcement of the fishing \nregulations by the army through the training the awareness sessions received from the NGO as well as government \nauthorities and that this activity is unrelated to oil and gas operations of CNOOC, whose operations are within the \nsame communities.  \n\n4.  Allegations of sexual assault \n\nFrom  our  engagements  with  the  district  Probation  officer,  and  local  area  authorities,  allegations  of  sexual \nharassment could not be confirmed as no grievances have been recorded with them in the Kingfisher area.   \n\n1 https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/parliament-halts-updf-fisheries-operations-1865750  \n\nUganda Branch: Plot 21, Yusuf Lule Road, Postal Address: PO Box 34867, Kampala - Uganda \nT.: +256 (0) 312 426000 – Fax: +256 (0) 204 916 999 \n\nTotalEnergies EP Uganda Simplified Joint Stock Company Registered Captial: €40,000 \n2 Place Jean Miller La Defense 6 92400 Courbevoie France, Companies Register Nanterre R 920 130 440 \nComplanies Register Nanterre"}

Through this \nagreement TENBS took on a role of off-taker of the carbon credits generated by the Project. We agreed \nto purchase up to 16.88 million Voluntary Carbon Units (MVCUs) for an amount up to 84.7 million USD \n(MUSD)  over  20  years.  As  of  June  4th,  2024,  TENBS  has  effectively  purchased  10.8  MVCUs.  Of  the \namount  we  disbursed,  ~96%  were  channeled  to  a  trust  fund  where  they  remain  and  generate \nproceeds, the other ~4%, corresponding to a pre-payment, will also be channeled to the trust fund. \nAny future purchase of carbon credits from the CANP by TENBS will continue to feed the trust fund.  \n\nTENBS performed reasonable due diligence and investigations, despite limiting conditions at the time \n(COVID and security conditions within the country). TENBS has also continuously performed reviews \nof the CANP activities, both as a part of its normal conduct of business and as a reaction to the different \nallegations  against  the  CANP.  TENBS  and  its  partner  CIMA  have  worked  together  to  propose \nimprovements related to the management of the CANP and the operational implementation of human \nrights principles. \n\nLand tenure is the core issue today \n\nWe  acknowledge that there  is  a dispute  between your organizations and the Peruvian government \nregarding the creation of the CANP and the ownership entitlement of part of the park. Below are some \nof the elements we have gathered for our knowledge and understanding so far.      \n\nOur due diligence concluded that the creation of the CANP as an administrative procedure complied \nwith  the  laws  in  vigor  in  Peru  at  the  time.  Additionally,  the  Ministry  of  Culture  has  no  registry  of \nindigenous people communities within the park borders, indigenous communities were only identified \nin the buffer zone of the park. Finally, considering the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), although \nILO  169  Convention  had  already  been  ratified  by  Peru  (December  1994),  neither  the  Law  on  Prior \nConsultation  (2011)  nor  its  regulations  (2012)  had  been  promulgated,  therefore,  there  was  no \nestablished procedure, to our knowledge, for carrying out prior consultation. \n\nWe also identified elements showing that in accordance with the regulations of the Protected Natural \nAreas  Law  No.  26834  (17-  Jun-1997)  during  the  process  of  creating  the  Park,  an  information  and \nconsultation process was carried out around the park. The review of the PNCA creation file, revealed \nthat six (6) participatory meetings had been held, in which local authorities, relevant NGOs, logging \ncompanies and communities participated. \n\n \n \n\fAnother element was identified specifically regarding the Puerto Franco community: the community \nsubmitted a file in 07/2016 for the official recognition of the community in which it annexed a map \nshowing that the community only considered areas outside of the CANP as its territory.  \n\nIn addition, and to our knowledge, no specific action was undertaken in relation to the creation of the \nCANP during more than 15 years after its establishment.  \n\nTENBS  is  aware  of  the  claims  that  your  communities  have  been  in  the  region  of  the  park  since \ncenturies. We also heard that, in your opinion, the creation of the CANP violated ILO 169 Convention, \nthat there were other indigenous communities in the area but not dully registered as such, and that a \ntoo limited FPIC process was conducted at the time. TENBS is aware of the different ongoing processes \nboth in Peru and internationally, although, as everyone is aware, the handling of disputes falls within \nthe sovereignty of the judicial institutions of Peru, in application of Peruvian law. \n\nTo our knowledge, local communities have – and have always had - access to the park and are free to \npractice their ancestral traditions. As an example, TENBS was informed that ~6300 individuals accessed \nthe park in the last 20 years to hunt. If those numbers are inaccurate or don’t fully reflect the reality \non the ground, please  share  facts  so that  CIMA and TENBS  can  use  them  to further  investigate.  To \nmanage grievances, CIMA has put in place a logbook at the checkpoints of the park where anyone can \nleave comments or complaints, it is accessible to anyone. \n\nThe trust fund  \n\nAs per Peruvian regulations, the trust fund’s objective is to secure the financing of the CANP in the \nlong-term by protecting it from funding uncertainties that can arise for protected areas. Instead of a \none-off cash inflow, the funds are invested so they can generate a stream of income in the long run. \nSimilar to a pension fund, the preservation of the capital is a key element. We believe this mechanism \nimproves  the  permanence  and  solidifies  a  project  like  the  CANP.  It  secures  the  financing  of \nconservation beyond carbon finance, which is a remarkable achievement.  \n\nThe trust fund, set up on 12/2022, is managed by Profonanpe. TENBS has an observer position in its \nboard with no vote.  The trust  fund is  working as intended  and TENBS will play  its  observer role to \nensure it continues to do so. Finally, any future purchase of carbon credits from the CANP by TENBS \nwill continue to contribute to the trust fund so it can generate more proceeds to drive more impact on \nthe ground.  \n\nLocal & indigenous communities  \n\nTENBS believes the positive involvement of local & indigenous communities is a key component of any \nproject, including projects based on nature as REDD+ projects, such as the one developed on the CANP.   \n\nTENBS  respects  within  its  sphere  of  activities  the  culture,  values  and  lifestyle  of  the  Indigenous \ncommunities. TENBS supports the dialogue so that each member can express his opinion before the \ncommunity and that the community can express their consensus publicly.  \n\nBenefit sharing \n\nTo  our  knowledge,  CIMA  managed  to  work  with  144  communities  so  far,  33  being  indigenous \ncommunities.  Its  action  with  communities  ranges  from:  quality  of  life  planning,  conservation \nagreements, seed financing to impulse sustainable economic development, institutional strengthening \nof  communal  organizations,  technical  assistance  for  productive  activities  and  advice  /  support  on \nadministrative procedures.  \n\n\fCIMA is developing and implementing new type of actions with communities. For example, the first \nedition of the “Emprendedores for Cordillera Azul” recently selected 5 winning projects, presented by \nKichwa,  Shipibo-Konibo  and  Yine  communities,  which  range  from  plantain  and  cocoa  harvesting, \nproduction of artisanal soaps, apiculture, among others.  \n\nFinally, the implementation of the new jurisdictional REDD+ approach in Peru could significantly impact \nthe future revenues from the carbon credit sales of the CANP. If such a context materializes, the trust \nfund mechanism will allow the continuity of actions in the territory as it was designed for.   \n\nContinuous improvement  \n\nThe Project identified several areas of improvement summarized in an action plan structured around \n4 main pillars: 1) Governance of the REDD+ project, 2) Benefit sharing, 3) Dialogue and participation \nof local and indigenous communities and 4) Transparency of the REDD+ project. All future purchases \nof CANP carbon credits from TENBS are conditional on the implementation of this plan.  \n\nIn 10/2023, the ERPA between TENBS and CIMA was supplemented to reflect the above improvement \nprospects which we continue to monitor and assess regularly with CIMA. \n\nComments on other publications   \n\nIn several publications (Shilcayo declaration, report to the CIDH, RFI article for example), you suggested \nthat the use of carbon credits is akin to greenwashing and that they are “a false solution to tackle the \nclimate crisis” (page 4 of the report to the CIDH). Although these controversies are well known, one \ncould be surprised to hear them from indigenous communities. We all know that obviously carbon \ncredits won’t solve all the issues that indigenous communities are facing (that’s not their purpose). \nHowever, no one  can  ignore  that  they can  still bring  some  funding  to communities  in dire  need of \nsupport.  \n\nAccording to TotalEnergies’ sustainability & climate reports, our view is that transitioning is based on \na hierarchy of actions: avoid & reduce first and foremost, and then to compensate residual emissions. \nIn fact, not all emissions generated by any economic activity could simply be avoided or reduced, some \nlevel of compensation will be necessary to reach net zero and carbon credits are useful to that purpose. \nIt is clear to TENBS that its action is the last piece of a much broader transition from TotalEnergies. \nNote that TotalEnergies will only start using its carbon credits from 2030 onwards, after avoid & reduce \nactions are implemented.    \n\nLastly, we noted that the activist Ms. Marisol García Apagüeño, during her recent stay in Paris on the \nsame week as TotalEnergies held its annual general meeting, was protesting in public places with a \nposter indicating that the Peruvian carbon credits including those related to the Project were tainted \nwith blood. Kindly note that, TENBS is not aware of any fact supporting this very serious allegation, but \nwe take it very seriously as well as CIMA and would like you to send us details and facts you may have \non what Ms. Apagüeño meant exactly so that the Project can investigate.  \n\nConclusion \n\nThe  CANP  is  a  unique  park  by  its  size,  the  diversity  of  the  communities  in  its  buffer  zone  and  its \nexceptional biodiversity benefits. We believe such a place needs to be conserved in a participatory \nmanner  with  local  and  indigenous  communities.  TENBS  acknowledges  the  dispute  between  your \norganizations  and  the  Peruvian  government  regarding  the  land  tenure,  and  the  criticisms  you  are \nexpressing towards the management of the park. TENBS would welcome a solution negotiated among \nthe stakeholders involved but we understand it might not be possible today. TENBS, however decided \n\n\fto continue supporting the Project because it believes that its presence in the Project has a positive \nimpact on the management of the CANP and contributes to raising standards and practices. TENBS will \ncontinue to use its influence in the projects as an important off-taker, especially regarding human rights \nrelated aspects. Our team plans to come to Peru in July 2024 where we will go to Lima and we would \nlike to travel to the CANP area if possible. We would be happy to meet representatives of some of your \ncommunities, so as to get direct feedback from them.  \n\nTotalEnergies Sustainability&Climate team"}

CAWDAU is registered as a trade union in the Meng Da factory, which makes adidas footwear product. \nC.CAWDAU claim that there are too many competing trade unions in Meng Da that are under the influence \nof the factory, and that workers are left “confused as to where they should go to resolve issues”. \n\nSince 2010, a total of 17 trade unions have established themselves at Meng Da. These unions are registered \nwith the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT) and have continued to renew their mandates to \nrepresent their members in the factory. Based on the registration certification at MOLVT, we understand \nthat C. CAWDAU was first established at Meng Da in December 2015 and currently represents some 3% of \nthe workforce.  \n\nCollectively,  the  17  active  unions  represent  approximate  2214  members,  or  50%  percent  of  the  total \nworkforce  in  the  factory.  The  4  largest  unions  represent  some  1539  workers.  Based  on  our  own  direct \nmonitoring  we  can  confirm  that  all  trade  unions leaders  who  had  sought  election  as  shop  stewards  (or \nassistant shop stewards) were freely elected by the workers at Meng Da. We have received no reports of \nmanipulation  or  interference  with  that  process,  which  is  overseen  by  the  trade  unions,  the  factory \nmanagement and the MOLVT. \n\nThe elected shop stewards meet weekly and individually with Meng Da’s management team, which provides \nthem with an opportunity to raise any issues of concern. They are also free, should they so wish, to raise \ngrievances directly with the factory’s Human Resource (HR) Department. And indeed, we understand that \nC. CAWDAU has actively used this channel to raise issues on behalf of its members. HR has also established \na  social  media  app  for  the  factory’s  unions,  to  enable  them  to  post  issues  to  HR  that  need  immediate \nattention. This is actively used by all the trade unions. \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fGiven the number of active trade unions in the factory, adidas has asked Meng Da to seek consensus and \nendorsement from each union - irrespective of their size - whenever there are any major changes in the \nworkplace, i.e. with respect to workforce planning, overtime arrangements, etc. This is a practice that has \nbeen in place for many years and Meng Da has fully documented all such union endorsements.   \n\nadidas has a social compliance team based in Cambodia, which regularly visits our suppliers’ factories and \nif any Meng Da registered union perceives that the factory is interfering with their trade union activities, \nthe union can raise complaints directly with adidas. To date, we have received no such complaints from C. \nCAWDAU. \n\nWith respect to worker complaints, there are various channels available at Meng Da and these have been \ncommunicated to the trade unions, to their members and to all workers. Those channels include raising a \ncomplaint directly with the HR department, or anonymously through the digital grievance app, or the more \ntraditional suggestion boxes. If workers require support or representation, they can request the unions or \nshop stewards to act on their behalf, and they frequently do. \n\nIf you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson \nVice President, Global \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

We expect our suppliers to sign and comply with our \nSustainability Commitment which clearly states that these rights are recognized and respected.  \n\nTo support strengthened industrial relations, we have signed a global framework agreement with \nIndustriAll and IF Metal. National Monitoring Committees (NMCs) consisting of H&M Group \nemployees and local trade union representatives implement the agreement in Bangladesh, \nCambodia, India, Indonesia and Türkiye. In 2023, the NMCs covered more than 820,000 workers in \nour tier 1 supply chain and workers raised 23 issues with these committees, 21 of which were \nresolved. The majority of issues raised related to compensation and benefits, as well as severance \npayment.  \n\nTogether with 19 other global brands, we’ve partnered with IndustriALL to form ACT (Action, \nCollaboration, Transformation). Our joint goal is to achieve living wages by supporting collective \nbargaining, freedom of association and responsible purchasing practices. ACT is operating in three key \nproduction countries Bangladesh, Cambodia and Türkiye. \n\nIn 2023, 37% of our tier 1 factories had trade union representation. Additionally, bi-partite \ncommittees are mandatory by local labor law in the majority of production countries where we \noperate, including Bangladesh, Cambodia and Indonesia. In a recent update of the Better Work \nprogramme, the ILO cites well-functioning bipartite committees as part of stronger industrial relations \nthat support better working conditions (ILO 2024). Our public supplier list includes the presence of \ntrade unions and/or democratically elected worker representatives for factories. \n\nWe take violations of freedom of association very seriously and we welcome any complaint on \npossible issues through the channel of our National Monitoring Committees (where present), directly \nwith our teams on the ground or other channels or grievance mechanisms. \n\nPlease find details on the specific cases shared by BHRRC below: \n\nHung Wah, Cambodia \n\nWe can confirm that Hung Wah (Cambodia) is an active supplier to H&M Group.  \n\nAccording to the last report by Better Factories Cambodia (BFC), there are in fact 24 active trade \nunions at the facility, 4 of them are affiliates to IndustriAll. We acknowledge that this might be \nconfusing for workers, but so far we have found no case, nor concern indicating that the rights to \nfreedom of association and collective bargaining are undermined.   \n\nThe last BFC assessment was conducted in October 2023 and no violations with our minimum \nrequirements nor with BFCs critical issues was found as shown in this public overview of findings. \nWithin the area of industrial relations BFCs critical issues include workers right to freely from and join \n(or not to join) a union, no control of nor interference with union by management as well as no \ndiscrimination against workers based on union membership.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDekko Design, Bangladesh \n\nWe can confirm that Dekko Design (Bangladesh) is an active supplier to H&M Group. This case was \nraised through the ACT Interim Dispute Resolution Mechanism and we have been actively involved in \nresolving it through for example fact finding sessions and interviews of impacted workers, mediation \nrole between the two parties (management and trade union) and follow up with factory management \non the actions points agreed in meetings with the parties. In that process we collaborated with \nIndustriAll, their affiliate trade union BGIWF, factory management and other brands sourcing from \nDekko Design and we are thankful to all stakeholders who contributed to that an agreement could be \nreached in the end.  Read more about this case here.  \n\nPT Sai Apparel, Indonesia \n\nWe can confirm that PT Sai Apparel, Indonesia is an active supplier to H&M Group.  \n\nThe last assessment by Better Work Indonesia was conducted in December 2023 and revealed \nindications of preferential treatment towards one union.  \n\nWe are actively involved in this case and our colleagues in Indonesia have been in direct contact with \nthe trade union, the supplier and Better Work Indonesia to help resolve it. We have made it clear to \nthe supplier that we expect them to uphold Freedom of Association and that discrimination based on \nunion status is unacceptable. We encouraged them to continue to build a social dialogue between \nworkers/unions and management in the factory, specifically to resolve any issue that may arise at the \nfactory in good faith. We will continue to work on this issue with local stakeholders.  \n\nWe recognise that the risk of labour rights violations exists in all countries and across our value chain \nand we are very committed to assessing risks and thoroughly investigate when we hear of allegations \nand issues that should be addressed. One way to ensure access to remedy when violations occur are \neffective grievance mechanisms. We expect all our suppliers to have a grievance mechanism in place \nso that workers can raise a concern. \n\nIn 2023 we updated our Labour Rights Survey, which monitors workplace dialogue and grievance \nmechanisms. More than 205,000 workers completed the worker survey which we combined with a \nselection of third party factory data (collected through HIGG FSLM). As a result, we have visibility of \nhow effective factory grievance mechanisms are according to the UNGPs criteria. We are now \nworking with our strategic suppliers to create tailored roadmaps designed to strengthen social \ndialogue and grievance mechanisms in the factories in order to improve access to remedy for \nworkers."}

On the other hand, EACOP Ltd. oversees the \nconstruction of the crude oil pipeline.  \n\nResponding to your query, we’d like to state that the above press articles claim incidents occurring to \nhuman rights defenders and referring to events that are completely unrelated to our activities.  \n\nKindly refer to our arguments below: \n\n1.  The  villages  in  question  are  situated  several  kilometers  away  from  either  Tilenga  or  EACOP \ninfrastructure. The land in question is not affected by the  projects and is not  part of the land \nacquisition programme. Additionally, none of the persons mentioned in the article are Tilenga \nor EACOP Project Affected Persons (i.e., persons whose assets or land are part of the projects \nland acquisition programme).   \n\n2.  Moreover, neither  TEPU  and  EACOP Ltd  have  any  record of persons, NGOs or Human Rights \n\nDefenders raising concerns or grievances in relation to this land. \n\n3.  Further, neither of TEPU or EACOP Ltd work with an organisation called Magnum Security. \n4.  Nevertheless, we have sought clarification from the relevant authorities regarding the claims. \nWe  understand  that  the  evictions  may  have  been  conducted  by  a  private  individual  who \nclaimed that the evicted persons were occupying his land unlawfully.  \n\nWe would like to highlight that the land acquisition process undertaken by TEPU and EACOP Ltd respects \nlocal laws and regulations and is compliant with the International Financing Standards (IFS), including \nIFC Performance Standard 5 on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement.  \n\nFinally, in line with TotalEnergies’ approach to respecting human rights  of any stakeholders including \nhuman  rights  defenders,  TEPU  recognizes  the  importance  of  protecting  human  rights  defenders and \ndoes not accept any threat or attack against those who peacefully defend and promote human rights in \nconnection with its activities. (See the TEPU’s  Statement on Human Rights Defenders (HRD)). Also note \n\n \n\fEACOP  Ltd’s  commitment  to  respecting  human  rights  in  all  its  activities  and  its  recognition  of  the \nimportant role of human rights defenders in promoting human rights (https://eacop.com/human-rights-\npolicy/). \n\nYours sincerely,  \n\nSustainability and Climate team \n\nTotalEnergies"}

We wish to clarify that the villages in question, notably Runga and Kiryatete, were \ninitially identified during the planning phase as potential areas to be affected by the project and initial \ndisclosure engagements took place. However, once project footprint had been fully mapped, it became \napparent that the above villages would not be affected by the feeder pipelines as they are situated several \nkilometers  from  either  Tilenga  or  EACOP  infrastructure.  Consequently,  these  villages  were  kept  clear \nduring construction and none of the persons mentioned in this article are either Tilenga or EACOP PAPs. \nHence, there was no further engagement on the acquisition of the land in the said villages.  \n\nIt  is  therefore  misleading  to  suggest  that  TotalEnergies  and  its  projects  have  caused  or  are  partly \nresponsible for evictions from land in which they have no footprint.   \n\nWe therefore invite you to correct this false assertion in the rejoinder. \n\nWe would like to reiterate that the land acquisition process undertaken by both TEPU and EACOP Ltd \nrespects  local  laws  and  regulations  and  is  compliant  with  international  standards.  Additionally,  the \ncompanies do not condone the use of threats, violence, or force in any of their activities.  \n\nKind regards,"}

We would like to \n\nclarify the following points regarding the accusations in the article: \n\n1.Regarding Community Relations \n\n(1) Regarding Land Permits \n\nThe land acquisition and land use processes in Zeravshan strictly adhere to laws and \n\nregulations, including planning, application submission, village consultations, obtaining \n\ngovernment approvals at all levels, and obtaining land rights certificates, all of which \n\nhave been approved and documented. Our company has always adhered to the \n\nprinciple of voluntariness in the process of signing land sale or acquisition agreements \n\nwith villagers, ensuring that all transactions take place in a fair and transparent \n\nenvironment. We have retained all signed contract texts and have paid agricultural \n\nlosses and development compensation to the original land users based on legal \n\nframeworks and negotiations. Additionally, we have established a comprehensive \n\ncommunity communication and grievance mechanism. Villagers can use this \n\nmechanism to request the company to meet their reasonable demands in case of \n\ndisputes during the land permit acquisition process. \n\n(2) Regarding Community Investment Commitments \n\nThe company has been fulfilling its obligations to develop Khumgaron Village as \n\nplanned. Completed community investment projects include the restoration of a 4-\n\nkilometer road between Khumgaron Village and Chorbog Village, the construction of a \n\nwater pipeline worth 1.04 million somoni, the restoration of the No. 83 school in the \n\nvillage worth over 55,000 somoni, and the payment of a 2.7 million somoni guarantee.  \n\nThe company is committed to building good relationships with all surrounding \n\ncommunities to ensure that they benefit from the development of the mine. We have \n\nmade investments in community traditional agriculture, specialty crop industry \n\ndevelopment, infrastructure construction, assistance to vulnerable groups, and \n\neducation, health, culture, and sports facilities construction, with the company's \n\ninvestment in the community exceeding 13.28 million US dollars. \n\n2.Regarding Environmental Protection \n\n(1) Regarding the Impact on Surrounding Crops \n\n \n \n\fGlobal warming and the drying up of the Aral Sea have had a widespread impact on the \n\necology of Central Asia, which is a well-known fact. In recent years, the black sand \n\ncarried by the westerly winds has also affected the Zeravshan Valley, causing trees and \n\ncrops to be covered in black ash, affecting the growth of crops and fruits. Upon learning \n\nof this situation, the company organized relevant training to help farmers cope with \n\nthese natural phenomena. Farmers who have acquired knowledge and taken measures \n\nhave successfully avoided the impact of black ash. In the future, the company will \n\ncontinue to provide training to community farmers to help them better cope with the \n\nchallenges brought about by climate change. \n\n(2) Regarding Water Quality \n\nThe accusation in the article about causing the death of a large number of fish and fines \n\nis not based on solid evidence and is unfounded. The company places a high priority on \n\nwater resource protection and employs advanced wastewater treatment and water \n\nrecycling processes and technologies, achieving zero external discharge of wastewater. \n\nTo ensure that the water quality around the mine is not affected by the company's \n\nproduction activities, the company has installed modern water quality monitoring \n\nstations upstream and downstream of the Mogiyon River flowing through the mining \n\narea, with water quality at all 52 monitoring points meeting standards. The company \n\nregularly invites environmental organizations, trade unions, and community \n\nrepresentatives to attend public disclosure meetings of environmental test results and \n\ndiscloses data tested by the national central laboratory to the environmental protection \n\nagency and the community to ensure transparency in environmental information. In \n\naddition, the analysis and monitoring center under the government's environmental \n\nprotection committee has conducted multiple monitoring of the water, soil, and air \n\nenvironment around the company, with the results meeting relevant standards. \n\n3.Regarding Public Health \n\nThe company has obtained health-related certificates issued by the Panjakent City \n\nHealth and Epidemic Prevention Station and Hospital, showing that gold mining has not \n\naffected health issues. The average birth rate in Panjakent City and rural areas is 23.5‰, \n\nwhile the average birth rate in the Kosatarosh Township community is 24‰, with no \n\nsignificant difference in birth rates between rural areas around the company and the \n\ncity area, and even some rural areas have higher birth rates than the city average. \n\nAccording to the 2021 statistical medical report, the cancer incidence rate in the \n\nKosatarosh Township community is the same as in other township communities in \n\nPanjakent City. \n\n3.Regarding the Allegations of Operating without Licenses and Being Fined for \n\n\fEnvironmental Damage: After verifying with relevant departments, there have been no \n\nsuch allegations, and the accusation is unfounded. \n\nZeravshan operates the mine with high environmental standards, promoting local \n\neconomic and social development with the concept of \"common development,\" and \n\nwelcomes supervision from all stakeholders of the company. \n\nESG Office \n\nZijin Mining Group Co., LTD. \n\n \n \n \n\f尊敬的商业和人权资源中心： \n\n我们收到您的来函，同时也关注到了这篇文章，现对文章中的指控进行如下澄\n\n清： \n\n1.  关于社区关系 \n\n（1）关于土地许可 \n\n泽拉夫尚征地、用地过程严格遵守法律法规，包括制定规划、提交申请、村民协\n\n商、获得政府三级审批、办理土地权证等，均获得相应批准并留有文件。我们公司在\n\n与村民签订土地出售或征地协议的过程中，始终坚持自愿性原则，并确保所有交易都\n\n在公平、透明的环境中进行，我们保留了所有经双方签字的合同文本，并基于法律框\n\n架和协商基础上向土地原使用者支付了农业损失和开发补偿金。同时我们建立了完善\n\n的社区沟通与申诉机制，村民如在取得土地许可的过程中出现争议，可通过申诉机制\n\n要求公司满足其合理诉求。 \n\n（2）关于社区投入承诺 \n\n公司按计划持续履行发展洪格隆村的义务，已完成的社区投资项目包括修复洪格\n\n隆村-乔理保格公路 4 公里，修建供水管道价值为 104 万索莫尼，修复村里第 83 号学\n\n校价值超过 5.5 万索莫尼，并支付 270 万索莫尼的担保金。 \n\n公司致力于与所有周边社区建立良好关系，使周边社区共享矿山发展成果。在社\n\n区传统农业和特色种植产业发展、基础设施建设、弱势群体帮扶、教育卫生文化体育\n\n设施建设等方面都有不同程度的投入，公司对社区的投入超过 1328 万美元。 \n\n2.  关于环保 \n\n（1）  关于周边农作物受影响问题 \n\n全球变暖和咸海干涸对中亚生态造成广泛影响，这是广为人知的事实。近年来，\n\n西风携带的黑色沙尘也对泽拉夫尚山谷地区造成了影响，导致树木和农作物表面附着\n\n黑灰，影响农作物和水果生长。公司在了解到这一情况后，组织了相关培训，帮助农\n\n民应对这些自然现象，部分掌握了知识并采取了应对措施的农民成功避免了黑灰的影\n\n响。未来公司还将继续对社区农民提供培训，帮助他们更好地应对气候变化带来的挑\n\n战。 \n\n（2）  关于水质问题 \n\n关于文中提到的大量鱼类死亡及被罚款的指控，没有扎实的事实依据，为不实指\n\n控。公司高度重视水资源保护，采用先进的废水处理和水循环工艺和技术，实现了废\n\n水对外零排放。为确保矿山周边水质不受公司生产活动影响，公司在流经矿区的马吉\n\n \n\f安河上下游均安装有现代化水质监测站，52 个监测点水质均达标。公司定期邀请环保\n\n组织、工会、社区代表参加环境检测结果公示会，并向环保局和社区披露国家中心实\n\n验室检测的数据，确保环境信息公开透明。另外，政府环保委员会下属的分析监控中\n\n心多次对公司周围的水、土壤和空气环境状况进行监测，结果均符合相关标准。 \n\n3.  关于公共健康 \n\n公司取得了彭吉肯特市卫生防疫站及医院开具的与健康相关证明，数据显示金矿\n\n开采并未影响健康问题。彭吉肯特市和乡村的平均出生率为 23.5‰，科萨塔罗舍乡的\n\n平均出生率为 24‰，公司周边乡村出生率与市区平均出生率并无明显差别，甚至个别\n\n乡村出生率高于市区平均出生率。根据 2021 年统计医疗报告的数据，科萨塔罗舍乡的\n\n癌症发病率与彭吉肯特市其他乡相同。 \n\n4.  关于未取得证照及对环境造成损害进行罚款：经与相关机构核实查证，未发\n\n生过指控相关事宜，该指控不实。 \n\n泽拉夫尚以高环保标准运营矿山，以“共同发展”理念促进当地经济和社会发展，同\n\n时也接受和欢迎社会各界监督。 \n\nESG 办公室 \n\n紫金矿业集团股份有限公司"}

To ensure that the Government Security Forces \nequally respect these rights, the Companies have maintained regular engagement with them. The \nrelationship is managed by Companies’ Security/ NGO & Human Rights teams which continuously \nengage  with  Police  by  raising  their  awareness  of  the  national  and  international  human  rights \nstandards of law enforcement and the human rights implications of arrests during protests. \n\nThe Companies take a proactive approach to ensuring that the project is implemented in accordance \nwith internationally recognized human rights standards and the Voluntary Principles on Security and \nHuman Rights (VPSHR). The Companies communicate with relevant government officials on Human \nRights  and  advocate  for  professional  conduct  of  police  and  army  units.  In  particular,  they  have \norganized trainings of law enforcement officers and security officers on VPSHR and internationally \nrecognized human rights. In 2024 alone, 85 Government Security personnel from Uganda Oil and Gas \nPolice,  Tourism  Police  and  Uganda  Wildlife  Authority  Rangers,  have  participated  as  well  as  794 \nPrivate  Security  Guards  working  on  the  project  sites.  The  trainings  cover  themes  related  to  the \nprotection of human rights, particularly those of HRDs.  \n\nAs soon as the Companies are informed of ongoing demonstrations, they usually mobilize personnel \nto the site of the protest to seek to engage with protestors and understand their concerns and receive \ntheir petition if any. \n\nIn addition, whenever TEPU is alerted of allegations of threats, intimidation, harassment, or violence \nagainst Human Rights Defenders in relation to its activities or EACOP Ltd.’s activities in Uganda, the \nCountry Security Team will typically visit the police station and request information on the protestors’ \nwelfare,  and  advocate  for  the  need  to  respect  the  human  rights  of  the  HRDs.  Where  particular \nconcerns are raised in this regard, TEPU may escalate its engagement for instance by contacting the \nCommander of the Uganda Oil and Gas Police, or the Ministry of the Internal Affairs.   \n\nFor  example,  during  the  recent  protests  of  9th  and  26th  August  2024,  TEPU’s  security  department \nclosely monitored the two cases of arrests and detention. In both instances, we  engaged with the \npolice to ensure that the demonstrators' rights and well-being were respected throughout the legal \nproceedings.  All  47  arrested  protestors  of  August  9th  2024  were  released  the  same  day  after \nidentifying themselves, while the 20 protestors from 26th August 2024 demonstration were charged \nin court. They were granted bail on 6th September 2024.  \n\nOn  both  occasions,  TEPU  engaged  closely  with  the  local  police,  attending  court  hearings  and \nmaintaining regular contact with the Oil and Gas Police commander to ensure the demonstrators' \nrights are respected.  \n\n\fTEPU  and  EACOP  reiterate  that  open  dialogue  with  civil  society  is  essential  and  welcome  the \nopportunity to engage in constructive dialogue as we work together to obtain long lasting peaceful \nsolutions.  \n\nFor more information, please refer to: \n\n- \n\nTotalEnergies’  Universal  Registration  Document  2023  (TotalEnergies  -  2023  Universal \nRegistration  Document  p168),  TotalEnergies Uganda  website  Sustainability  |  TotalEnergies \nUganda and Eacop Website : EACOP – – East African Crude Oil Pipe Line. \n\n-  Our CEO response at the French Senate that we invite you to consult below: CE Obligations \n\n- \n\nde TotalEnergies : compte-rendu de la semaine du 29 avril 2024 (senat.fr) \nThe  response  to  report  by  Just  Finance  International  on  alleged  human  rights  abuses  in \nKingfisher project area - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (bhrrc.org)"}

To  encourage  the  Government  Security  Forces  to  equally  respect  these  rights,  the \nCompanies have maintained regular engagement with them.  \n\nThe  Companies  take  a  proactive  approach  to  ensuring  that  the  projects  are  implemented  in \naccordance with internationally recognized human rights standards and the Voluntary Principles \non Security and Human Rights (VPSHR).  This has been done through organized trainings offered \nby the Companies to law enforcement officers and security officers on VPSHR and internationally \nrecognized human rights. In 2024 alone, 110 Government Security personnel from Uganda Oil \nand Gas Police, Tourism Police and Uganda Wildlife Authority Rangers, have participated as well \nas 1042 Private Security Guards working on the project sites. The trainings cover themes related \nto the respect of human rights, particularly those of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs).  \n\nAs mentioned in our previous letters, where protestors against the projects are arrested by the \nPolice, TEPU contacts the responsible authorities to advocate for respect of the protesters’ rights \nwhile in detention, including their right to legal representation, and that they are accorded due \nprocess in accordance with the law.  \n\nRegarding the arrest of 15 activists on 11th November 2024, the Companies were made aware of \nthe  arrests  through  social  media.  Our  team  promptly  engaged  with  the  Officer  in  Charge  of \nOperations,  and  2  other  senior  officers  at  the  Central  Police  station  where  the  activists  were \nbeing  held,  to  remind the  Police  of the need  to ensure  that legal  due process  is followed,  the \nprotestors  are  treated  well,  and  their  rights  are  respected  while  in  detention.  Despite  our \nengagements with Police and advocating for their release, the Police maintained their protocols, \ncharged them in court the same day and remanded them to prison. The activists are scheduled \nto return to court on 26th November 2024 for their bail hearing. \n\nThe  Companies  have  continued  to  monitor  the  wellbeing  of  the  protestors  pending  their  bail \nhearing,  and  Company  representatives  visited  them  in  prison  on  13th,  14th  and  19th  November \nrespectively. TEPU has also provided some support towards purchase of personal effects which \nhad been requested by the remanded protestors and this has been greatly appreciated. \n\nTEPU  and  EACOP  reiterate  that  open  dialogue  with  civil  society  is  essential  and  welcome  the \nopportunity  to  engage  in  constructive  dialogue  as  we  work  together  to  obtain  long  lasting \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n\fpeaceful  solutions.  This  same  message  has  been  communicated  to  the  Minister  of  Internal \nAffairs (which is in charge of internal security matters), on several occasions. \n\nFor more information, please refer to:  \n\n \n \n\nTEPU Statement on Human Rights Defenders  \nTotalEnergies’ Universal Registration Document 2023 (TotalEnergies - 2023 \n\nUniversal Registration Document p168), TotalEnergies Uganda website TotalEnergies Uganda \nwebsite Sustainability, and Eacop Website : EACOP  – East African Crude Oil Pipe Line.   \n\n \n\nOur CEO response at the French Senate that we invite you to consult below: CE \n\nObligations de TotalEnergies : compte-rendu de la semaine du 29 avril 2024 (senat.fr)   \n\n \n\nThe response to report by Just Finance International on alleged human rights \n\nabuses in Kingfisher project area - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (bhrrc.org)   \n\n \n\nResponse to BHRRC inquiry in relation to demonstrations and arrests on 9 and \n\n26 August 2024: Total_Energies_response_August_2024.pdf"}

We  greatly  appreciate  and  commend  your \nimpartial  and  objective  approach  in  considering  and  publishing  the  company's  statements  and \nclarifications on this matter.   \n\nFirst  and  foremost,  we  express  deep  concern  regarding  the  health  issues  mentioned  in  the \nMongabay report involving artisanal miners and extend our sympathy for their situation. However, \nwe would like to clarify that, as of the publication of Mongabay's report, COMMUS has not received \nany  complaints  concerning  such  health  issues  allegedly  caused  by  mining  activities,  whether \nthrough  government  or  community  channels,  or  via \nits  community  office,  community \nrepresentatives, phone lines, or email. Nor did Mongabay seek inquiries or file complaints with us. \nThis does not match Mongabay's assertion that Zijin Mining Group and COMMUS were contacted. \n\nAfter  a  thorough  review  of  the  report,  we  believe  that  Mongabay  may  have  confused  the \ndistinctions  and  relationships  between  Artisanal  and  Small-scale  Mining  (ASM)  and  Large-scale \nMining (LSM). For reference, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) provides the \nfollowing challenges regarding ASM: \"The ASM sector often lacks basic worker health and safety \nprovisions  and  workplace  dangers  include  a  lack  of  training,  poor  ventilation,  lack  of  safety \nequipment,  improper  use  of  chemicals,  and  outdated  equipment.  Women  and  children  are \nfrequently  involved.\"  (https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/our-work/social-performance/indigenous-\npeoples-and-human-rights/collaborate-artisanal-mining) As an LSM operation, COMMUS adheres \nto strict standards and protocols concerning safety, health, and environmental protection. Based \non these clarifications, we would like to make the following statements: \n\n1. \n\nThe individuals interviewed in the report are local female miner engaged in ASM. Statements \nmade  by  Suzanne  Ngwewe  and  Kulemba  Samba  also  confirm  that  these  women  lack  the \nnecessary  personal  protective  equipment,  and  that  unregulated,  unprotected  artisanal \nmining poses serious negative impacts on their safety, health, and the natural environment. \nAccording to data from institutions like the World Bank, approximately 10 million people in \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) directly or indirectly depend on the ASM sector, and \nASM accounts for about 20% of the mining production in the DRC. To address these issues, \nthe DRC has established SAEMAPE (Service for Assistance and Management of Artisanal and \nSmall-scale Mining) to oversee and regulate ASM activities, with professional ASM groups and \norganizations also established locally. The societal challenges faced by the ASM sector require \njoint attention and support from all stakeholders worldwide. As stated in the report, these \nartisanal miners have entered the COMMUS waste dump area illegally. Out of consideration \nfor their livelihoods, COMMUS does not enforce evictions but has attempted to guide them \naway in an orderly manner. However, it should be noted that these miners mainly collect hard \nrocks from the dump site for use as building materials, rather than extracting ore. \n\n2.  As a responsible LSM, COMMUS places a high priority on the management of environmental \nprotection, occupational health and safety, and strives to minimize any impact on surrounding \ncommunities,  residents,  and  employees  (including  contractors).  For  instance,  COMMUS \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fprovides  occupational  health  and  safety  training  for  employees,  equips  them  with \ncomprehensive  protective equipment,  and  undertakes extensive  greening  and landscaping \nefforts in the factory area and waste dump slopes. Additionally, COMMUS has constructed \nretaining walls and dust suppression systems along the ore transport route and around the \nplant  boundaries.  In  collaboration  with  relevant  government  regulatory  bodies,  COMMUS \nalso  regularly  conducts  water  and  air  quality  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with \nenvironmental  standards.  Under  such  rigorous  management,  COMMUS  has  maintained \nfavorable occupational health and safety performance levels and has been actively engaging \nwith stakeholders to improve its performance. \n\n3. \n\nTo  enhance  COMMUS's  grievance  mechanism  and  ensure  that  health  and  safety  concerns \nfrom  local  residents  are  not  overlooked,  our  field  team  visited  other  hospitals  in  the \ncommunity  where  the  report's  referenced  hospital  is  located.  However,  the  results \ncontradicted the claims made in the Mongabay report. After reviewing the past three years' \nmedical  data  from  EMERGENCE,  BORA,  and  PRODIGE  DE  L'ETERNEL  hospitals  in  the  same \ncommunity,  we  found  no  evidence  of  the  purported  disease  surge.  Moreover,  COMMUS \nvisited  Polyclinique  Manass é ,  which  provides  medical  care  to  our  employees  and  their \nfamilies, and also found no evidence of such issues. \n\n4.  Over the years, in line with our commitment to \"Mining for a Better Society,\" COMMUS has \nbeen actively listening to community opinions and needs to help improve the quality of life \nfor residents. However, it is undeniable that with the rapid expansion of Kolwezi city, there \nhas  been  a  constant  influx  of  migrants,  which  has  brought  new  social  challenges  to \ncommunities  like  the  one  where  the  Trinité  Medical  Center  is  located.  COMMUS  remains \ncommitted  to  fulfilling  its  social  responsibilities  by  community  investments  and  welfare  in \nareas such as water supply, education, and healthcare to alleviate these new social issues and \nhelp improve residents' quality of life. \n\nIn  conclusion,  we  would  like  to  reiterate  that,  as  a  responsible  mining  company,  COMMUS  will \ncontinue to strictly comply with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards in the DRC, and \ncarry out robust and responsible management of environmental protection, occupational health \nand safety. We are also committed to subjecting ourselves to oversight from various government \nauthorities, social institutions, and local communities. \n\nThank you again for your email and attention. \n\nYours sincerely, \n\nGAO Juntao \nAssistant to ESG Officer \nZijin Mining Group Co., Ltd."}

These  allegations  are  founded  on  preconceived  assumptions, \nignoring positive evidence, and leading to misleading conclusions. \n\nImportantly, Serbia ZiJin Copper doo Bor (SZC) fully adheres to the  SA8000 standard, the \nworld's \nleading  social  certification  program.  This  compliance  encompasses \nrequirements  of  the  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO)  and  its  conventions, \nincluding  those  concerning  forced  or  compulsory  labor,  working  hours,  freedom  of \nmovement, earnings, accommodation, healthcare, nutrition, legal rights, and more. Its \ncompliance  has  been  validated  through  third-party  certification,  demonstrating  that  its  work \nsystem aligns with ILO standards. All relevant documentation is up-to-date, and SZC ensures \nthe  dissemination  of  SA8000  system  documentation  to  all  employees.  Printed versions of \napplicable  procedures  and  instructions  are  distributed  across  all  locations  and \nfactories, ensuring its employees are well-aware of their rights and obligations. \n\nMoreover, adherence to the SA8000 standard is a mandate not only for SZC but also for its \ncontractors and suppliers, ensuring consistent implementation of these standards in ongoing \noperations. \n\nSZC  fosters  transparent  communication,  including  anonymous  channels  for  reviewing \ndocumentation and submitting complaints or objections to management. Its website offers an \nemail  address  for  anonymous  correspondence,  and  employees  are  made  aware  they  can \ncontact the certification body directly. Secure mailboxes, unmonitored by cameras, are also \navailable for personal deliveries. \n\nAdditionally, we suggest you to consider evidence contradicting China Labor Watch's claims, \nwhich they have selectively overlooked. For instance, the report \"JINSHAN: Kineski radnici bili \nuznemireni \nlažne \ninformacije\"(https://istmedia.rs/jinshan-kineski-radnici-bili-uznemireni-zbog-korone-a-neki-od-\nnjih-sirili-lazne-informacije/)    provides a fact different with China Labor Watch. \n\nkorone \n\nzbog \n\nneki \n\nširili \n\nnjih \n\nod \n\na \n\nWe would also like to highlight the positive contributions SZC has made under our “Mining for \na  Better  Society”  philosophy.  Since  SZC's  entry  into  Bor  in  2018,  the  “Zijin  Model”  has \nrevitalized  the  century-old  Bor  copper  mine,  previously  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy.  This \ntransformation has resulted in the creation of 13,000 local jobs, including the recruitment of \nover 4,600 new employees from the region. In the past six years, the employees' average \nsalary  has  increased  by  more  than  100%.  Our  efforts  have  driven  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of Serbia’s mining industry, enhancing the well-being of local communities and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\flaying a robust foundation for shared growth and prosperity. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, \n\nGAO Juntao \nESG Office \nZijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. \n\n \n \n \n\fHere are some pictures on the living and working conditions of our employees:"}

Firstly,  its  content  does  not \nreflect  in  any  way  the  quality  of  policies,  mechanisms  and  actions  taken  on  the  ground  and  the \nprogress made by TotalEnergies EP Uganda (TEPU) in the field of Human Rights. Furthermore, the \ndraft report reflects neither our transparency practices nor our discussions over the last four years.  \n\nThe way in which the report is presented is questionable and is not at all balanced or representative \nof  the  reality  on  the  ground.  Feedback  from  local  communities  indicate  that  TEPU’s  actions  to \naddress  project’s  impacts,  to  remedy  these  and  to  bring  benefits  are  appreciated.  Although  we \nrecognize there is still room for improvement, TEPU rejects the false statement contained in the draft \nreport.  \n\nOver the past four years, we have maintained continuous dialogue and shared numerous documents \nand information with your organization. Additionally, we have made information about the Tilenga \nProject publicly available. This should have enabled you to document the report more thoroughly \nand recognize the quality and progress of our Company’s social performance.  \n\nWe  are  surprised  to  find  that  your  draft  report  primarily  highlights  some  malfunctions  without \nacknowledging the policies, mechanisms and actions we have implemented. This raises concerns \nabout  the  validity  of  your  survey  methodology  and  the  representativeness  of  the  individuals \ninterviewed. \n\nAdditionally,  we  disagree  with  the  document’s  portrayal  of  TotalEnergies’  responsibilities  in  the \nmentioned projects (Tilenga, EACOP, Kingfisher). As previously stated, TEPU serves as the operating \npartner for the Tilenga project and as an investing partner, alongside the operating partner CNOOC \nUganda  ltd  for  the  Kingfisher  project.  TotalEnergies  is  a  shareholder  in  EACOP  Ltd,  which  is \nresponsible for the EACOP project.  \n\nAs we have discussed in various occasions, whether we act as an operating partner or an investing \npartner, we conduct our projects and we encourage our partners to conduct projects in accordance \nwith highest international standards, including  the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business \nand Human Rights (UNGPs).  \ndocuments, \nAs \nhas \nTEPU \nResponse_to_BHRRC_on_alleged_human_righs_abuses_in_Kingfisher_project_area.pdf, \npreviously demonstrated its commitment to exerting influence and promoting transparency.  We would \nlike to remind you that, in line with our Human Rights Policy, we take human rights issues very seriously \n\nmentioned \n\navailable \n\npublicly \n\nin \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fand  remain  in  constant  contact  with  our  partners,  including  CNOOC  and  other  stakeholders.  We  will \ncontinue to engage with our partners and leverage our influence to foster respect for human rights within \nall impacted communities. \n\nWe  also  observe  that  the  draft  report  fails  to  distinguish  between  the  Government  of  Uganda’s \nsovereignty  and  mandate,  such  as  for  land  compensation  matters,  and  TEPU’s  contractual  & \nstatutory responsibilities and accountabilities. This lack of distinction  contributes to a  climate of \nconfusion which is detrimental to all stakeholders and calls into question the impartiality of the draft \nreport.  \n\nRegarding the Human Rights Defenders situation extensively highlighted in your draft report, we would \nlike to reiterate our awareness of the need for great attention.  Consistent with our internal policies and \nmechanisms, we regularly remind public authorities of the critical attention required for this matter. \n\nWe sincerely hope that the above remarks will be duly considered by your organization in your analysis of \nthe  projects  in  which  TEPU  is  involved  in  Uganda.  This  is  essential  to  ensure  the  quality  and \nrepresentativeness  of  the  report  but  also  to  enable  the  fruitful  continuation  of  our  future  exchanges, \nwhich we believe have mutually enriched both parties.    \n\nYours Faithfully \n\nPhilippe Groueix \n\nGeneral Manager TotalEnergies EP Uganda"}

Most workers are housed in closed camps either \noperated by TEPU (Bugungu, Buliisa and Tangi camps as well as accommodation facilities on well \npads) or operated by a contractor (such as the McDermott and Sinopec camp within the Industrial \nArea). \n\n-  Measures to Reduce Risk of Commercial Sex Work : \nHUMAN RIGHTS REPORT 2023 AMENDED3 (page 36) \n\nSubcontractor Labour Rights (worker voice) \n\nAs mentioned previously, TEPU has in place the Fundamental Principles of Purchasing (FPP) that guides \ncontracts with contractors. Contract provisions include requirements to incorporate the principles in the \nFPPs in sub-contracts.  \nTEPU  offers  trainings  to  convey  our  company’s  human  rights  commitments  and  outline  the  specific \nexpectations we have for contractors and subcontractors.  \nIn addition to the above, the company requires all contractors to establish internal grievance mechanisms \nto provide channels of redress for disputes that arise in the employment relationship, and to develop good \nworkplace practices aimed at preventing labour rights infringements. \n\nIn 2023, the “Worker’s Voice Tool” for monitoring contractors’ workers’ grievances and complaints \nwas rolled out at 2 contractor sites. Surveys are launched every 3 months. This initiative has allowed \nthe  Project  to  collect  continuous  feedback  on  working  conditions  on  site  directly  from  workers \nthrough surveys sent to their mobile phones, understand any emerging issues that arose during the \n3-month period covered by that survey and make fast corrective actions before they escalate. With \neach  survey,  TEPU has been  able  to  exercise its leverage  to remind the contractors to develop an \naction plan to address issues identified. \n\n-  About detailed information regarding collaboration with contractors, you can consult : \n\nHUMAN RIGHTS REPORT 2023 AMENDED3 (page 9) \n\nWith regard to EACOP, as stated in their environmental and social management plan, contractors’ \nenvironment  &  social  management  processes  and  capabilities  are  evaluated  as  part  of  the \ncontractor selection process to ensure that they can meet the defined minimum requirements of the \nproject (see document below page 25). \n\nESMP-ONLINE-COPY-APPROVED-.pdf \n\nFloodings close to CPF \n\nIn  May  2022  and  again  in  March  2023  and  early  2024,  Buliisa  district  experienced  heavy  downpours \nresulting in the occurrence of flash floods in some areas close to the Central Processing Facility (CPF) and \nin some instances, impacting neighbouring land.    \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n\fMeasures have been put in place to address the flooding around the project facilities that are in \nflood prone areas, including the construction of retention ponds at the industrial area. The ponds \nare designed to retain surface rainwater runoff within Industrial Area so that the outflow is gradual and \ncontrolled  and  the  consequences  arising  from  excessive  runoff  downstream of the  Industrial  Area  are \nmitigated. Retention ponds have also been established at all well pads in the south, additional land was \npurchased outside the industrial area for water management. Studies to determine additional measures \nto manage surface water runoff are ongoing.  \n\nPAPs who were affected by excess storm runoff were compensated for crop losses following assessment \nand verification exercise. For example, farmers whose gardens were impacted in 2022 have since been \ncompensated by TEPU following approval of the loss assessment report by the Chief Government Valuer \nin the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development. For the farmers whose gardens were affected \nin 2023 and early 2024, assessments were carried out and compensation was effected for the affected \npeople. Additionally, land has been purchased outside the industrial area to manage surface water and \nprevent flooding in future. \n\nHuman Wildlife conflicts \n\nAs  previously  mentioned  in  our  correspondence,  TEP  Uganda  has  been  working  with  Wildlife \nConservation  Society  (WCS)  and  the  Uganda  Wildlife  Authority  (UWA)  in  monitoring  the  ranging \nbehaviour  of  elephants  in  and  around  Murchison  Falls  National  Park.  The  program  involves  GPS \ncollaring of female and male elephants to understand their individual movement patterns, and this \nhas  been  ongoing  since  2013.

It should be noted RAID and CAJJ’s report was for a number of \ncobalt producers in the DRC, not specifically KCC. In terms of the work we have \nundertaken, we developed a living wage methodology to evaluate the status of our \nemployee salaries (including benefits) against local living wage data. We worked with \nBusiness for Social Responsibility (BSR) on the provision of local living wage information as \na comparison of the payroll and benefits data relating to our employees. We continually \nreview salaries and discuss them with union representatives as part of collective \nbargaining agreements to ensure that our wages are competitive in the market.  \n\nGlencore’s Supplier Code of Conduct requires companies supplying contractors to comply \nwith all applicable laws, including those concerning labour rights. Our Supplier Code of \nConduct also sets an expectation that our suppliers respect the ILO Core Labour \nStandards, treat their workers fairly and with respect and respects the rights to lawful \nfreedom of association and collective bargaining. We expect our suppliers to offer fair and \ntransparent terms and conditions of employment including fair remuneration, working \nhours, and working conditions. In addition, the DRC Provincial Labour Inspector conducts \nan annual inspection to ensure all employees, including those employed as contractors, \nreceive the minimum wage, and comply with DRC labour law.  KCC’s supplier agreements \nare required to contain standard terms and conditions on the requirement for robust health \nand safety management programmes, upholding respect for human rights, the prevention \nof child labour, good working conditions and fair salaries. \n\nSince 2020, KCC has successfully participated in the Responsible Minerals Initiative’s \nprogramme for its Responsible Minerals Assurance Process. Supplier due diligence was a \ncore part of this third-party assessment. The report on this assessment is available on our \nwebsite. \n\n \n \n\f•  Volcan environmental pollution:  \n\nNote Glencore divested its controlling interest in Volcan in May 2024 and the following \ndetails are only applicable to prior to the date of divestment. More than a hundred years of \nmining in the Pasco region have resulted in numerous challenges. Since 2018 and until \ndivestment, Glencore supported Volcan's management team to develop and implement a \nsocial and environmental management plan to help mitigate the environmental impact of \nCerro de Pasco. From the end of 2020 to mid-2021, Glencore appointed an external \nconsultant, ERM, to carry out environmental health and safety and social due diligence of \nCerro de Pasco's operations. \n\nWhile part of the Glencore Group, Volcan was committed to working in partnership with \nregional authorities, national government agencies and representatives of local \ncommunities to address concerns. Volcan established strategic partnerships to identify, \nmonitor address the health impacts of heavy metal exposure in local communities and \nconducted health campaigns, community workshops and awareness sessions on topics \nsuch as personal care and hygiene, healthy eating, and anaemia prevention. It also \nprovided the local community with access to health services, including general medicine, \npaediatrics, gynaecology, ultrasound, physiotherapy, and nutrition. Volcan worked in \npartnership with the Ministry of Health (MINSA) to provide financial support and develop \naction plans for children with high blood lead levels, as well as funding a study to \ninvestigate blood lead levels in populations in the Huayllay and Huaychao communities. \n\nStudies were established to understand the possible sources and pathways of lead and \nother heavy metals. Volcan strengthened its understanding of potential air, soil, and water \nimpacts at the processing plant in Cerro de Pasco through reviewing the monitoring \nnetwork and increasing monitoring frequency, as well as changing practices to reduce lead \ndust within the operation and on surrounding roads. Studies were analysing closure \noptions, including socio-economic and environmental assessments. Monitoring data from \nthe 22 air quality monitoring stations operating at Cerro de Pasco showed that their \nactivities had no material impact on air quality and that their emissions were within \npermissible limits. \n\n•  Kazzinc air pollution: \n\nWe understand that the rally mentioned in this allegation did not specifically reference \nKazzinc. At the time of the rally, Kazzinc did not receive any complaints relating to \nenvironmental issues via its hotline or on social media. Kazzinc undertakes continuous \nmonitoring of its emissions using an automated monitoring system. The data generated is \n\n\fautomatically sent to relevant government agencies. Kazzinc’s approach to managing its \nemissions and its monitoring systems supports compliance with permitted limits. \n\nOn occasions when weather conditions lead to a build-up of emissions from industrial \nfacilities operating in the region, state inspectors, through a memorandum of \nunderstanding with Kazzinc, are granted access to sites without prior authorisation to \nundertake additional monitoring of emission sources. Kazzinc proactively engages with \nstate authorities also in case of general inspections and audits on environmental \nperformance. \n\nAs always, we are happy to discuss further if required. \n\nKind regards,  \n\nPam"}

This movement makes us large TRI contributors. \nHowever, this material is simply moved from one location to another within our mine site as part of \nthe excavation activity that accompanies mining. The largest contributors to our TRI reporting \ninclude movement of overburden material within our property and disposal of tailings which are \nstored in specifically sited, engineered, constructed and permitted facilities on site to prevent \npotential health or environmental impacts.   \n\nWe are committed to responsible mining practices and environmental stewardship and closely \nmonitor operations in compliance with state, federal, and local regulations. We regularly report on \nthe operational performance of our engineered, permitted facilities and check the accuracy of our \ndata internally while seeking independent verification where appropriate. We voluntarily give \ndetailed social and environmental performance data through our annual sustainable development \nreport and climate registry. We also routinely provide environmental data to state and federal \nregulators regarding air, water, and soil quality associated with our operations. \n\nTRI was created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is an annual listing of \ntypes and amounts of chemical substances released into the air, water, and land by specific \nindustries in the U.S. TRI reporting is generally used to help stakeholders learn about toxic \nchemicals and pollution prevention activities and supports informed decision making. Unlike TRI, \nother federal and state laws and regulations are responsible for responding to releases that have \nsignificant impacts on human health and the environment. The shared term ‘release’ between \nthese different regulations may be particularly confusing to those not familiar with the different \nprograms.  \n\nThe TRI reporting requirements apply to certain facilities that manufacture, import, process, or \notherwise use one or more listed chemicals by the EPA. Those chemicals of greatest interest to \nthe mineral processing industry are the categories of metal compounds (which include arsenic, \ncadmium, lead, copper, zinc, and other naturally occurring metals) in the material that is \nexcavated.     \n\nThe dirt and rock moved at the mine have naturally occurring metals, and when we move that dirt \nand rock, we must report that movement. The millions of tons of material we move each year \nmakes us a large TRI contributor. As the dirt is picked up and moved from one location to another, \nfor purposes of TRI reporting, this is considered a “release” under the TRI program (not \nremediation programs implicating significant impacts to human health and the environment), even \nthough the moved material stays on Kennecott property.    \n\nThe largest two contributors to Kennecott’s reporting include the movement of overburden material \nand disposal to tailings. Although this material is being safely stored in specifically sited, \nengineered, constructed, and permitted facilities, the fact that the material is moved still requires \nreporting in TRI.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2 / 2 \n\nKennecott has received publicity due to the large quantities of material it moves which require TRI \nreporting. The nature of the EPA report and the way it has been reported by the news media \nmakes the “releases” appear potentially risky.  Their use of the report implicates the “release” as \nbeing associated with other program requirements, wrongfully suggesting significant impacts to \nhuman health and the environment.  As stated above, the reality is that this material is moved from \none location to another on site and safely stored in specific facilities on site, and is regulated and \npermitted via other federal and state environmental programs.   \n\nENDS \nMARCH 13, 2025"}

Below are our answers to the remaining questions: \n\n1.Concern: Waste disposal without a permit in Bor Copper Mine  \n\nAs a responsible multinational enterprise, we strictly adhere to Serbian laws and regulations and are \ndeeply  committed  to  environmentally  sustainable  operations.  The  waste  management  permit  is \ndirectly related to the Cukaru Peki project operated by our subsidiary Serbia Zijin Mining (SZM). \n\nBefore  the  permit  expired  in  December  2022,  SZM  submitted  a  renewal  application.  In  2023,  the \nMinistry requested supplementary data and documents (relating solely to procedural improvements, \nnot  environmental  deficiencies).  SZM  promptly  complied,  resubmitting  updated  materials.  In \nSeptember  2024,  Ministry  of  Mining  and  Energy  introduced  the  New  Guidelines  for  Submitting \nApplications for Approval of Waste Management Plan (PURO), and SZM adjusted its application to \nalign with these new requirements. The permit is currently under review. \n\nWhile  Serbian  law  does  not  explicitly  define  a  \"transition  period\"  during  permit  applications,  EU \nwaste  management  practices  generally  allow  continued  operations  pending  regulatory  decisions. \nThroughout  this  process,  SZM  has  maintained  close  communication  with  regulators  and  strictly \nadhered  to  the  updated  PURO  (aligned  with  the  latest  EU  and  Serbian  standards).  SZM  has  not \nreceived any directives to halt operations, and both internal and third-party independent assessments \nconfirm no environmental harm has occurred. Delays in the renewal process stem from the lengthy \nregulatory  procedures  and  evolving  policies,  but  SZM  has  consistently  followed  a  compliant \n\"application-amendment-reapplication\" path without intentional violations. \n\nThe  Cukaru  Peki  project  has  been  recognized  as  Serbia’s  first  green  mine.  During  the  transition \nperiod, environmental investments and standards were not reduced but further elevated. The project \nfeatures  the high-standard  built  water-treatment  plant, dumps and tailings  facility  (lined with  high-\nstrength  impermeable  materials),  which  achieve  zero  discharge  of  industrial  wastewater  (100% \nrecycling) and compliant tailings and waste disposal. \n\n2.Concern: Improper health and safety measures for workers of Bor Copper Mine： \n\nThe accident that occurred on February 16, 2024, injured 10 workers and took place at the Cukaru \nPeki shaft construction project, which was contracted and independently managed by CC-3 Mining \nConstruction d.o.o Bor (CC-3). CC-3 is a legally incorporated entity in Serbia with valid licenses and \nbears  direct  responsibility  for  construction  safety.  Immediately  following  the  incident,  CC-3 \nactivated  its  emergency  response  plan,  organized  rescue  efforts,  transported  the  injured  to  medical \nfacilities,  and  issued  a  media  statement  to  publicly  disclose  information.  All  injured  workers  have \nfully recovered. Under Serbian law, the construction contractor, as an independent liability entity, is \nlegally accountable for safety incidents within its operational scope. \n\nWe deeply regret the occurrence of this incident. Zijin Mining Group and its subsidiaries prioritize \nsafety  as the utmost  priority in all operations. SZM has  established a comprehensive  Occupational \nHealth  and  Safety  (OHS)  management  system  covering  all  employees,  certified  under  ISO  45001, \nand implements the \"4E\" and \"Take5\" safety management mechanisms. As the project owner, SZM’s \n\n \n\fconstruction contract with CC-3 explicitly mandates compliance with Serbian safety standards, and \nSZM has fulfilled its  contractual safety oversight  obligations in  full. This  includes conducting 451 \nsafety  inspections  and  issuing  78  rectification  notices  for  underground  construction  projects  in \n2023/2024, all of which have been fully enforced. \n\n3.Concern: Iron pollution as a result of Zijinshan gold and copper mine   \n\nThis  allegation  from  BHRRC  is  not  correct.  The  study  doesn’t  have  a  conclusion  that  the  high \nconcentration of Fe is due to Zijinshan. \n\nThis  research provides  a macro-level  analysis of potential effects  of Chinese mining  operations on \nwater  quality.  The  research  only  illustrate  the  presence  of  mining  activities  in  western  Fujian  and \ncites  the  most  famous  mine  in  the  region,  Zijinshan,  without  establishing  any  direct  causation \nbetween Zijin and the reported water quality issues (namely, pH imbalance and excessive iron levels). \nThere’s  no  additional  information  in  the  study  (e.g.,  detailed  data,  research  methodology)  that \ndefinitively links these water quality issues to Zijin's operations or proves a causal relationship.  \n\nHowever, there are wide range of deposits of metals such as iron, manganese, and rare earth elements, \nas well as non-metallic minerals like kaolin and coal. It is important to highlight that water quality \ndynamics  involve  complex  interactions  among  multiple  factors.  The  study  does  not  account  for \ngeological variables, including potential heavy metal leaching from naturally occurring mineralized \nrock formations inherent to the region. \n\nAs  a  responsible  operator,  Zijin  Mining  places  ecological  stewardship  at  the  core  of  its  corporate \nphilosophy.  At  Zijinshan  Gold-copper  Mine,  we  have  implemented  an  advanced  environmental \nmanagement system integrating technological innovation and systemic restoration: \n\n⚫  Real-Time Monitoring Network: Established automated monitoring stations at all critical points \n\nfor continuous water quality surveillance. \n\n⚫  Biomonitoring: We raise fish downstream of the mining area to serve as an early warning system \n\nfor any leaks or pollution incidents. \n\n⚫  Closed-Loop  Water  Management:  Achieved  100%  wastewater  recycling  through  internal \n\ntreatment systems. \n\n⚫  State-of-the-Art  Treatment  Infrastructure:  Deployed  precision  water  purification  systems  to \n\nensure compliance with discharge standards. \n\n⚫  Ecological  Engineering:  Utilized  constructed  wetlands  for  natural  pollutant  attenuation  and \n\nresource recovery. \n\nThank you once again for your interest and engagement.  \n\nSincerely, \n\nESG Team \n\nZijin Mining Group \n\nNo. 1 Zijin Road, Shanghang County Longyan City, Fujian Province, PRC"}

It \n\nhas never attempted to undermine the EUDR. Concerns regarding the implementation timeline of \n\nthe EUDR were related to the absence of practical tools and guidelines needed to comply with the \n\nRegulation, which subsequently had an impact on the ability of all relevant actors to prepare for its \n\nimplementation. It was not linked to the industry's willingness to comply. \n\nAs Nestlé, we strongly support the objective of the European Commission to protect the world’s \n\nforests and restore forests in a sustainable way. We have consistently advocated for a mix of \n\ncomplementary measures at EU level to address global deforestation in partnership with third \n\ncountries. Our work to achieve deforestation-free key supply chains started over a decade ago. As of \n\nthe end of 2024, 93.5% of the total volume of our key ingredients – cocoa, coffee, meat, palm oil, pulp \n\nand paper, soy and sugar – are assessed as deforestation-free. Our progress has been recognized by the \n\n2024 Forest 500 report in which Nestlé came out as the top FMCG company.  \n\nThanks to our longstanding work in avoiding deforestation, we remain confident in our ability to \n\ncomply with the EUDR.

Nestlé remains supportive of the objectives of the \n\nEUDR and its successful implementation. We will continue to contribute to discussions on the EUDR \n\nimplementation to support the achievement of this objective.  \n\nFor additional reference on our views and commitment to a successful implementation of the \n\nprovisions of the EUDR, please find below several public statements clarifying that we have never \n\nasked for a delay or weakening of the EUDR: \n\n•  Reuters article on letter from Cocoa Coalition to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen \n\n(July 2024)  \n\n•  LinkedIn Post from Bart Vandewaetere, Vice-President ESG Engagement Nestlé Europe “EU \n\nDeforestation Regulation: a delay without urgent clarifications won’t help!” (September 2024)  \n\n•  Statement of NGOs and companies opposing calls to reopen the substance of the EUDR, and \n\nurging immediate release of guidance documents and FAQ (October 2024) \n\n\f•  Cocoa Coalition Statement, opposing reopening EUDR (October 2024)  \n\n•  Financial Times article with quote from Bart Vandewaetere, Vice-President ESG Engagement \n\nNestlé Europe (November 2024) \n\n•  Wall Street Journal article with quote from Bart Vandewaetere, Vice-President ESG \n\nEngagement Nestlé Europe (November 2024)  \n\n•  LinkedIn post from Bart Vandewaetere, Vice-President ESG Engagement Nestlé Europe “EU \nDeforestation Regulation: Adopt the 12-month delay without reopening the law!” (November \n\n2024)"}

We deeply  respect  the history, resilience,  and challenges of the \nMaasai  people.  Our  involvement  in  the  Longido  and  Monduli  Rangelands  Carbon  Project \n(LMRCP),  implemented  by  our  project  partners  Soils  for  the  Future  Tanzania  (SftFTZ,  the \nproject implementing entity) and CarbonSolve LLC, is grounded in a commitment to improving \nrangeland  health,  supporting  Maasai  livelihoods,  and  promoting  climate  resilience  through \ncarbon  finance.  The  project  is  designed  to  balance  traditional  pastoralist  land  use  with \nsustainable  land  management  while  ensuring  that  Maasai  communities  retain  full  control  over \ntheir land and benefit from participation. \nIn  the  following  section,  we  would  like  to  clarify  several  key  points  in  response  to  the  claims \nmade in the MISA report: \n1. Land Ownership and Rights \n\n  SftFTZ does not acquire or control any land within the project area. All land titles remain \nentirely under the ownership of the Maasai villages, in accordance with Tanzanian law. \n  The  project  does  not  involve  land  sales,  leases,  encumbrances  or  transfers  to  foreign \n\nentities. \n\n  Maasai  communities  will  continue  to  exercise  full  rights  over  their  land  and  maintain \n\ntheir traditional grazing practices. \n\n2. Contract Duration and Flexibility \n\n  There is a scientific consensus that soil restoration takes time. The 40-year duration of the \nproject contracts is needed to support the reality that degraded grasslands, such as those \nin Northern Tanzania, can take several decades to recover. \n\n  This  long-term  commitment  ensures  sustainable  land  regeneration  and  stable  economic \nbenefits for communities. Importantly, contracts include exit clauses, allowing villages to \nreview, renegotiate, or withdraw from the agreement where they choose to do so… \n\n3. Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) Process \n\n  Volkswagen  ClimatePartner  places  a  strong  emphasis  on  FPIC,  ensuring  that  all \nparticipating communities fully understand the project’s terms, benefits, and implications. \n  The FPIC process begins with an early engagement to introduce the project, explain its \nbroad  concepts  and  its  progression  from  introduction  to  implementation.  This  process \nincludes,  initially,  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MoU)  and  results  in  the  two \nproject  agreements,  namely  the  Carbon  Rights  Assignment  Agreement  and  the  Benefit \nSharing Agreement. \n\n  Engagement  includes  women,  youth,  and  village  elders,  with  all  agreements  requiring \n\nfinal approval from the village assembly before implementation. \n\n  Dedicated  Maasai  team  members  within  SftFTZ  lead  consultations  to  ensure  cultural \n\nsensitivity, inclusivity, and transparency. \n\n  An  independent  data  management  consultancy  tracks  all  FPIC-related  activities  to \n\ndocument engagement and ensure full transparency. \n\n4. Pastoralist Traditions and Grazing Practices \n\n  The project is not designed to restrict Maasai traditions but rather to support sustainable \n\npastoralism by preventing overgrazing and land degradation. \n\n  The  project  does  not  disrupt  traditional  grazing  but  rather  supports  it  with  financial \nbenefits, ensuring its sustainability while focusing specifically on preventing overgrazing. \n\n\f  The  project  ensures  flexible  yet  secure  governance  of  grazing  activities.  While  villages \ncommit  to  core  grazing  principles,  each  village  grazing  committee  designs  a  specific \nmanagement plan that is agreed upon by participants. This plan can be adjusted over time \nto respond to changing conditions, emergencies, and community needs. \n\n5. Fair Benefit-Sharing Mechanism and Initial Project Payments \n\n  The  project  follows  the  Tanzanian  legal  framework  on  carbon  trading,  ensuring  that \n\nrevenues are distributed fairly among stakeholders. \n\n  Benefit  sharing  is  guided  by  the  Tanzanian  legal  framework  as  further  negotiated \n\n \n\nbetween the villages and SftFTZ with oversight from the district. \nInitial project payments are used to support project preparation. The payments are made \nafter  the  Benefit  Sharing  Agreements  have  been  signed  and  after  the  Rapid  Rotational \nGrazing Plans have been developed. \n\n6. Scientific Basis and Environmental Impact \n\n  There is a broad consensus among the scientific community and global institutions, such \nas  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  that  tackling  soil  and  land \ndegradation—including  soil  carbon  enhancements—is  vital  for  combating  climate \nchange. Carbon crediting serves as an additional tool to achieve these impacts. \n\n  The  project  methodology  applies  a  peer-reviewed  soil  carbon  model,  which  has  been \napproved by VERRA for use in relevant contexts, including arid and semi-arid regions of \nEast Africa. \n\n  The methodology requires ex-post soil sampling to determine the actual accumulation of \n\nsoil carbon over time to avoid over-crediting. \n\nVolkswagen  ClimatePartner  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  our  climate  initiatives  respect  land \nrights,  promote  sustainable  development,  and  create  real  benefits  for  communities.  We  are \ncommitted  to  ongoing  engagement  with  Maasai  communities,  independent  experts,  and \nregulatory bodies. \n\nFor further inquiries, please contact: \nVolkswagen ClimatePartner \ncommunications@volkswagen-climatepartner.de"}

The opening of an investigation has been confirmed by the Attorney General’s \nOffice of Mozambique early March 2025. \n\nIn addition, TotalEnergies has requested the intervention of the Mozambican Commission on Human \nrights (CNDH). The CNDH confirmed on 25 March 2025 that it will carry out its own assessment of all \nrelevant information to ensure that the facts are duly ascertained and that the rights of the parties \ninvolved  are  fully  respected.  It  has  stated  that  it  will  follow  the  investigation  launched  by  the \nMozambican  judicial authorities  to  ensure that it is  conducted  in a transparent, fair and impartial \nmanner. TotalEnergies will publish the CNDH report. \n\nIn addition to the above information, please also find here below the links to the documents already \nmade publicly available by Mozambique LNG and TotalEnergies: \n\nMozambique 2024-11-26 \n\nInvestigations-performed-by-Mozambique-LNG-on-the-allegations-published-by-Politico.pdf \n\nMozambique 2024-09-26 \n\nMozambique  LNG:  TotalEnergies  welcomes  the  launch  of  official  investigations  in  Mozambique  | \nTotalEnergies.com \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWith regard to the allegations of “communities of Afungi affected by unresolved resettlement \nviolations resorted to protest at the gates of the TotalEnergies Afungi site in November; as of 17 \nJanuary, community members have expressed dissatisfaction with the compensation offered \nby TotalEnergies”, please note the following: \n\n(A) Resettlement context \n\nIn addition to rights to develop the resources, the LNG project concessionaires (Area 1 and Area 4), \nhave been granted rights on land use by the Government of Mozambique over an area of circa 6,000 \nhectares in the Afungi peninsula covered by the DUAT (DUAT = land rights granted by the authorities \nfor the onshore operations of the projects). \nA Resettlement Plan complying with national legislation and international standards was approved \nby  the  Palma  district  Government  in  2017  to  manage  the  economic  displacement  of  1,680 \nhouseholds and the physical relocation of 643 households from the Quitupo village and neighboring \nproduction  zones  to  a  newly  built  Quitunda  village.  In  addition,  1,879  fishermen  and  intertidal \ncollectors (mostly women who harvest coastal resources) were identified along with fisheries. \nThe suspension of all activities (due to Force Majeure in April 2021) in Afungi came at a time when \nthe Project was part way through the Resettlement Plan implementation. From the second half of \n2022, the improvement of the security context in Palma allowed for the resumption of resettlement-\nrelated activities, socio-economic programs, and face-to-face engagements with the communities, \ndespite Force Majeure still being in effect. \n\n(B) Compensation \n\nAll 643 entitled households physically relocated have received their due compensation and their new \nhomes in the Quitunda village, with the last group of families relocated in May 2024. \n\nThe status of compensation payment as of 1 January 2025 is as follows: \n\n✓  All of the 1,680 land-based economically impacted households have been paid their entitled \n\nmonetary compensation. \n\n✓  Fisheries compensation has been paid to 1,386 fishermen and intertidal collectors (mostly \n\nwomen who harvest coastal resources) and remaining ongoing. \n\nThe  Project  continues  to  actively  work  on  the  Resettlement  process  in  order  to  reach  100%  of \nimpacted  stakeholders  and  notes  that,  from  its  perspective,  the  Resettlement  process  is  well \nunderway and ahead of schedule considering the two-year delay on the implementation of the RAP \n(Resettlement Action Plan) caused by the Force Majeure situation affecting the Project. \n\nProject’s Community Grievance Mechanism \n\nThe  Project  maintains  a  non-judicial  Community  Grievance  Mechanism  which  follows  the \ninternational  standards  (IFC  grievance  management  process,  and  the  United  Nations  Guiding \nPrinciples for Business and Human Rights) and is readily available to households and communities \n\n \n \n\fthrough  several  channels,  and  is  conducted  on  fair,  informed,  and  respectful  terms  (respect  for \nconfidentiality to prevent the possible risk of reprisals). \n\nSince the creation of the Project’s Community Grievance Mechanism, the Project has investigated \nover 600 compensation-related grievances received and 386 were found to be legitimate. Of these, \n351 have already signed compensation agreements for which payments are being processed. \n\nNovember 2024 Demonstrations \n\nWe would like to clarify that the November 2024 demonstrations only involved a small number of so-\ncalled  «Newcomers”  who  participated  in  the  demonstrations.  The  members  of  the  Resettled \ncommunity  (i.e.  those  who  have  moved  to  a  new  house  in  the  Quitunda  village)  and  of  the \nEconomically affected community (i.e. those who did not have to move to a new house but who were \ncompensated for the loss of an economic (farming) interest within the DUAT), did not participate in \nthe demonstrations. \n\nEconomically  affected  community  members  were  entitled  to  cash  compensation,  which  they \nreceived, and access to new land outside of the DUAT area, as part of the livelihood restoration plan, \nin an area reserved by the Government for this intent. The land designated for this purpose was no \nlonger available as a result of the influx of vulnerable people (the “newcomers’ community”) moving \ninto  those  lands.  The  Government,  the  Project  and  the  economic  community  are  looking  for \nalternative  means  to  fulfil  the  livelihood  restoration  plan  –  this  work  is  ongoing  and  remains \nconstructive. \n\nAs far as the Newcomers community members are concerned, given that they will not be asked to \nleave the land on which they have recently settled, the Project has informed this community that \ncompensation  would  not  be  provided.  Upon  hearing  this,  about  50  out  of  a  total  of  2,000  of  the \n“newcomers’  community”  demonstrated  outside  of  the  gate  to  the  DUAT  area.  An  assistance \npackage  to  this  group  was  agreed  at  the  end  of  2024  and  its  implementation  is  ongoing.  This \nassistance  package  include  a  one-off  payment  including  labour  cost  for  land  preparation,  the \nopportunity to participate with their land in the agricultural development program implemented by \nthe Project, which includes: (i) support for food production through the provision of improved seeds \nand  technical  assistance  and  (ii)  an  income  generating  coconut  plantation,  (iii)  Government \ncommitting to provide security of tenure; and (iv) the implementation, in mid-term, of community \nsocio-economic benefits through the formalization of community development agreements with the \nhost communities and the Government. \n\n__________"}

TotalEnergies implements its integrated, balanced multi-energy strategy based on two pillars: hydrocarbons, particularly Liquified Natural Gas, and electricity, the energy at the heart of the transition. Firstly, TotalEnergies has not engaged in lobbying activities aimed at delaying and/or weakening South Africa’s carbon tax and climate legislation.   Regarding our advocacy and sector initiatives, please note that TotalEnergies supports the commitments made by governments to combat global warming as part of the Paris Agreement and publishes its positions on its corporate website1.   TotalEnergies is an active participant in both national and international business and industry associations.

TotalEnergies Marketing South Africa (Pty) Ltd is a member of the Energy Council of South Africa (ECSA). The ECSA is an industry association which supports South Africa’s commitments adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Paris Agreement and South Africa’s climate change legislation aimed at achieving Net Zero by 2050. Furthermore, the ECSA further recognises the critical importance of a successful national energy transition in meeting the decarbonisation targets whilst maintaining energy security.   TotalEnergies’ report regarding the review of industry associations was published in 2024 and can be found on its corporate website3. Every two years, TotalEnergies’ entities record memberships in industry associations. 1107 industry associations (including the ECSA) and chambers of commerce have been covered for 2023 and for which the list is available on its corporate website4.  Regarding the specific allegations in the report of Just Share, we invite you to contact the ECSA, which is better positioned to provide detailed information concerning its activities.

We hereby formally respond to your emailed requests dated 28 May 2025 relating to the 2025 MACUA & WAMUA report titled \"Looted Promises: The Crumbs Economy of Mining and the Myth of the Just Transition” which specifically referenced Glencore’s Waterval Mine and the mining-affected community.   1. How does your company respond to the report’s allegations that you underdelivered on the legally binding obligations in your Social Labour Plans (“SLP’s”).  We considered the content of the MACUA Report and confirms that the report contains several inaccuracies.    In relation to the Waterval Mine SLPs, over the first SLP period 2010 - 2014 period Glencore actually spent more than double the committed SLP amount and the 2nd cycle SLP from 2016-2020 was completed in full as committed to. SLP Closure reports for the above 2 SLP periods as well as final closure and Section 93 reports have been submitted to the DMPR. The 3rd SLP cycle from 2021-2025 is currently being finalized.  The legally binding obligations in our SLPs have thus been met and even exceeded.  The report falsely alleges that Glencore does not engage on matters related to SLP’s and that it is unwilling to share its SLP’s in the public domain. Our rigorous stakeholder engagements are well documented and covers community, local municipality and engagements with the Regulator. MACUA received copies of the requested SLP within a week of submitting the request. Copies of the SLP are available at the operations and is also published on the Minerals Councils website.  \f    Page 2  2. Can you provide updated figures or independent verification on the completion and impact of your SLP projects in the area?  The DMPR as the Regulator has conducted compliance audits and has completed the closure and verification reports for the Waterval Mine SLPs for the 1st and 2nd cycle SLPs.   1st SLP:   2nd SLP:     Current 3rd SLP (still busy implementing): \f    Page 3    3. Has your company made its full SLP documents, budgets, and implementation reports publicly available or accessible to the affected communities? Are they available online? If yes, please provide the link.   Upon receiving a request from MACUA, Glencore shared its SLP with them on the 15th of November 2021. Glencore has made its approved SLP’s readily available on many platforms including the website of the Minerals Council of South Africa.   https://www.mineralscouncil.org.za/sa-mining/slps/slps-by-province  The regulation requiring the publication of approved SLPs (Regulation 46A of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Regulations) came into effect in 2020. This regulation mandates that mining right holders must publish the approved SLP in English and one other dominant official language within the mine community within 30 days of approval. Glencore’s latest approved SLPs are publicly available at the operations, the local municipalities and on the Minerals Council website.  4. What strategies did your company use to engage the local community, particularly women and youth, in the planning and implementation of the SLP? We extensively mapped our doorstep communities. The analysis from our detailed independent community baseline studies conducted by Rasegoete & Associates, Social Surveys Community Stability Project and Synergy Global Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights following our human rights risks and impact, as well as community health assessments conducted in communities provide a concise and first-hand needs assessment. This informs our planning and implementation strategies.  Glencore engages regularly with a broad base of stakeholders including youth and women through our community engagement structures. Glencore places high value on stakeholder engagement, free prior and informed consent and ensures that all relevant stakeholders are continually engaged to ensure the sustainability of our operations and the communities we operate in.   Our quarterly Mayoral Stakeholder Committee meetings provide progress on SLP implementation, local enterprise and supplier development and general corporate social responsibility initiatives.    \f    Page 4  Yours sincerely, Glencore Operations South Africa Pty Ltd    Conroy van der Westhuizen Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer"}

How nickel mining threatens the future \nof one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots”. \n\nFor Mercedes-Benz, social and environmental responsibility are the pillars of responsible corporate \ngovernance and key factors for our long-term success. We are working to ensure that our products only \ncontain raw materials and other materials that were obtained and produced without violating human rights \nand environmental standards.  \n\nOn account of the complexity of the supply chain and the variety of raw materials and other materials in our \nproducts, Mercedes-Benz takes a risk-based and strategic approach. To this end, we have developed a due \ndiligence approach in the form of the Mercedes-Benz Human Rights Respect System. \n\nWe use a variety of measures and concepts for the management of our supply chain. We work closely with \nour direct suppliers and oblige them to comply with our Responsible Sourcing Standards (RSS), to integrate \nthem into their upstream value chains and to monitor compliance with them. .Further information with regards \nto measures taken can be found on our website and the Mercedes-Benz Sustainability Report.  \n\nNickel is one of the 24 raw materials that Mercedes-Benz has classified as critical, for which we carried out a \nrisk-orientated raw material assessment based on the logic and methodology of the UN Guiding Principles for \nBusiness and Human Rights (UNGPs). The aim is to identify and mitigate risks in our raw material supply \nchains. Specific information on the methodology aligned with the UNGP can be found on our website. The \nresults can be found in the Mercedes-Benz Raw Material Report – page 122. \n\nThe assessment essentially consists of three steps: \n1. Increasing transparency along raw material supply chains – especially with regard to certain key \ncomponents such as battery cells. To this end, Mercedes-Benz, for example, contacts the suppliers of the \nrelevant components and asks them to disclose their deeper supply chain. \n2. Identification of risk hotspots in these supply chains, e.g. based on the specific risks in the individual \nmining countries. \n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG | Mercedesstraße 120, 70372 Stuttgart | T +49 711 17 0 | F +49 711 17 2 22 44 | dialog@mercedes-benz.com  \ngroup.mercedes-benz.com  \n\nSitz und Registergericht: Stuttgart, HRB-Nr.19360 | Vorsitzender des Aufsichtsrats: Bernd Pischetsrieder \nVorstand: Ola Källenius, Vorsitzender; Jörg Burzer, Renata Jungo Brüngger, Sabine Kohleisen, Markus Schäfer, Britta Seeger, \nHubertus Troska, Harald Wilhelm  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3. Defining and implementing measures for the risk hotspots and review their long-term effectiveness. \n\nBased on our raw material assessment, we address environmental and human rights risks in our supply chain \nand follow them up. This includes regular dialogues with our suppliers and on-site assessments. Our clear \ngoal is to make supply chains more transparent, to enable close cooperation as well as to improve a common \nunderstanding of local conditions. This enables us to better identify human rights and environmental risks and \ncounteract them in cooperation with our suppliers. \n\nWe currently don’t source Nickel directly. However, we map our Nickel supply chains in great detail in an \nongoing process, as they are dynamic and very complex with many tier stages. Following our approach of \nempowerment before withdrawal, we see the strong need for a collaborative effort to mitigate against \nadverse impacts of nickel mining and processing on human rights and the environment.   \n\nThat is why we are currently in contact with other OEMs to form alliances for effective measures to protect \nhuman rights in the production of nickel in Indonesia in the long term. The aim is to work together on concrete \nsolutions for the local people.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nSocial Compliance \n\n2"}

Our involvement \nin the Longido and Monduli Rangelands Carbon Project (LMRCP), implemented by our project \npartners  Soils  for  the  Future  Tanzania  (SftFTZ,  the  project  implementing  entity)  and \nCarbonSolve  LLC,  is  grounded  in  a  commitment  to  improving  rangeland  health,  supporting \nMaasai  livelihoods,  and  promoting  climate  resilience  through  carbon  finance.  The  project  is \ndesigned  to  balance  traditional  pastoralist  land  use  with  sustainable  land  management  while \nensuring  that  Maasai  communities  retain  full  control  over  their  land  and  benefit  from \nparticipation. \nIn  the  following  section,  we  would  like  to  clarify  several  key  points  in  response  to  the  claims \nmade in the MISA report: \n1. Land Ownership and Rights \n\n  SftFTZ does not acquire or control any land within the project area. All land titles remain \nentirely under the ownership of the Maasai villages, in accordance with Tanzanian law. \n  The project  does not  involve land sales, leases, encumbrances or transfers to  foreign or \n\nTanzanian entities or individuals. \n\n  Maasai  communities  will  continue  to  exercise  full  rights  over  their  land  and  maintain \n\ntheir traditional grazing practices. \n\n2. Contract Duration and Flexibility \n\n  There is a scientific consensus that soil restoration takes time. The 40-year duration of the \nproject contracts is needed to support the reality that degraded grasslands, such as those \nin Northern Tanzania, can take several decades to recover. \n\n  This  long-term  commitment  ensures  sustainable  land  regeneration  and  stable  economic \nbenefits  for  communities.  The  project  agreements  can  be  reviewed  to  reflect  on \nexperience with implementation. If one side does not meet its core obligations, the other \nside has the right to terminate the agreement through a defined process. \n\n3. Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) Process \n\n  Volkswagen  ClimatePartner  places  a  strong  emphasis  on  FPIC,  ensuring  that  all \nparticipating communities fully understand the project’s terms, benefits, and implications. \n  The FPIC process begins with an early engagement to introduce the project, explain its \nbroad  concepts  and  its  progression  from  introduction  to  implementation.  This  process \nincludes,  initially,  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MoU)  and  results  in  the  two \nproject  agreements,  namely  the  Carbon  Rights  Assignment  Agreement  and  the  Benefit \nSharing Agreement. \n\n  Engagement  includes  women,  youth,  and  village  elders,  with  all  agreements  requiring \n\nfinal approval from the village assembly before implementation. \n\n  Dedicated  Maasai  team  members  within  SftFTZ  lead  consultations  to  ensure  cultural \n\nsensitivity, inclusivity, and transparency. \n\n  An  independent  data  management  consultancy  tracks  all  FPIC-related  activities  to \n\ndocument engagement and ensure full transparency. \n\n4. Pastoralist Traditions and Grazing Practices \n\n  The project is not designed to restrict Maasai traditions but rather to support sustainable \n\npastoralism by preventing overgrazing and land degradation. \n\n  The  project  does  not  disrupt  traditional  grazing  but  rather  supports  it  with  financial \nbenefits, ensuring its sustainability while focusing specifically on preventing overgrazing. \n\n\fVolkswagen ClimatePartner response to a report published by the Maasai International \nSolidarity Alliance \n\n  The  project  ensures  flexible  yet  secure  governance  of  grazing  activities.  While  villages \ncommit  to  core  grazing  principles,  each  village  grazing  committee  designs  a  specific \nmanagement plan that is agreed upon by participants. This plan can be adjusted over time \nto respond to changing conditions, emergencies, and community needs. \n\n5. Fair Benefit-Sharing Mechanism and Initial Project Payments \n\n  The  project  follows  the  Tanzanian  legal  framework  on  carbon  trading,  ensuring  that \n\nrevenues are distributed fairly among stakeholders. \n\n  Benefit  sharing  is  guided  by  the  Tanzanian  legal  framework  as  further  negotiated \n\n \n\nbetween the villages and SftFTZ with oversight from the district. \nInitial project payments are used to support project preparation. The payments are made \nafter  the  Benefit  Sharing  Agreements  have  been  signed  and  after  the  Rapid  Rotational \nGrazing Plans have been developed. \n\n6. Scientific Basis and Environmental Impact \n\n  There is a broad consensus among the scientific community and global institutions, such \nas  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  that  tackling  soil  and  land \ndegradation—including  soil  carbon  enhancements—is  vital  for  combating  climate \nchange. Carbon crediting serves as an additional tool to achieve these impacts. \n\n  The  project  methodology  applies  a  peer-reviewed  soil  carbon  model,  which  has  been \napproved by VERRA for use in relevant contexts, including arid and semi-arid regions of \nEast Africa. \n\n  The methodology requires ex-post soil sampling to determine the actual accumulation of \n\nsoil carbon over time to avoid over-crediting. \n\nVolkswagen  ClimatePartner  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  our  climate  initiatives  respect  land \nrights,  promote  sustainable  development,  and  create  real  benefits  for  communities.  We  are \ncommitted  to  ongoing  engagement  with  Maasai  communities,  independent  experts,  and \nregulatory bodies. \n\nFor further inquiries, please contact: \nVolkswagen ClimatePartner \ncommunications@volkswagen-climatepartner.de"}

Commus takes these reports extremely \nseriously and immediately launched a thorough verification. Our investigation shows that the \ncontent of these reports is seriously inconsistent with the facts. We hereby clarify as follows: \n\nCommus offers competitive remuneration that exceeds the local industry average. We maintain \na fair and transparent salary-review mechanism and provide comprehensive medical coverage. \nSince 2024 we have significantly increased education subsidies for employees’ children, further \nenhancing family welfare.   \n\nCommus is committed to safeguarding fundamental labour rights. We fully respect employees’ \nlegal right to form and join trade unions voluntarily, and we engage in constructive dialogue \nwith  both  internal  and  external  unions. A  consultative  meeting  with  elected  internal  union \nrepresentatives is held on the last Saturday of every month. A joint quarterly meeting with all \ninternal and external unions reviews key labour-relations issues and tracks the implementation \nof agreed improvements. Employees are encouraged to participate in union activities, fostering \na culture of solidarity and shared progress. On 1 May 2025 Commus and the unions jointly \ncelebrated  International  Workers’  Day,  strengthening  employees’  sense  of  belonging  and \ncohesion. Guided by the principle “Life first, safety always,”   \n\nCommus strictly complies with national laws and continuously strengthens health and safety \nmanagement.  All  employees  receive  and  are  required  to  use  standard-compliant  personal \nprotective equipment; the rule is “No PPE, no work.” Mandatory safety-training programmes \nensure workers understand operational risks, safe practices and emergency procedures, building \nboth awareness and risk-control capacity.   \n\n“Joint development and shared prosperity” remain our core values. We will continue to protect \nemployees’ fundamental rights and maintain open, constructive dialogue with governments and \nall stakeholders to advance sustainable development for both the company and society."}

At Nestlé, we share your \nambition to advance and improve human rights across our value chain.  \n\nPeople and respect for human rights are at the heart of our culture and values and one of \nour Corporate Business Principles. We are committed to upholding human rights across \nour operations and supply chain, and our Human Rights Framework and Roadmap guides \nus in our due diligence approach - assessing, addressing, and reporting transparently on \nactual  and  potential  human  rights  risks.  At  Nestlé,  we  apply  stringent  due  diligence \nprocesses throughout our value chain, and our direct suppliers must fully comply with all \nlocal  laws,  international  standards,  and  applicable  regulations,  and  adhere  to  our \nResponsible Sourcing Core Requirements. \n\nIn February 2023, we published dedicated action plans to help us enhance human rights \ndue diligence across our value chain and in priority countries where we operate and/or \nsource from. We report on this area of our work in our Creating Shared Value report and \nNon-Financial Statement, published annually on our website.  \n\nWe recognize the deep systemic problems in the palm oil sector and are committed to \nworking with all stakeholders to help ensure the palm oil we buy is responsibly sourced. \nSince 2021, we have implemented a specific Palm Oil Human Rights Action Plan with our \ndirect suppliers and NGOs to help us better assess, address and publicly report on labor \nrights risks in our palm oil supply chain. Last year, we furthered this work by rolling out \nHuman  Rights  Action  Plans  nationwide  in  Malaysia,  Indonesia  and  Colombia.  These \nnational-level plans enable us to identify and understand the most salient human rights \nrisks  in  specific  palm  oil  production  areas,  in  turn  informing  any  actions  that  may  be \nneeded.  These  actions  are  both  at  a  direct  supplier-level  and  beyond  (i.e.,  further \nupstream in our supply chain), through collaborative activity at national level (for example \nlandscape or sectoral initiatives).  \n\nFor the last six years, Nestlé has supported palm oil supplier SD Guthrie (formerly Sime \nDarby)  with  funding  for  Suara  Kami,  an  independent  grievance  mechanism  helpline \nadministered and socialized by LRQA. SD Guthrie employees can report grievances to \nSuara  Kami  through  the  hotline  phone  number,  WhatsApp,  and  Facebook  Messenger. \nLRQA staffs Suara Kami with operators who log workers’ grievances in eight languages \n(Bahasa  Indonesian,  Bengali,  Burmese,  English,  Hindi,  Malay,  Nepalese,  and  Tamil), \ncategorizing the grievances by site, type of grievance, and risk level. LRQA coordinates \nanonymized  grievance  response  with  a  dedicated  team  at  Suara  Kami  and  provides \nNestlé with reports on the status of the grievances. The successes of this independent \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fgrievance mechanism are replicable and—as of 2023— LRQA has rolled out Suara Kami \nto  other  palm  oil  companies  including  FGV  and  began  implementing  with  a  glove \nmanufacturer in Malaysia.   \n\nRegarding Malaysia specifically, we conducted a human rights risk assessment and root \ncause analysis to identify priority issues to be addressed through  the 2025-28 Human \nRights  Action  Plan  in  Sabah,  Sarawak  and  on  the  Malaysian  peninsula.  In  Sabah,  our \nfocus remains on addressing child labor risk, a systemic issue with multiple root causes \nthat requires us to look into local wages and working conditions. We also work with our \ndirect suppliers to continuously improve sustainability practices in our upstream supply \nchain. This helps inform the development of action plans with clear deadlines to act upon \nsalient risks and identify opportunities for improvement. \n\nIn addition to the above actions, Nestlé Malaysia has also entered into a partnership with \nthe  Malaysian  Sustainable  Palm  Oil  (MSPO)  Certification  Scheme.  The  MoU  sets  the \nstage  for  technical  knowledge  exchange,  capacity-building  initiatives,  and  efforts  to \nimprove  traceability  and  smallholder  certification  readiness.  Initial  areas  of  focus  will \ninclude supply chain mapping and training support — laying the groundwork for broader \nalignment  with  global  sustainability  requirements,  including  the  EU  Deforestation \nRegulation (EUDR).  \n\nThe  MoU  also  serves  as  a  precursor  to  the  MSPO  Impact  Alliance  —  a  new  multi-\nstakeholder  platform  designed  to  explore  and  test  innovative  models  that  extend  the \nvalue of certification. Through collaboration with NGOs, financiers, technology partners, \nand multinational FMCG companies, the Alliance will enable MSPO to pilot ideas such \nas green financing for certified producers, digitised traceability solutions, deforestation \nmonitoring tools, and inclusive sourcing incentives for smallholders. Nestlé Malaysia will \njoin  as  a  founding  member,  contributing  to  shared  learning  and  collaborative \nimplementation that will inform MSPO’s next phase of impact. \n\nWith respect to human rights and environmental due diligence (HREDD), Nestlé, together \nwith our technical partner, Proforest, engages priority Tier 1 palm oil suppliers (covering \n80% of our palm oil volumes) to ensure they have adequate HREDD systems in place and \nto  support  them  in  their  continuous  improvement  journey.  The  first  steps  of  the \nengagement process involve assessing suppliers’ HREDD maturity level, followed by the \ndevelopment of scorecards with recommendations for improvement. Suppliers are then \nexpected to develop action plans to address identified gaps while being supported with \nguidance  and  capacity-building.  Their  progress  is  monitored  and  annually  reported  to \nensure continuous improvement. We are also working with key suppliers on action plans \nfor  prioritized  origin  refineries  to  effectively  address  risks  and  issues  at  the  origin \nlevel. This includes our most important direct suppliers for Sabah. \n\nWe  work  with  the  non-profit  organization,  Winrock  International,  that  manages  the \nNestlé Human Rights Fund. Through the Fund, Nestlé provides targeted co-funding to our \ndirect palm oil suppliers through human rights grants to implement specific projects in \nSoutheast Asia, West Africa, and  Latin America. A cornerstone of the Fund is supplier \nsupport through the Earthworm Foundation’s Labour Transformation Programme (LTP). \nThe  LTP  is  an  on-site  engagement  effort  with  mills  and  plantations  in  the  Nestlé  palm \nsupply  chain  to  identify  and  address  potential  human  rights  risks.  The  Earthworm \n\n\fFoundation conducts extensive document reviews and interviews with management and \nworkers  to  measure  compliance  with  local,  national,  and  international  human  rights \nstandards and laws, including those concerning:  \n\n•  Wages and time management (wage amount and deductions, wage transparency \nand pay slip management, and working hours, overtime and rest management)  \n•  Accommodation (location, structure and size, and equipment and safety features)  \n•  Health and safety  \n•  Grievance Management \n•  Employment contract \n•  Freedom  of  movement  (access  to  identity  documents  to  facilitate  workers \n\nmovement outside the mill and plantation) \n\nEach mill and plantation receive a personalized action plan and resources to remedy any \npotential human rights risks, which the Earthworm Foundation monitor and discuss the \nprogress made during follow-up visits.  \n\nFinally, since the publication of the report, representatives from Nestlé HQ and Nestlé \nMalaysia have visited suppliers in Sabah to get a first-hand understanding of the situation \non-ground. They also met with representatives of human rights organizations to find ways \nto address the structural issues identified in the report.  \n\nThanks  again  for  reaching  out  to  us,  and  for  requesting  our  feedback  on  the  Migran \nBerdaulat report. These are critical and challenging issues requiring broad-based, multi-\nstakeholder solutions. We hope that we can work together to chart a path forward that \nhelps improve livelihoods in Sabah, Malaysia."}

We \nknow  that  some entities in our extended  supply chain for electric vehicle production  are  sourcing nickel from \nIndonesia.  As part  of our focus on human  rights, our measures  align with the  recommendations  cited in the \nCRI report. \n\n• \n\nLeverage  buying power  to pressure  mines and/or  suppliers to change  practices  that  cause severe \ndamage  to the climate system and  environmental  or human  rights harm,  and if necessary, stop \nsourcing nickel from producers  engaged  in human  rights and environmental  violations.  \n\nWe work to inform our decisions with transparent  due  diligence and supply chain mapping.  Our due diligence \nframework  is anchored  in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises,  the UN Guiding Principles on \nBusiness and  Human Rights, and ILO core conventions,  to verify ethical practices  and identify risks \nproactively. \n\nAlso, when reasonably  possible, we engage  in vertical integration  and direct  sourcing of critical raw  materials \n(e.g., lithium, nickel, cobalt) to promote  greater  visibility, transparency,  and alignment  with sustainability \nprinciples throughout  our supply chain. We conduct  country and supplier-level  ESG risk assessments, \ndrawing  from reputable  external  sources—including  CAHRAs, the World Bank, and the Heidelberg  Report—\nto evaluate  environmental,  social, and governance  exposures. \n\nIf  material  ESG  gaps  in  the  supply  chain  are  identified  and  not  adequately  addressed  through  corrective \naction,  we  will  take  appropriate  measures,  including  potential  termination  of  business  relationships with our \nimmediate  suppliers  and/or  other  measures  designed  to  apply  legitimate  leverage on the supply chain actors. \nThis  strategy  promotes  responsible  development  of  upstream  industries  and  fosters  long-term  partnerships \nthat  reflect  our  shared  commitment  to  sustainability.  We  value  working  with  partners  who  share  our \ncommitment  to responsible  sourcing and uphold  the principles that  guide us. \n\n• \n\nLeverage  buying power  to pressure  mines and/or  suppliers to provide publicly available information \non water  and air quality in the areas  surrounding  their operations,  as well as an accurate  account  of \ngreenhouse  gas emissions resulting  from the use of coal to power  IWIP operations.  \n\nStellantis’  Global Responsible Purchasing  Guidelines (GRPG) detail our overall supplier expectations  in \nrelation  to human  rights. Stellantis  seeks increased  transparency  regarding  Environmental,  Social and \nGovernance  topics from our value chain  because  we recognize  and respect  the fundamental  human  right to \nclean air, clean water  and environmental  preservation.  To underline  these  expectations  our  contracted/Tier  1 \nsuppliers are asked  to sign the  GRPG to confirm their  commitment. Our Environment  and Energy \ncommitments  establish the framework  for setting  internal  objectives  and targets,  that  seek to minimize the \nenvironmental  impact of our business on current  and future  generations,  communities  and resources.  \n\n•  Require  direct  suppliers to disclose their full list of suppliers, as well as documentation  that  direct \nsuppliers are implementing  EV company policies on human  rights, environmental  and climate due \ndiligence with their  suppliers, and  make that  information  about EV supply chains publicly available \nand accessible. \n\nWe do require  specific targeted  commodities to provide us details of their supplier  list, e.g., conflict minerals \nsmelter and/or  refiner  lists, but obtaining  such information  is often challenging  for legal and  practical \nreasons.  For similar reasons we do not publicly disclose the identities of the  individual supplier  information \nwe are able to obtain.  We do, however, provide  aggregated  data  and performance  metrics in our annual \nCorporate  Sustainability  Report.  We leverage  the requirements  of the European  Union  Battery  Regulation  to \npromote  transparency  in the supply chain. \n\n\f•  Conduct  regular,  transparent,  and genuinely  independent  audits of mines and facilities where  nickel \nand other  critical minerals  are mined and refined  to ensure  that  suppliers are following procedures \nthat  protect  and  respect  human rights  and Indigenous  Peoples’  rights, meet environmental \nstandards,  and  don’t contribute  to climate change. \n\nOur supplier mitigation  strategy  includes requiring  independent  third party  ESG assessments;  mandating  ESG \naudits;  helping suppliers develop foundational  ESG policies (e.g., Codes  of Conduct);  and  maintaining \ncontractual  safeguards,  including termination  rights  for non-compliance. \n\nOn top of the previously mentioned  activities, for direct  raw material  purchases,  independent  on-site audits \nare deployed  for all critical minerals used in EV batteries  to assess mining and  refining  operations.  Identified \nfindings from the audit are  analyzed  and inform time-bound  corrective action plans with ongoing  monitoring. \nThrough  continuous  monitoring,  transparency,  and escalation  mechanisms, Stellantis  enforces  its ESG \nstandards  and supports  alignment  with stakeholder  expectations  and regulatory  frameworks —thereby \naiming to prevent  situations akin to those  documented  in the CRI report \n\n• \n\nSet  explicit, time-bound  targets  to decarbonize  transition  mineral  supply chains and  ensure  that \nsuppliers are taking  concrete  steps to reach those  targets. \n\nSuppliers  are key stakeholders  of Stellantis’  approach  to reduce  CO2 scope 3 upstream  emissions, from ore \nextraction  till components  production,  focusing on emissions generated  from the production  of goods and \nservices purchased  by Stellantis. Our purchasing  department  defined  a target  to increase to 95% the share of \nAPV from key suppliers with CO2 reduction  targets  that  comply with the Paris Agreement  by 2030. We have \nprioritized  components  and  raw materials that  represent  80% of GHG emissions from our BEV supply chain. \nThey are  specifically tracked and  followed by engineering  and  purchasing  teams to focus on reducing  the \ncarbon  footprint  of suppliers providing parts  and materials  with significant GHG emissions.  \n\nFor  direct raw material  purchases,  we establish quantified  and time-bound  targets  in sourcing to advance \ntoward  our 'Carbon  Net Zero' objective.  Major suppliers are requested  to share  their carbon  net zero \nroadmap  to demonstrate  their ability to support  the Stellantis  Carbon  Net Zero Targets,  and  work on an \nemission reduction  plan compliant with the  Paris Agreement.  In addition, suppliers are  asked to participate  in \nthe Carbon  Disclosure Project  (“CDP”) reporting.     \n\nAgain, thank  you for giving us the  opportunity  to respond  to your inquiry.  We remain  open to further \ndialogue  at a future  date.    \n\nThank you,  \n\nRachel Kook \n\nCompliance  Head  – Human Rights"}
