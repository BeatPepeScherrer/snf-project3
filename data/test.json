SIBCL is owned and run by Indian businessmen, and has agreed to be a franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company.  The SIBCL bottling plant would be the first major industry in the region, generating employment and helping drive economic growth and prosperity in the region.

Social audit.\n\n“ Examine why it is that you failed to uncover or why you .gnored the hazards at\nthe factory in Savar, which were in -iolation of Banglace.h's inadequate labour\nlaw and against international labour standards as wel' as your own code of\nconduct covering wages and workiag conditions includiig hours of work and\nhealth and safety. In particular, | would urge you to disclose your company’s\naudil reports for this company.\n\n* Take urgent measures to examine what measures are nic esvary to ensure your\ncode of conduct is properly implemealted throughout your upply chain.\n\n1.1.

Conclusion:\n\n- Although the factories of the suppliers in Bangla:k sh were being audited\nwhen the catastrophe occurred, Spectrum wes not included in the\nreview-normalization process for two reasons: first, the contractual\nmanufacture relationship had taken place thoug)i 1 trader in India, and;\nsecondly, the supplier did net provided the name of its subcontracts. As\na result of the above, Spectrum was not included in the scope of the\nreview.\n\n2. Solidarity Fund\n\nEnsure that the survivors as well as the families of those that ded receive exemplary\ncompensation, as well as the payment of any outstanding waces or henefits. If the\nmanufacturer does not do so, then the branas or retailers sourci» \\ ar the factory should\ntake joint responsibility.\n\nWith regard to this issue we would like to point out:\n\n2.1. That from the very moment the CSR [-epartment became ¢. arc of the catastrophe\nand bearing in mind that the review process was under we, it got in touch with\nCruz Roja Internacional in Spain to be of any assistance thet might be required.\n\n2.2. That, once informed by Clean Clothes Campaign that wher the catastrophe took\nplace several garments of the ZARA brand were being maxufactured, an internal\nenquiry was immediately ordered which confirmed that d wring FY 2003-2004,\napproximately 84,000 units had been nanufactured throuzh the abovementioned\ntrader.\n\n2.3.

That INDITEX promoted the creation of a Task Force beaded by BSCI and\ncomprised of BSCI representatives, lozal unions, local and international NGO's,\nlocal governments and manufacturers.\n\n2.7. That INDITEX invited some of your representatives (M23srs. Mountadas and\nBoix, from CC.OO (Spain), to take part in said Task Force.\n\n\nIMNDITEX\n\n2.8. Last, that the aims targeted by the abovementioned Task force in Dacca to take\nplace in the next few weeks, were, inter alia:\n\n- To carry out a professional and independent engtury in order to clarify\nthe reasons of this catastropbe and to help allocate responsibilitics.\n\n- To carry out a technical and independent reseaich in order to identify\nand asscss the human damages caused by (2 catastrophe to the\nemployees and the families of the deceased, ir. terms of “solidarity”\ninstead of “compensation”.\n\n- Last, to set up a protocol of intervention for fuluwe catastrophes jointly\nwith all those involved in the process.\n\n3. List of suppliers\n\nDisclose full details of your supply chain so that trade unions and others in civil Society\ncan ensure that minimum conditions arz being met. Nikz the world's largest\nSportswear company, released the full list of its suppliers a couple of weeks ago, and\nthere is no reason whatsoever why all othe brand names and ;vtalers should not do\nthe same. Retailers or brands which refuse to do can only be iidged to be afraid of\nbeing exposed as agents of exploitation.\n\n3.1, As we have already stated under paragraphs 1.1. and 1.2. arove, we are presently\ncompleting the first phases of the normalization process regurding the factories of\nthe suppliers of INDITEX worldwide Once this process ii completed, we will\nconsider your proposal.\n\nLast, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the :nterest shown in the\norganization that J am honoured to head and offer you my support to develop jointly\nwith some corporations, trade unions and the civil society, production lines that fully\nobserve and ensure the Basic Human and Working Rights.\n\nShould you require any additional information on the evolution of the Task Force in\nDacca or on any other issues regarding the implantation of our ‘Code of Conduct for\nExternal Manufacturers and Workshops, please contact either riyself or Mr. Javier\nChércoles ~ the Director of the CSR Department at INDITEX.\n\nBest regards\n\nhe Ww\nie NC\n\nDeputy Chairman and CEO"}
