Hereby we answer the questions raised in your \nletter as follows: \n\n1.    A Brief Introduction of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project \n\nRegarding the basic situation of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project, the company \n\nhas made multiple explanations on different occasions and during our exchanges with the local \nmedia in the past.    We are willing to make a brief explanation here again.    The starting point of the \nMyanmar-China crude oil pipeline is located on Madae Island, while that of the Myanmar-China gas \npipeline is located in Kyaukpyu.    The pipeline then goes via Rakhine State, Camaguey Province, \nMandalay Province, and Shan State, and enters China via Ruili.    The total length of the crude oil \npipeline is 771 kilometres, while that of the natural gas pipeline is 793 kilometres.    As agreed \nbilaterally between Myanmar and China, upon completion and commission of the Myanmar-China \noil and gas pipeline, 2 million tons of crude oil and 2 billion cubic metres of natural gas will be loaded \nin Myanmar each year, which could be used to promote the economic development and to improve \nthe living standards of people in Myanmar.    This will actively help solve the energy needs of \nMyanmar.    The Natural Gas Pipeline loading points are located in Kyaukpyu, Yenangyaung, \nTaungtha and Mandalay.   \n\nThe Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline Project is jointly invested by six parties from four countries: \n\nChinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), Daewoo Group of South Korea, OCEBV from \nIndia, Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) and Gas \nAuthority of India Limited (GAIL).    The parties founded Southeast Asia Gas Pipeline Company \n(SEAGP) by each making an investment; SEAGP is responsible for building and operating the \nMyanmar-China gas pipeline.    The natural gas in the Myanmar-China gas pipeline comes from \n\"The Shwe Gas Project\", which is a gas field developed by Daewoo International Ltd. of South \nKorea. \n\nThe Myanmar-China gas pipeline commissioning ceremony was held in Mandalay on 28 July \n\n \n \n \n \n\f2013.    The Myanmar vice president Nyan Tun pointed out in his speech in the commissioning \nceremony, that he believes through this pipeline, Myanmar's economy, industrialisation and \nelectrification will be carried to a higher level.    \"I am particularly grateful for the protection of the \nnatural environment at the construction site and along the pipeline regions, and the loving care given \nto the local people in the construction process of the project.    I hope that the loving care will \ncontinue in Myanmar like the life of the pipeline project.\" \n\n2.    Clarifications on Certain Issues \n\n1. The Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project is built fully in accordance with \n\ninternational standards. \n\nThe Project mainly followed the API and ASME standards.    API (American Petroleum Institute) \nis one of the earliest and most successful worldwide trade associations that develop standards.    It \nis primarily responsible for standardisation of industrial oil and gas equipment.    ASME (American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers) mainly develops and publishes norms and standards for the \nmachinery manufacturing industry.    These are now widely recognised technical standards in the \ninternational petroleum industry.   \n\nIn accordance with API standard, the steel pipe used in the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline \n\nProject is X70 carbon steel pipe which is resistant to high pressure and high temperature \ndifferentials.    The exterior of the steel pipe is covered by corrosion-resistant layers and cathodic \nprotection materials to protect the steel pipe from corrosion.    The damage shown in the photo of the \nreport is actually damage of the corrosion resistant layer, not that of the steel pipe.   \n\nBeginning at the pipeline’s commissioning, to ensure safe and reliable operation of the oil & gas \n\npipeline, the company has used SCADA monitoring and data acquisition systems for 24-hour \nmonitoring of the pipeline's operation status.    With these systems in place, we can master real-time \noperation status of the pipeline, and ensure its safety.   \n\n3PE Protective Layers \n\nPE Layer \n\nAdhesive Layer \n\nEpoxy Layer \n\nWorking Pipe \n\nSteel pipe corrosion-resistant treatment              Structure of the pipeline corrosion-resistant layer   \n\n2. Land Acquisition and Compensation Principles of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas \n\nPipeline Project. \n\nTo do a good job of land acquisition from villagers along the pipeline, the Myanmar Ministry of \n\nEnergy (MOE), MOGE, SEAGP and Southeast Asia Crude Oil Pipeline (SEAOP) jointly established \nan acquisition working group, which is directly responsible for the pipeline project's land acquisition \nand compensation work.    The relevant regional governments' land departments at different levels \nwhere the pipeline passes by are also directly involved in land acquisition compensation work, \nparticipating in the measurement of range of land expropriated, negotiation of the compensation \nstandard, and so on.   \n\nThe land acquisition and compensation for the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project \nalways follow the principles as below: the land acquisition and compensation work shall at all times \nbe in accordance with the laws and regulations of Myanmar; land acquisition along the pipeline shall \nnot take villagers' arable land, or take as little arable land as possible; in case of temples, Buddhist \nPagodas, schools, cemeteries, natural protected areas and heritage, the pipeline shall resolutely \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\favoid them by diverting; acquisition of villagers' land is based on the voluntary principle - in case \ncertain villagers do not agree with the land acquisition, the pipeline shall bypass their land by \nchanging its route; the principle of \"compensate villagers first, and then use the land\" is followed; the \ncompensation payments are made directly to the villagers.   \n\nThe land acquisition for the pipeline project that CNPC is involved in strictly followed the \nrelevant laws and regulations of Myanmar.    The land acquisition process was clear, precise and \nnormalised.    The finalisation of the compensation standards for land acquisition followed strict \nprocedures, and was approved by government departments at multiple levels.    The level of land \ncompensation is set based on factors like the location, land type, type of crop, yield, maturity, market \nvalue of annual harvest etc.    Simple comparison of its level as too high or too low is not appropriate.   \nStandard procedures are in place for calculation of compensation.    Land compensation work is \nalways carried out in an open, transparent, and legitimate manner.    All the land compensation \npayments are received by the land owners personally, while the signing of the land compensation \nagreement is also open to the public.   \n\nA villager of [Xingai], Mandalay \nsigning a land compensation \nagreement \n\nA [Duoma] villager signing a land \ncompensation agreement \n\nAccording to the old Land Administration Law, land compensation standards include crop \ncompensation: the crop compensation term for permanent land acquisition is five years, while that \nfor temporary land acquisition is three years.    After the new Land Administration Law of Myanmar \nwas promulgated at the end of 2012, the provisions required that for permanent land acquisition, \nonly three years' fee of crop compensation need to be paid.    After the new law was promulgated, \nthe company still compensated land owners who had not finished the land acquisition process at \nthat time according to the five-year crop compensation standard for permanent land acquisition.   \nAccording to the land compensation procedures, the land compensation payment is handed directly \nto the villagers in cash (Kyats) by holding land compensation ceremonies.    No third party is used for \ntransfer of the compensation.   \n\nLand Compensation Ceremony \n\nRegarding the land compensation standards, the relevant responsible official from the Ministry \nof Energy of Myanmar has introduced and commented on the \"Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline \nProject Land Compensation Standard\" in many meetings and other public occasions.    The \nresponsible official used data comparison and analysis, and said that even compared to the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAmerican standard, the Myanmar-China pipeline project's land compensation standard is rather high \n(for detailed information of the news, please refer to media reports in November 2012; you can also \nseek further evidence about this from the relevant government department).   \n\nAll in all, the land acquisition of the pipeline project was carried out in strict observance of \n\nrelated laws and regulations of Myanmar.    The acquisition process was clear, precise and \nnormalised.    The finalisation of the compensation standard for land acquisition followed strict \nprocedures, and was approved by government departments at multiple levels.    The level of land \ncompensation is set based on factors like the location, land type, type of crop, yield, maturity, market \nvalue of annual harvest etc.    Simple comparison of its level as too high or too low is not appropriate.   \nStandard procedures are in place for calculation of compensation.    Land Compensation work is \nalways carried out in an open, transparent, and legitimate manner.    All the land compensation \npayments are received by the land owners personally, while the signing of the land compensation \nagreement is also open to the public.   \n\n3. CNPC attaches great importance to environmental protection in the Myanmar-China \n\nPipeline Project. \n\nThe long-distance pipeline project is a non-polluting ecological project, with no emissions, no \ndischarge of polluted water or any other discharge of pollutants.    It has the surest guarantee on the \nenvironment and safety.    The pipeline project will make no impact on the groundwater of residents \nalong the pipeline.     \n\nTo perform the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the pipeline project impartially, EIA \n(including SIA - Social Impact Assessment) of the Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project was \ncarried out by the Thailand-based company IEM through an international tender, in accordance with \nthe World Bank's Guidelines and Equator Principles' norms and standards.    The company strictly \nfollowed international principles, and submitted a report to the responsible authorities of the \nMyanmar government.   \n\nBoth the design and construction of the Myanmar-China pipeline and crude oil terminal project \n\nhave adopted high international engineering standards, with a strict monitoring and prevention \nsolution in place in their operations management, which includes strict engineering design \nstandards, totally enclosed delivery technology, strict engineering quality control, effective \nenvironmental protection measures, and high-standard engineering measures for seismic restraint \nand typhoon restraint, multiple protections for fire safety, as well as 24-hour real-time monitoring, \nstandardised and normalised work procedures, professional equipment service and maintenance, \nand effective emergency treatment and harm reduction measures.    The intrinsically safe project, \ncoupled with the strictly normalised operational management and protective measures all guarantee \nsafe operation.   \n\nThere are placards and warning signs at the construction sites to remind staffto protect the \nenvironment \n\n \n \n\fThe Myanmar-China Oil & Gas Pipeline Project has strict measures for sewage \ntreatment in place.    Firstly, for sewage produced in daily life both by the construction sites and \nmanagement offices, each camp has built-in sewage treatment facilities.    After treatment, the \ndischarge is in compliance with international environmental requirements.    Secondly, here are \nseparate arrangements for household waste and solid waste. : Waste disposal agreements are \nsigned with local sanitation departments, who will recycle and dispose of the waste.   \n\nWaste Classification and Disposal   \n\nCNPC has always attached great importance to protection work of historical and cultural \n\nheritage and flora and fauna protection areas.    At the initial stage of the construction of the pipeline \n- early exploration of the line and piping design stage - the pipeline was always designed to bypass \nor avoid all Myanmar monuments, temples, flora and fauna protection areas, etc. that it might pass \nthrough.    During the construction of the pipeline, the company and its contractors actively provided \nhelp to temples along the pipeline within its means, for example installing flush toilets for a monks’ \ntemple on Madae Island; donating money and goods to temples and orphanages, and so on.   \nThese good deeds are appreciated and welcomed by both the Buddhist monks and laypeople.   \n\n   \n \n\fGave 21 piglets to local villagers of Made Kyun on 14 \nNov2011 \n\nOn 8 Dec2011, to improve the living environment of the \nisland, and to improve the living conditions of the residents, \nwe bought 3,000 pcs baby fish for local residents and released \nthem so that residents can fully make use of the newly built \nreservoir resources. \n\nOn Jan 08, 2012, we donated a flush toilet to the temple on \nthe island so that it is more convenient for the monks to use. \n\nOn 5 Mar2011, went to visit 49 seniors with no family and \nbrought quilts and oil etc. to spread the caring love from \nChinese people to these elderly people. \n\nThe management of the company donated more than 26,920 \nRMB for children on Madae Island, who are too poor to go \nto school. Our slogan was: “Reach out with love” \n\nWith commissioning of the tap water project we built for the \nMadae Island villagers, they can now celebrate their \nWater-Splashing Festival with joy. \n\n \n\fRegarding the impacts the pipeline might have on the soil - people of the Hsipaw region are \n\nconcerned that the salt underground might corrode the pipeline.    We can say in a responsible \nmanner that during the pipeline exploration, we have already researched the various soil conditions \nto learn about the soil environment along the pipeline so that we can prevent corrosion of the \npipeline by the soil - solutions are implemented accordingly.    For the construction of the pipeline, it \ndoes not pass through local salt mines - the pipeline either bypasses or avoids local salt mine areas.   \nAnd in accordance with regulations, the pipeline is protected with corrosion resistance technologies \nin accordance with international standards: the pipeline has protective measures like 3 layers of PE \ncorrosion resistance layers, cathodic protection technology, and so on.   \n\nWe understand the concerns of the Northern Shan Farmers' Committee about pipeline safety, \n\nland compensation and impact of the pipeline on the environment; we feel also perturbed by the \nmisunderstandings caused by local people's lack of knowledge of the pipeline.    As a responsible \ncompany, we are committed to implementing the project in accordance with international standards \nand norms.    The land compensation also has a set of standard procedures in place.    While having \ncarried out the required environmental impact assessment before the construction of the project, we \nalso attach extreme importance to the protection of the environment in the building process.    We \nhope that by publicly clarifying and publishing this information, the misunderstanding of local people \ncan be eliminated.    What is more, we hope that through our project, we can bring a real sense of \nwell-being to the local people.   \n\nWe welcome media from all walks of life in Myanmar to report on the Myanmar-China pipeline \nproject, so public opinion can supervise each aspect of the project.    Meanwhile, we also call upon \nrelevant organizations to let the facts speak for themselves, and to make objective assessments and \npublications about the Myanmar-China pipeline."}

We take the allegations in the report very seriously. We have \nconducted our own initial investigation and believe there are a number of inconsistencies and \ninaccuracies in the report. We have shared the NLC’s report with Chi Fung’s owners and we \nwill continue our internal investigation. If our internal investigation finds non-compliances, we \nwill  immediately  work  with  the  factory  to  remediate  the  problems,  facilitate  the  engagement \nwith  relevant  stakeholders  and  commission  independent  third  parties  to  verify  that  the \nremediation has been effective. \n\nThe  adidas  Group  has  a  dedicated  team  of  more  than  60  Social  and  Environmental  Affairs \n(SEA) members, including highly qualified labour and health and safety experts, who regularly \nmonitor  our  global  supply  chain.  Through  our  work  we  ensure  that  factories  making  our \nproducts consistently deliver fair, safe and healthy working conditions. We have worked with \nChi Fung for more than 10 years. During this time, we have regularly monitored and reviewed \nChi  Fung’s  payroll  records  and  have  not  found  the  serious  overtime  compensation  issues \nalleged  in  this  report.  Likewise  the  same  results  when  reviewing  the  working  hour  and  work \nscheduling records. SEA has been aware of cameras and monitors in the factory and spoke \nwith  the  owners  more  than  a  year  ago.  The  system,  used  to  quickly  resolve  production  and \nmechanical issues on the floor, was turned off and has not been used. Bathrooms are clean, \nserviceable  and  in  good  working  order. SEA  monitors  the  relationships  between  Chi  Fung \nis  a  company  harassment  policy \nsupervisors  and  production  workers,  and \ncommunicated to all employees.  \n\nthere \n\nOur  suppliers  are  also  subject  to  an  additional  level  of  oversight. In  Chi  Fungs’s  case,  there \nhave been independent third-party audits by Fair Labor Association (FLA) monitors. The FLA \ncombines  the  efforts  of  industry,  civil  society  organisations  and  colleges  and  universities  to \nprotect  workers’  rights,  improve  working  conditions  worldwide  and  promote  adherence  to \ninternational  labour  standards. In  addition,  Chi  Fung  has  been  audited  and  certified  by  the \nWorld Wide Responsible Apparel Production (WRAP) certification programme. \n\nWhenever we have identified employment, health and safety non-compliance issues, Chi Fung \nhas  worked  with  us,  the  Fair  Labor  Association,  other  customers,  members  of  local  civil \nsociety,  and  El  Salvador’s  regulatory  agencies  to  promptly  remediate  any  non-compliance. \nThe  remediation  process  includes  implementation  of  improved  policies  and  practices  for \nmanaging employment relationships."}

In keeping with our Guiding Principle of\n\"respect for people,\" our position with regards to supply chain management is to establish\nbusiness relations based on mutual trust and respect, open communications and cooperative\nproblem solving.\n\nThat said, we have strong policies in place, outlined in our CSR policy: Con fribution Towards\nSustainable Development, revised in August 2008, to insure that our company and our business\npartners and suppliers in each region adhere to our standards.\n\nFurthermore, in February 2009, we issued \"Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines,\" which have been\nshared with our tier one suppliers and are available online at:\nhttp://www.toyota.co.jp/en/csr/relationship/pdf/supplier.html\n\nBased on our Guiding Principles, these guidelines state the policies we expect our suppliers to\ncomply with in undertaking their activities, including:\n\n• Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of each country and region.\n• Non-discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics protected by local applicable\nlaws and regulations, such as race, ethnic and national origin, religion, age, gender, etc.\n\n• Non-tolerance of any form of harassment in the workplace based upon the personal\n\ncharacteristics protected by local applicable laws and regulations.\n\n• Non-tolerance for any use of child or forced labor.\n• Payment of wages in compliance with local applicable laws and regulations.\n• Compliance with local applicable laws and regulations governing employees' working\n\nhours.\n\n\f• Recognition of employees' right to freely associate, or not to associate, complying with\n\nlocal applicable laws and regulations.\nPlacing the highest priority on safety and health programs and policies in the workplace,\nso that employees are able to work without undue concerns, and strive to prevent\naccidents and injuries from happening in the workplace.\n\nToyota requests that suppliers implement CSR initiatives based on the Guidelines. Toyota also\nrequests that suppliers expand CSR initiatives with other business partners based on the\nGuidelines. Toyota will regularly request that suppliers self-check their activities in line with the\nGuidelines and make improvements where necessary.\n\nIn addition, Toyota plans to continue holding seminars on compliance for suppliers. Toyota\nviews suppliers as equal partners based on mutual trust. Therefore, if suppliers discover\nproblems during the course of their self-check, Toyota will encourage them to vigorously solve\nthe problem(s) independently through their own internal structure and systems. If asked, Toyota\nwill support its suppliers' efforts.\n\nFurthermore, in North America, we are actively engaged with the Automotive Industry Action\nGroup (AIAG), whose mission is to improve guidelines and productivity within the industry,\namong other goals. Specifically, we are collaborating with AIAG on the development of training\nmaterials and workshops on human rights and best practices for suppliers.\n\nAs a company committed to \"kaizen\" or continuous improvement, we realize that there is still\nmuch work to be done. We continue to engage our employees and stakeholders around the\nworld to help strengthen our commitment to CSR in every aspect of our business.\n\nThank you again for your continued interest in Toyota.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJames Wiseman\nGroup Vice President\nToyota Motor North America, Inc.\n\n2"}

El Derby 055, \nTorre 1, Of 902 \nSantiago de Surco \nLima - Perú \n\nThank  you  for  your  interest  in  our  Peruvian  operations  and  the  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  the article  Environmental Monitoring  of  Xstrata  Tintaya  Copper  Mine  in \nCusco, Peru by Eike Sophie Hümpel, EJOLT, 3 August 2012. \n\nXstrata  is  deeply  committed  to  the  principles  of  sustainable  development  and  our \norganisation in Peru is no exception. Our Tintaya operation conducts  comprehensive \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  all  community  participatory  and  company  monitoring \nactivities  to  date  have  demonstrated  that  Tintaya  operates  in  line  with  Peruvian  law \nand Xstrata’s industry-leading standards. \n\nTintaya  retains  and  recycles  all  process  water  on-site  and  we  do  not  discharge  into \nlocal  water  bodies.  We  do  not  produce  or  use  mercury,  arsenic  or  lead  in  our \nprocesses.  Upstream  and  downstream  monitoring  results  shows  that  water  quality  is \nconsistent  and there  is no  impact  from  our  mining  operations.  We  have  publicly  and \nrepeatedly  rejected  allegations  of  environmental  pollution  at  Tintaya  including  river \npollution. \n\nWith  respect  to  the  report  commissioned  by  Vicaria  de  la  Solidardid  which  analysed \nwater and soil samples from the region, it is important to note that the study did not \nfind  that  Tintaya  contaminated  local  land  or  water  sources.  It  found  that  Saldo  river \nwater  was  not  suitable  to  be  used  as  drinking  water.  Under  Peruvian  legislation  this \nuntreated, natural water is not considered to be potable water. \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  the  study’s  methodology  did  not  take  into  account  the \nhydrogeological characteristics of the Salado River which originates from hydrothermal \nsources and naturally contains heavy metals. In addition the study did not account for \nthe  geological  characteristics  of  the  area,  such  as  the  natural  background \nmineralisation  present  in  the  region  which  has  been  confirmed  by  previous \nparticipative  monitoring  processes  involving  local  and  international  non-government \norganisations.  The  mineralisation  described  by  Ms  Hümpel  in  her  article  is  not  only \npresent  in  the  Espinar  province  but  the  wider  Andean  mountain  region  as  found  by \nstudies  undertaken  by  the  Peruvian  Health  Ministry  and  Peruvian  Geological,  Mining \nand Metallurgy Institute (part of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe  Tintaya  mine  will  cease  operations  later  this  year.  Xstrata  has  invested  $1.47 \nbillion  to  develop  the  Antapaccay  deposit,  located  10  kilometres  from  the  Tintaya \nopen  pit,  which  will  extend  the  operation’s  life  by  at  least  20  years  and  provide \nongoing  socio-economic  benefits  for  the  people  of  Espinar  province  and  the  Cusco \nregion.  As part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the development of \nthe  Antapaccay  mine,  accredited  consultants  undertook  environmental  baseline \nstudies including water, soil and sediment characterisation studies. These studies and \ntheir  findings  confirmed  natural  background  mineralisation  in  the  area  and  the \npresence  of  metals  in  soil  and  water  sources.  The  studies  were  submitted  to  the \nPeruvian  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines,  Espinar  municipal  government  and  Cuzco \nregional government and the findings were disclosed to local communities and other \nstakeholders  through  workshops  and  public  hearings  as  part  of  the  EIA  regulatory \napproval process. \n\nFollowing the completion of mining activities at Tintaya, the main pit will be used as a \ntailings  storage  facility  for  the  new  Antapaccay  mine.  Extensive  engineering  and \nenvironmental  impact  studies  were  undertaken  by  international  experts  to  assess  the \nsafety and feasibility of this option. These studies considered, among other things, the \ngeochemical, hydrological and stability aspects of the tailings and pit and determined \nthis  method  of  tailings  storage  is  safe  and  will  significantly  reduce  Antapaccay’s \nenvironmental footprint. \n\nWe  are  pleased  that,  in  line  with  our  repeated  offers  to  initiate  further  participatory \nenvironmental monitoring, a number of new environmental monitoring processes were \nagreed in response to community concerns at a meeting in April 2012 held in Espinar \nby  representatives  of  national  government,  the  state’s  health  and  environmental \ninstitutions,  the  Espinar  provincial  municipality  and  local  civil  society  organisations. \nThese  activities,  including  participatory  monitoring  of  waterways  and  toxicological \nstudies of human and animal health, will be led by the relevant state regulatory bodies \nfor  health,  the  environment  and  agriculture.  We  welcome  these  initiatives  which  are \nscheduled to commence over the coming months and will cover the whole of Espinar \nProvince. \n\nWe  regularly  report  on  our  sustainability  performance  and  further  information, \nincluding  the  Xstrata  Copper  Southern  Peru  2011  sustainability  report,  is  available \nfrom the following link:  www.xstratacopper.com \n\nKind regards \n\nJosé Marún \nExecutive Vice President  \nSouth America Operations Division   \nXstrata Copper"}

The initiative came from a need to showcase that leadership in sustainability goes well \ntogether with good performance. In the role model factories we want to find best practice examples, \nboth within the environment and social area, which should set the standard for our other suppliers \nand the whole industry. During this fall we will have our first evaluation in the role model factory in \nCambodia and we already have a number of positive indications. The dialogue between factory \nmanagement and elected employee representatives has improved, and they hold regular meetings. \nWorking together, they have begun to create a new wage structure in the factory, with expertise and \nexperience being reflected in wage setting. The management has confirmed that they take a positive \nview of involving employee representatives, and that they can see how this will benefit both the \ntextile workers and the company in the long term. We are also involved in projects and programs \nwhich have the aim of strengthening employees’ rights and their ability to negotiate on their own \nbehalf on their terms and conditions through trade unions or other elected employee \nrepresentatives. In partnership with SIDA (The Swedish government), the ILO and IF Metall, we have \ninitiated a programme in Cambodia aimed at strengthening industrial relations in the textile industry \nand increasing the number of collective agreements. \n\nThis process takes time and raising wages in the textile industry is a shared responsibility involving a \nnumber of stakeholders. Our vision is that a fair living wage covering workers basic needs should be \npaid by all our commercial goods suppliers.  Our role as a buyer is not to set the level of wages. Our \napproach is that wages should be negotiated between the parties on the labour market. To promote \nsystemic change across the whole industry, and not just our suppliers, we continue to engage with \ngovernments, other brands and stakeholders. The governments need to strengthen the required \nlegal frameworks such as regular wage revisions and functioning industrial relations. H&M is in \nconstant dialogue with other brands and have sent a joint letter to the Cambodian government and \nGMAC to clarify the brands position in the upcoming wage negotiations. We have engaged in close \ndialogue with IndustryALL, who represent the affiliated Trade Unions on ground in Cambodia. We \nexpect factory workers to earn a fair living wage and this wage should be negotiated between the \nlegitimate labour parties. Overall we expect the installation of a regular industry collective bargaining \nprocess for wages which is fair and takes into account UN body ILO technical expertise  \nPlease see the letter here: http://about.hm.com/en/news/newsroom/news.html/en/joint-call-on-\nhigher-minimum-wage-in-cambodia.html"}

Total EP Nigeria has consequently set up a specific Land and Claims \ndepartment, the role of which specifically includes visiting communities and negotiating agreements \nwhen land is acquired, which occurs through fair contracts agreed by the parties. \n\n3/ As regards demonstrations: it should be noted that during a peaceful demonstration, one striking \nworker died from a heart attack. Individuals not involved in the demonstration attacked a soldier at \nthe same time and took his weapon from him. After this weapon was stolen, one person was killed. \n\n4/ As regards the Ibewa incident: the area affected by the eruptions which, contrary to what is \nalleged, did not result in explosions, is an uninhabited area with a few hundred square metres of \ncassava, and not several thousand. This area is used for the occasional hunting of wild game and to \npick fruit from a few scattered palm trees. At the time of the aforementioned eruption, as a \nprecautionary measure, access to the area was closed prohibited. The families and communities \naffected were duly compensated at the time for the inconvenience caused by this ban on accessing \nthe area for security reasons. Total subsequently bought the land in question and duly compensated \nthe communities affected. It is consequently wrong to claim that the communities were not \ncompensated. \n\n5/ As regards flaring: to be more accurate, flaring has required official permission since 1984. It is \nreiterated that our position on flaring is known and published in our 2013 CSR report. Our objective is \nconsequently to reduce flaring by 50%, excluding the start-up phase, between 2005 and 2014. Lastly, \nsince 2000, the Group has moreover decided to no longer undertake any new development that \nincludes continuous flaring beyond the start up-phase. The Group is also very active within the \n\"Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership“ led by the World Bank. \n\n6/ As regards the jobs created: the oil industry is not the largest provider of employment, and there \nare other industries that provide more. Total EP Nigeria however currently employs more than 100 \nmembers of the Egi community on a permanent basis, as well as more than a thousand locals under \nservice contracts (drivers, caterers, labourers, maintenance workers, security guards, etc.). \nTotal E&P Nigeria’s activities are in line with the Group’s code of conduct and are evaluated by \nqualified third parties. Recently the American non-profit organisation CDA carried out an assessment \nof the Group’s social impact in the region.

Total EP Nigeria  a ainsi mis en place un département \ndédié « land and claims » dont l’une des missions est précisément de visiter les communautés \net de négocier les accords lorsqu’il y a acquisition de terrains, qui  font l’objet de contrats \néquitables agrées par les parties. \n\n3/Au sujet du bilan des manifestations : il est à noter que lors d’une manifestation pacifique, \nun ouvrier gréviste est décédé d’une crise cardiaque. Des personnes extérieures à la \nmanifestation  ont  attaqué dans le même temps un militaire et lui ont volé son arme. Suite à \nce vol d’armes,  une personne a été tuée. \n\n4/Au sujet de l’incident d’Ibewa : la zone concernée par les éruptions  qui, contrairement à ce \nqui est allégué, ne se sont pas soldées par des explosions est une zone inhabitée sur laquelle se \ntrouvent quelques ares de manioc, et non plusieurs hectares.  Cette zone est utilisée pour la \nchasse occasionnelle de gibier de brousse et pour la cueillette de fruits issus de  palmiers \nisolés. Au moment de l’éruption précitée, par mesure de précaution, l’accès à cette zone a été \nbarré. A ce moment, les familles et communautés concernées ont été dument dédommagées \nde l’absence de jouissance ( « inconvenience ») liée à cette interdiction d’accès pour raison de \nsécurité. Par la suite, Total a racheté le terrain concerné et a dument compensé les \ncommunautés concernées. Par conséquent, il est erroné de prétendre  que les communautés \nn’ont pas été indemnisées. \n\n5/Au sujet du torchage : pour être plus précis, depuis 1984, le torchage est soumis à une \nautorisation. Pour rappel, notre position sur le torchage est connue et publiée dans notre \nrapport CSR 2013. Ainsi, nous avons pour objectif de réduire de 50% celui-ci, hors phase de \ndémarrage, entre 2005 et 2014. Enfin, depuis 2000, le Groupe  a en outre décidé de ne plus \nentreprendre de nouveaux développements comprenant du torchage continu au-delà de la \nphase de démarrage. Le Groupe est également très actif au sein du « Global Gas Flaring \nReduction partnership» piloté par la Banque Mondiale. \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\f6/Au sujet des emplois créés, le secteur du pétrole est moins pourvoyeur d’emploi que \nd’autres secteurs.  Total EP Nigeria emploie cependant actuellement plus de 100 membres de \nla communauté des Egi à titre permanent, ainsi que plus d’un millier de locaux au titre de \ncontrats de service (chauffeurs, alimentation, ouvriers, maintenance, sécurité, etc.). \n\nLes activités de Total E&P Nigéria sont en ligne avec le Code de conduite du Groupe et font \nl’objet de contrôles par des tiers qualifiés. L’organisation américaine à but non lucratif – CDA \n– a récemment effectué sur place une évaluation des impacts sociétaux du Groupe dans la \nrégion.

Through our investments in our assets and the long-term commitments we make \nto the countries in which we operate, we believe that our global presence and economic strength \ncontribute positively to socioeconomic development in our host countries. \n\nMany of the unsubstantiated comments made by Public Eye are general statements, with no \nreference to specific incidents, independent witnesses or research reports. Public Eye does not \nprovide any explanation as to how its opinion has been reached or research conducted. \n\nWe are a major investor in the developing world and we are proud of the difference that our presence \ncan make.  Of the 200,000 people who work for us, around 80,000 are based in Africa. Many of our \ninvestments are located in challenging locations with diverse organisational culture and complex \nlegacy issues. Communities in these areas often face restricted access to basic services such as \nsanitation, water, energy and infrastructure. We undertake and contribute to activities and \nprogrammes designed to improve the quality of life for the people in the communities that surround \nour operations.  \n\nIn 2013, we paid US$3.7 billion in royalties and taxes, and a further US$4.3 billion in wages to our \n200,000 employees and contractors. US$170 million was spent on social investment such as \nhealthcare and education. Throughout the world our assets contribute to the building and \nmaintenance of roads, water infrastructure and other service development projects for the long-term \nbenefit of the local communities. \n\nOur corporate sustainability framework balances social, environmental, ethical and commercial \ninterests at every level of our group. This framework is called Glencore Corporate Practice (GCP). We \ndesigned and implemented the GCP to be in line with internationally recognised, good practice, sector \nspecific standards and we continue to monitor its performance to ensure it is fit for purpose. Our Code \nof Conduct is an important part of the GCP and sets out our corporate values and provides clear \nguidance to our employees about how we do business.  \n\nWe hope this response will fully address the unfounded allegations that have been presented by \nPublic Eye as a ‘nomination’ for its 2015 awards. \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 1: Pollution and health risks relating to our Colombian coal assets \nThe Public Eye ‘nomination’ makes a general accusation of Glencore’s Colombian coal assets \ncausing pollution and being responsible for health risks in the communities in which we operate. In \nparticular, Public Eye references the Colombian Ministry of Environment’s request for three rural \ncommunities to be relocated.  \n\nOur approach to community engagement derives from our overall commitment to respecting human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. We are committed to the UN Universal Declaration on Human \nRights, and support the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In the course of our \nmining operations we may need to disturb land that is used by a local community. We seek to avoid \nresettlement, but when it is the only viable course of action we consult closely with the affected \npopulation and seek to obtain its broad-based support.  \n\nWe are working closely with the communities near our operations in Colombia. Earlier this year, we \nsigned the resettlement action plan with Plan Bonito, one of the communities we have been asked to \nresettle. The process with the remaining communities of Boqueron and El Hatillo is ongoing.  \n\nA robust Resettlement Governance Structure has been established and an independent organisation \nhas been engaged as the facilitator. Our approach is consistent with IFC Performance Standard 5: \nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement. In line with this Standard, the resettlement process is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ffollowing a commonly accepted timeline and any attempt to expedite the process would risk ignoring \ncommunity needs and threaten the consultation process.  \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 2: Anti-union attitude in Colombia \nThe Public Eye ‘nomination’ accuses Glencore of having an ‘anti-union’ attitude in Colombia – again \nthere is no reference to specific incidents or a reason given as to how this conclusion has been \nreached. \n\nWe are committed to upholding and protecting human rights, including recognising our employees’ \nright to unionise. We have maintained constructive dialogue with the trade unions in Colombia. \n\nProdeco respects the rights of freedom of association for all of its employees, which are rights that are \nembodied by the Colombian Constitution. \n\nAt Prodeco, there are two industry unions (Sintraenergética and Sintracarbón) and one base union \n(Sintraprodeco). Prodeco holds periodic meetings with the unions to discuss concerns and to clarify or \ncorrect any disagreement within the parties. When issues are raised, Prodeco respects the unions’ \nrights to resort to legal measures to settle differences – Colombian law supports the use of arbitration \nwhen differences persist. Prodeco also respects the unions’ right to present and negotiate collective \npetitions. \n\nProdeco has reached agreement with the unions over a number of labour agreements that are \ncurrently in effect. In 2013, Prodeco finalised a three year union agreement, which was negotiated in \njust 20 days. This was in contrast to other Colombian coal mining companies that experienced lengthy \nnegotiations that often ended in industrial action.  \n\nProdeco is aware that a number of union leaders in Colombia have received threats of violence. In \n2013, Prodeco received information regarding threats being made against the trade union leaders at \nits operations. Prodeco immediately reported this information to the authorities and provided \nprotection for the individuals concerned. \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 3: Legal proceedings for environmental pollution being brought in \nArgentina \nPublic Eye has made a general statement that there are several legal proceedings for environmental \npollution being brought against a mining company in Argentina in which Glencore has a 50% stake \n(Minera Alumbrera Ltd).  \n\nIn Argentina, we are the operators (through Minera Alumbrera) of the Bajo de la Alumbrera project, in \nwhich Goldcorp Inc and Yamana Gold also have interests. Yacimientos Mineros de Agua de Dionisio \n(YMAD), - a public entity in which the province of Catamarca, the National University of Tucumán and \nthe Argentine National State have an interest, - is the owner of the mining rights and has a \nparticipation in the benefits of the project.  As no particular legal case is named by Public Eye, our \nresponse to the accusations of environmental damage notes these cases: \n\n•  A claim that Minera Alumbrera contaminated a mineral spring on private property – to which \n\nMinera Alumbrera has demonstrated that no water was affected and that no damage was caused \nto the claimants; \n\n•  Two claims relating to alleged contamination caused by our filter plant discharge – in both \n\nincidents, expert witnesses have shown that Minera Alumbrera’s discharges met the applicable \nprovincial legal requirements.  In a third case, in response to evidence provided by an expert \nwitness that showed compliance with the applicable provincial legal requirements, the Judge, at \nthe request of the Federal Prosecutor, ordered the case to be closed; and \n\n•  Legal action resulting from alleged contamination from Minera Alumbrera’s tailing dam – the \nexpert witness, appointed by the Federal Judge, identified no environmental changes to the \nnatural conditions of the area and that the results for around 70 chemical substances were in line \nwith natural levels. \n\nFurther information on the approach that Minera Alumbrera takes and the importance it attaches to \noperating in an environmentally aware manner is available at: http://www.alumbrera.com.ar/ \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fUnsubstantiated allegation 4: Accusations of profiting from child labour in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo \nPublic Eye has accused Glencore of profiting from child labour at our assets in the Katanga province \nof the DRC. This is an allegation we have publicly refuted on numerous occasions. \n\nIn 2010, our concession at Tilwezembe was seized by illegal miners. We have been unable to access \nthis concession since its occupation without endangering the safety of our people. We are aware of \nconcerns that human rights abuses may be taking place at the concession and wholeheartedly \ncondemn any violations that may occur. At no time has neither Glencore nor any of its subsidiaries \nbenefited from or received material sourced from this deposit. We have requested assistance from the \ngovernment in resolving the matter, and remain in communication with the authorities to bring this \nissue to a satisfactory resolution.  \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 5: Tax avoidance by Glencore’s Zambian copper asset \nPublic Eye alleged that Glencore’s Zambian subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines, has avoided paying \nprofit tax. This is simply untrue and has been repeatedly denied by Glencore – the statements made \nby Glencore on this topic are available on our website. These allegations stem from an incomplete \nleaked draft report that has repeatedly been shown to be factually flawed. A complete report has \nnever been issued by the companies who drafted the report. \n\nSince acquisition of the assets the corporate shareholders have invested over $2.4 billion in capital \nprojects to redevelop and expand Mopani’s operations. These investments have secured the long-\nterm future of the business, doubling employment, increasing production and improving safety. \n\nTo date, Mopani has paid over US$800 million in taxes, royalties and other dues to Government since \nprivatisation. Mopani is audited every year by Deloitte and its accounts have always been given a \nclean bill of health. As a public company, Mopani’s accounts are lodged with Securities and Exchange \nCommission as well as the Companies Registry in Lusaka and are publicly available.  \n\nMopani was recently awarded the best reporting company in line with EITI standards for \ndemonstrating consistency and strict adherence to EITI reporting requirements. \n\nUnsubstantiated allegation 6: general, non-incident specific allegation of failure to mitigate \nhuman rights and the environment impacts \nRespect for human rights is core to our approach to business. We are committed to the United \nNations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We support the UN Guiding Principles on Business \nand Human Rights as a framework for the responsibilities of governments and corporations to protect \nthe rights of individuals and groups and ensure that redress is available if any of these rights are \ninfringed. \n\nOur Group Human Rights Policy was developed in 2013 to strengthen our approach to protecting the \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of our people and our stakeholders. The Policy addresses \nthe key risks to human rights faced by our operations, including such topics as labour practices, \nresettlement activities, use of security, and engagement with communities, particularly vulnerable \ngroups such as indigenous peoples. It also reinforces our commitment to integrating human rights \nconsiderations into all business processes, and to protecting our stakeholders’ right to remedy by \nreviewing and strengthening the complaints and grievance mechanisms in place.  \n\nWe are aware that our global operations can have both a direct and indirect impact on the \nenvironment. We are committed to identifying, understanding and mitigating this environmental \nimpact, integrating this consideration into our strategic planning, management systems and day-to-\nday operations. We comply with applicable laws, regulations and other requirements for \nenvironmental management. Where these are less stringent than our own standards we seek to \nexceed the statutory requirements wherever possible. \n\nIn summary \nWe continue to work on improving the management of our operational impact, both positive and \nnegative. We are encouraged by the improvements in our performance. One major project, which \ncompleted in 2014, was the new acid plant at Mopani, which now captures 97% of its SO2 emissions \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f– a world-class standard. Prior to the purchase of the complex by Mopani, 100% of the SO2 generated \nby the operation was emitted directly into the atmosphere – the completion of this project ends an 80 \nyear legacy of SO2 emissions in the town of Mufulira. \n\nWe are proud of the external recognition that our efforts have received. This was recently evidenced \nby our admission into the membership of the ICMM following a rigorous independent assessment \nprocess.  \n\nWhile we are proud of the progress we have made in our sustainability performance, we recognise \nthat we must understand and address the challenges that remain. We believe that conducting our \nbusiness in a sustainable and responsible manner will deliver shared benefits to both our \nstakeholders and to our shareholders, to whom we are committed to delivering value. To this end, we \nwill continue to find ways in which to improve our processes, systems and performances and our goal \nremains one of continuous improvement across all our activities."}

The \n\nsuit  was  initiated  by  the  Maranhão  Human  Rights  Society  (SMDH),  the  Black  Cultural  Centre  of \n\nMaranhão (CCN) and the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI). It questions the government’s decision \n\nto  license  the  new  rail  line  in  discrete  pieces.  This  approach  allowed  Vale  to  produce  a  simplified \n\nenvironmental impact assessment (called a basic environmental plan), thereby avoiding an evaluation \n\nof  cumulative  impacts.  It  also  allowed  Vale  to  dispense  with  important  elements  of  the  standard \n\nenvironmental  review  process,  such  as  public  hearings  and  community  consultations.  Vale  was \n\nexempted from obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of the traditional communities affected by \n\nthe  project.  Consequently,  the  process  for  determining  mitigation  measures  and  for  assessing \n\ncompensation for damages was also inadequate. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOn  July  26,  2012,  a  federal  judge  recognized  the  irregularities  in  the  licensing  process  and \n\nordered  that  construction  on  the  rail  line  be  halted  until  Vale  revised  its  impact  studies,  carried  out \n\npublic meetings in the twenty-seven municipalities that the railway crosses, and obtained the free, prior \n\nand informed consent of affected indigenous and quilombola communities. Shortly after the court order \n\nwas issued, BNDES announced its decision to finance the project. The Brazilian government used the \n\nannouncement  to  justify  its  determination  that  the  expansion  project  is  in  the  public  interest.  This \n\ncharacterization  made  way  for  a  court  ruling  (suspensão  de  segurança)  that  allowed  construction  on \n\nthe railway to proceed, despite the irregularities, in order to avoid any impact on the national economy. \n\nThe complainants have appealed the decision and the matter will be reviewed shortly by the Superior \n\nCourt of Justice. \n\nThe  company’s  basic  environmental  plan  provides  partial  and  imprecise  information  regarding \n\nthe  number  of  families  that  will  need  to  be  relocated  to  make  way  for  the  expansion,  as  well  as  the \n\ntiming and conditions for relocation.  \n\nAccording to an administrative procedure initiated by the Public Defender, the company plans to \n\ndisplace  more  than  1000  families.  Some  of  these  families  have  already  been  forcibly  removed. \n\nNegotiations regarding their relocation were carried out in secret between Vale and affected individuals, \n\nwithout the supervision of government authorities. Residents lacked assess to legal advice.  \n\nCommunities  also  complain  about  the  lack  of  infrastructure to facilitate  safe  passage  over  the \n\nrailway. With the second train line in operation, the frequency of passing trains will increase, exposing \n\nlocal residents to even greater risk”. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA  Vale  esclarece  que  o  licenciamento  ambiental  da  duplicação  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás \n\n(EFC)  foi  respaldado  nos  padrões  legais  de  âmbito  federal,  estadual  e  municipais,  de  forma  que  as \n\nalegações constantes do relatório da ECA Watch não correspondem à realidade do projeto.  \n\nTodos  os  estudos,  planos  e  programas  socioambientais  desenvolvidos  para  mitigação  dos \n\nimpactos  causados  pela  obra  foram  regularmente  apresentados  e  consolidados  no  Plano  Básico \n\nAmbiental  (PBA).  Em  relação  às  comunidades  indígenas  e  quilombolas,  foram  desenvolvidos \n\ndiagnósticos, matrizes de impacto e recomendações específicas para cada comunidade afetada.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAo  contrário  do  que  afirma  o  relatório,  a  Vale  agiu  de  acordo  com  as  previsões  legais, \n\npromovendo um processo público e transparente, com especial preocupação com os estudos técnicos \n\nquanto  aos  povos  indígenas  e  comunidades  quilombolas  e  extenso  diálogo  com  as  mesmas.  A \n\ninterlocução com as comunidades próximas à ferrovia é permanente.  \n\nRegistra-se  que  foram  realizadas  reuniões  públicas  com  as  comunidades  afetadas  nas  datas \n\nde  09,  10,  12,  13  de  julho  de  2012,  além  das  reuniões  dedicadas  exclusivamente  às  comunidades \n\nquilombolas e indígenas. Tais reuniões e audiências públicas observaram os termos da Resolução nº \n\n09/86  –  CONAMA,  que  prevê  o  procedimento  para  participação  popular  no  âmbito  do  licenciamento \n\nambiental.  \n\nEm decorrência da regularidade dos estudos e em todo o processo de consulta pública, a Vale \n\nobteve  as  devidas  licenças  ambientais  para  instalação  do  projeto,  obtendo,  inclusive,  anuência  da \n\nFUNAI e da Fundação Palmares para expansão da ferrovia.  \n\nApesar  do  contato  frequente  com  as  comunidades  afetadas,  ocupações  irregulares  vem \n\nocorrendo  na faixa de  domínio das  ferrovias,  ameaçando  tanto as operações quanto aos  ocupantes. \n\nVisando regularizar tal situação, a empresa vem negociando com as famílias a realocação,  por meio \n\nde  procedimentos  que  seguem  padrões  estabelecidos  pelo  Banco  Mundial.  Nossas  ações  são \n\norientadas  por  cinco  importantes  documentos  internos:  a  Norma  de  Remoção  Involuntária  de \n\nVulneráveis,  a  Política  de  Atuação  Social,  o  Procedimento  de  Gerenciamento  Social  para  Remoção \n\nInvoluntária,  o  Manual  de  Relação  com  Comunidades  para  Projetos  de  Capital  e  o  Guia  de \n\nRelacionamento  com  Comunidades,  que  estabelecem  princípios,  diretrizes,  critérios,  papéis  e \n\nresponsabilidades para a condução dos processos de remoção involuntária.  \n\nNo  que  tange  o  procedimento  de  Consentimento  Livre  Prévio  e  Informado  para  populações \n\nindígenas  e  tradicionais,  é  importante  destacar  que  tal  procedimento  não  se  encontra  devidamente \n\nregulamentado  em  âmbito nacional.  Embora o  Brasil  tenha  aderido  à  Convenção  nº  169 da OIT,  por \n\nmeio  do  Decreto  Legislativo  nº  143/2002, \n\nfaz-se  necessária  regulamentação  que  estipule \n\nprocedimentos, bem como os limites de aplicação da norma. \n\nIndependentemente  disso,  o  diálogo  constante  e  transparente  estabelecido  entre  a  Vale  e  as \n\ncomunidades  tradicionais  ao  longo  da  EFC,  assim  como  a  disponibilização  de  todas  as  informações \n\nnecessárias  relacionadas  ao  empreendimento,  tanto  presencialmente,  quanto  pela  internet,  atendem \n\nao objetivo essencial pretendido pela Convenção nº 169 da OIT. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fObserve-se  que  a  regularidade  do  licenciamento  ambiental  foi  reafirmada  em  decisão  judicial \n\ndo  Tribunal  Regional  Federal  (TRF),  que  reconheceu  que  as  medidas  adotadas  pela  Vale  estão  em \n\ntotal  consonância  com  as  exigências  dos  órgãos  técnico-ambientais  competentes.  A  título  de \n\nilustração, transcrevemos abaixo trecho de decisão judicial nesse sentido:  \n\n“Dos  dados  técnicos  e  estudos  presentes  no  processo  de  licenciamento,  praticamente \n\ntodos advêm da Administração Pública, a saber, da Fundação Cultural Palmares, do INCRA e \n\ndo IBAMA, e estão presentes nos estudos ambientais que compõem o licenciamento ambiental.  \n\nPortanto,  sem  elementos  concretos  que  justifiquem  a  paralisação  das  obras  de \n\nduplicação  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás,  a  tutela  antecipada  se  mostra  extremamente \n\nprejudicial  à  ordem  e  à  economia  pública,  posto  que  fulmina  a  atividade  do  Administrador \n\nPúblico, voltado ao licenciamento de implementação de obra de infraestrutura estratégica para \n\no  País,  que  visa  interligar  os  pátios  de  estacionamento  preexistentes,  “a  fim  de  suprir  a \n\ncrescente demanda associada ao transporte de insumos, materiais e pessoas” (fl. 5).”  \n\nFrisa-se  que  a  obra  não  se  refere  à  construção  ou  a  duplicação  inteira  da  ferrovia,  mas  tão \n\nsomente à interligação de pátios ferroviários já existentes ao lado da linha férrea original, o que trará \n\nbenefícios, inclusive, ao transporte de passageiros. Nesse sentido, a Vale vem investindo fortemente \n\nna formação de mão de obra local e em programas sociais e ambientais que visam o desenvolvimento \n\nsustentável da região e de sua população.  \n\nVale’s response  \n\nVale clarifies that the environmental license process concerning the duplication of EFC Railroad \n\nwas based in legal standards of federal, state and municipal range, in a way that the allegations of the \n\nECA Watch report do not correspond to the reality of the project. \n\nAll  studies,  plans  and  social-environmental  programs  developed  for  the  mitigation  of  impacts \n\ncaused by the work were regularly presented and consolidates in the Basic Environmental Plan (BEP). \n\nRegarding  the  indigenous  and  quilombolas  communities,  diagnostics,  impact  matrixes  and  specific \n\nrecommendations have been developed for each affected communities. \n\nOn  the  contrary  of  what  states  the  report,  Vale  acted  accordingly  to  the  legal  provisions, \n\npromoting  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special  regard  to  the  technical  studies  concerning \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\findigenous and quilombola communities, and lengthy dialog with said communities. The communication \n\nwith the population living near the railroad is constant. \n\nThere  have  been  public  reunions  with  the  affected  communities  in  July  09,  10,  12,  and  13  in \n\n2012, besides the reunions dedicated exclusively to the indigenous and quilombola communities. Said \n\nreunions observed the terms of the CONAMA Resolution nº 09/86, which states the means of popular \n\nparticipation in the environmental licensing process. \n\nSince  the  studies  done  and  all  the  public  consultation  process  have  been  done  with  strict \n\nregularity, Vale acquired the respective licenses for the installation of the project, including the approval \n\nof FUNAI and Fundação Palmares for the expansion of the railroad. \n\nAlthough  the  contact  with  affected  communities  is  frequent,  irregular  occupations  have  been \n\noccurring along the railroad, threatening both the operations and the occupiers. Aiming to regularize the \n\nsituation,  the  company  has  been  negotiating  with  the  families  their  reallocation,  by  procedures  that \n\nfollow standards set by the World Bank. Our actions are guided by   five key internal documents: The \n\nVulnerable Involuntary Relocation Norm, the Social Action Policy, Involuntary Resettlement Procedure \n\nof  Vulnerable  People,  the  Community  Relations  Manual  for  Capital  Projects  and  the  Community \n\nRelations  Guide;  establishing  principles,  instruction,  criteria,  roles  and  actions  in  the  process  of \n\ninvoluntary relocation. \n\nRegarding  the  procedure  of  Free,  Prior  and  Informed  Consent  of  indigenous  and  traditional \n\npopulations, it’s important to highlight that said procedure is not thoroughly regulated in national sphere. \n\nAlthough Brazil has signed the OIT Convention nº 169, by the Legislative Decree nº 143/2002, there is \n\nstill  necessity  of  a  regulation  that  stipulates  procedures,  as  well  as  limits  to  the  application  of  said \n\nnormative. \n\nAside  from  that,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialog  established  between  Vale  and  the \n\ntraditional  communities  located  along  EFC,  as  well  as  the  availability  of  all  necessary  information \n\nrelated to the enterprise, in person or by the internet, fulfill the essential purpose intended by the OIT \n\nConvention nº 169. \n\nIt’s  important  to  note  that  the  regularity  of  the  environmental  licensing  was  reaffirmed  in  a \n\njudicial  decision  of  the  Federal  Regional  Court  (FRC)  that  recognized  that  the  measures  adopted  by \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

To \n\nillustrate, we transcript below part of said decision: \n\n“Of  the  technical  data  and  studies  presented  in  the  licensing  processes,  practically  all \n\ncome  from  the  Public  Administration,  such  as,  Cultural  Foundation  Palmares,  INCRA  and \n\nIBAMA, and are present in the environmental studies that comprise the environmental licensing. \n\nTherefore, with no concrete elements that justify the halting of the duplication works on \n\nthe  EFC  Railroad,  the  preliminary injunction  presents  itself  as  extremely  harmful  to  the  order \n\nand public economy, as it fulminates the activity of the Public Administrator, inclined to licensing \n\nthe  implementation  of  infrastructure  works  strategic  to  the  country,  that  aim  to  connect \n\npreexistent  parking  yards,  ‘intending  to  supply  the  increasing  demand  associated  with  the \n\ntransport of inputs, materials and people’” \n\nWe would like emphasize that the work does not concern the construction or duplication of the \n\nentire  railroad,  but  only  the  interconnection  of  preexisting  parking  yards  next  to  the  original  railroad, \n\nwhich will bring benefits, inclusively, to the transportation of passengers.  In this sense, Vale has been \n\nstrongly investing in the training of local labor force and in social and environmental programs, which \n\naim for the sustainable development of the region and its population. \n\n2)  Ação Civil Pública Monge Belo  \n\nProcesso 0021337-52.2011.4.01.3700 \n\nAutor: Ministério Público Federal \n\nRéus: IBAMA e VALE SA \n\nLitisconsorte Ativo: Defensoria Publica da União  \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nA  lawsuit  was  initiated  in  2011  by  the  Federal  Public  Ministry  to  defend  the  rights  of  the \n\nquilombola  communities  of  Santa  Rosa  dos  Pretos  and  Monge  Belo  (Itapecuru-Mirim,  Maranhão).  In \n\n2012 the suit was dropped and an agreement was signed between the parties, establishing a series of \n\nobligations  for  Vale  and  three  federal  government  agencies.  The  company  agreed  to  construct \n\ninfrastructure to enhance community safety in the area of the railway and to refrain from intervening in \n\nthe communities’ collective land titling process.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn successive legal decisions, the most recent of which was issued on September 26, 2014, the \n\ncourt  found  that  neither  Vale  nor  the  government  agencies  had  fulfilled  their  obligations  to  the \n\ncommunities.  Also  in  September,  Santa  Rosa,  Monge  Belo  and  other  affected  communities  in  the \n\ninterior of Maranhão blocked the Carajás railway for five days. The communities protested Vale and the \n\ngovernment’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the legal agreement. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nEm decisão interlocutória datada de 26/09/2014, o juiz indicou que nem a Vale, nem os órgãos \n\npúblicos, cumpriram o acordo firmado com o Ministério Público Federal. Ocorre que em 23/10/2014, a \n\nVale apresentou ao Juízo sua resposta ao referido despacho em relação ao cumprimento do acordo, \n\ndemonstrando que atendeu aos pontos questionados, quais sejam: \n\nCorpos Hídricos: A Vale apresentou ao IBAMA os estudos referentes à recuperação dos corpos \n\nhídricos afetados pela Estrada de Ferro Carajás e sua duplicação. O Ibama solicitou complementações \n\nao  estudo,  que  foram  apresentadas  pela  Vale  27/06/2014.  Até  o  momento,  a  empresa  aguarda \n\ndefinição do órgão ambiental para dar continuidade ao projeto.   \n\nViadutos:  A  Vale  iniciou  a  construção  do  1º  viaduto  na  localidade  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  em \n\n07/08/2013, logo em seguida da emissão de autorização do IBAMA para início das obras. A obra de \n\nconstrução do viaduto encontra-se em andamento, estando dentro do prazo previsto no acordo com o \n\nMinistério Público Federal.  \n\nMelhorias: A Vale realizou melhorias nas 4 (quatro) passagens de nível localizadas em Monge \n\nBelo,  Santa  Helena,  Jaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  conforme  prevê  o \n\nacordo  com  o  Ministério  Público  Federal.  Destaca-se  que  os  próprios  analistas  do  IBAMA,  em \n\ninspeção realizada em 29/05/2014, atestaram que “todas as PN’s – passagens de nível - se encontram \n\nem  boas  condições  estruturais,  não  sendo  necessárias  ações  além  de  manutenção  de  rotina,  já \n\nexecutadas pela empresa”. \n\nDessa  forma,  a  Vale  entende  que  vem  cumprindo  com  suas  obrigações  e  que  não  houve \n\ndescumprimento do acordo celebrado com o Ministério Público Federal.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fVale’s response  \n\nOn an interlocutory decision of 26/09/2014, the judge indicated that neither Vale, nor the public \n\nagencies, fulfilled the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nIn  23/10/2014,  Vale  presented  at  court  its  answer  to  the  judicial  order,  concerning  the \n\ncompliance  with  the  agreement.  In  doing  so,  the  company  demonstrated  the  due  fulfillment  of  the \n\nquestioned points, namely: \n\nHydric  Bodies:  Vale  presented  to  IBAMA  the  studies  regarding  the  recuperation  of  the  hydric \n\nbodies  affected  by  Carajás  Railroad  and  its  duplication.  IBAMA  demanded  complementation  of  the \n\nstudies presented by VALE in 27/06/2014. Until this moment, the Company awaits definition from the \n\nEnvironmental Agency to give continuity do the project.  \n\nOverpass: Vale has initiated the construction of the first overpass of Jaibara dos Nogueiras site \n\nin  07/08/2013,  immediately  after  being  authorized  by  IBAMA  to  start  the  construction.  The  work  is \n\ncurrently in progress, being on schedule with the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nEnhancements:  Vale enhanced 4 (four)  level  crossings  located  in  Monge Belo,  Santa Helena, \n\nJaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  as  provided  in  the  agrément  with  the \n\nFederal  Public  Ministry.  It’s  important  to  note  that  the  analysts  of  IBAMA  themselves,  during  an \n\ninspection  done  in  29/05/14,  attested  that  “all  level  crossings  are  in  good  structural  condition,  being \n\nunnecessary any actions beyond the regular maintenance already performed by the Company”.  \n\nThus,  Vale  understands  that  it  has  been  complying  with  its  obligations  and  that  there  hasn’t \n\nbeen any non-compliance to the agreement celebrated with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\n3)  Acusações de Ex-Empregado \n\nIn 2013 a former Vale employee accused the company of illegally spying on a number of actors \n\nwho  are  critical  of  its  operations.  The  whistleblower,  who  played  an  important  role  in  the  company’s \n\nsecurity  department,  released  documents  revealing  that  the  company  took  steps  to  infiltrate  social \n\nmovements  that  accompany  affected  communities  in  the  defense  of  their  rights.  According  to  the \n\ndocuments,  the  company  developed  complex  biographical  files  from  information  that  was  allegedly \n\nobtained illegally. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe whistleblower accused the company of further illegal acts including the payment of bribes to \n\ngovernment officials, influence peddling, tapping telephones and hacking computers. Vale refuted the \n\nallegations  but  publicly  acknowledged  that  it  monitors  social  organizations.  In  2014,  the  International \n\nFederation of Human Rights conducted a fact-finding mission to Brazil and urged Brazilian authorities \n\nto take measures to prevent Vale from carrying out illegal espionage. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA  Vale  não  reconhece  e  refuta  as  alegações  do  ex-empregado.  As  autoridades  competentes \n\nestão  investigando  o  assunto  e  algumas  investigações  já  foram  arquivadas  devido  à  falta  de \n\ninformações e provas.  \n\nVale’s response \n\nVale  does  not  recognize  and  refute  the  allegations  of  the  former  employee.  The  competent \n\nauthorities are investigating the matter and some investigations were already dismissed due to lack of \n\ninformation and evidence.  \n\n4)  Gestão Ambiental no Sudeste do Pará e no Projeto S11D \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nThe project is also responsible for the destruction of native forest cover, and for damage to ecosystems \n\nand public health caused by air, soil and water contamination. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA Vale protege ou colabora com a proteção de uma área 3,5 vezes maior do que a ocupada por \n\nsuas  operações  globais,  totalizando  13,7  mil  Km²    de  áreas  naturais.  Em  2012,  a  Vale  investiu  US$ \n\n1,025 bilhão em proteção e conservação ambiental, em linha com o valor investido no ano anterior.  \n\nDesde  que  iniciou  a  extração  de  minério  de  ferro  no  sudeste  do  Pará,  em  1985,  a  empresa \n\ncontribui  com  a  preservação  de  mais  de  400  mil  hectares  de  mata  nativa,  através  da  criação  da \n\nFloresta Nacional de Carajás, e da proteção de outras áreas do bioma amazônico, em parceria com o \n\nInstituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio). \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fA Vale vem evoluindo no desenvolvimento de tecnologias e sistemas de gestão que a levaram \n\na  possuir,  hoje,  uma  operação  de  menor  impacto.  E  toda  essa  experiência  de  quase  30  anos  está \n\nreunida  no  projeto  S11D,  um  empreendimento  cuidadosamente  planejado  para  atingir  a  excelência \n\noperacional e à manutenção do meio ambiente ecologicamente equilibrado.  \n\nNo  projeto  S11D,  a  preocupação  em  diminuir  os  impactos  ambientais  começa  na  localização \n\nescolhida  para  a  instalação  da  usina  de  processamento  do  minério  de  ferro.  Será  em  uma  área  já \n\nantropizada (com interferência do ser humano) e fora da Floresta Nacional de Carajás.  \n\nCom o mesmo objetivo, de minimizar o impacto na floresta, 70% do ramal ferroviário que levará \n\na  produção  até  a  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás  também  serão  construídos  em  área  de  pastagem.  No \n\ntrecho que  passa  dentro  dos  limites  da  unidade  de  conservação,  serão  construídos  um  túnel  e  uma \n\nponte  para  evitar  impactos  diretos  na  vegetação  e  na  fauna,  com  investimento  adicional  de  R$  200 \n\nmilhões.  \n\nUma vez em operação, o projeto S11D seguirá diversos procedimentos que visam minimizar os \n\nimpactos  ambientais  negativos,  bem  como  maximizar  os \n\nimpactos  positivos  gerados  pelo \n\nempreendimento. . \n\nVale´s response \n\nVale  protects  or  helps  to  protect  an  area  3.5  times  larger  than  that  occupied  by  its  global \n\noperations,  adding  up  to  13,700  km2.  In  2011,  Vale  invested  US$1.030  billion  in  environmental \n\nmonitoring and protection, 40% up on the previous year.  \n\nSince  it  began  mining  iron  ore  in  the  the  Southeast  of  Pará  in  1985,  the  company  has  been \n\nhelping to conserve Carajás National Forest and other areas of the Amazon biome in partnership with \n\nthe Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).  \n\nOver the years, Vale has also developed technologies and management systems that have led \n\nto lower-impact operations. All of this experience gained over more than 30 years is incorporated into \n\nthe S11D project, which has been carefully planned to achieve operational excellence. \n\nIn  the  S11D  project,  Vale’s  concern  to  reduce  environmental  impacts  starts  with  the  location \n\nchosen for the iron ore processing plant: it will be built in an area already affected by mankind outside \n\nCarajás National Forest, thereby avoiding the need for deforestation. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

Along  the  stretch  within  the \n\nConservation  Unit,  a  tunnel  and  bridge  will  be  built  to  avoid  direct  impacts  on  vegetation  and  fauna, \n\ninvolving an additional investment of R$200 million.  \n\nOnce in operation, S11D will follow various procedures designed to minimize its environmental \n\nimpacts. \n\n5)  Segurança na Estrada de Ferro Carajás \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nThe  railway  lacks  basic  security  infrastructure  and  as  a  result,  trains  frequently  hit  local \n\nresidents, often resulting in death or serious injury. Between 2006 and 2013, two local residents were \n\nkilled or injured on average every three months. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nCom  relação  à  segurança  da  ferrovia,  dados  da  Agência  Nacional  de  Transportes  Terrestres \n\n(ANTT),  demonstram  que  a  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás  (EFC)  apresenta  desempenho  em  segurança \n\nsuperior à média brasileira, com expressiva melhora ao longo dos últimos anos. \n\nFonte: http://www.antt.gov.br/index.php/content/view/36436/Relatorios_de_Acidentes.html \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

O processo visa aumentar \n\nas atividades  de  manutenção  preventiva  e preditiva e,  consequentemente,  a confiabilidade  da  malha \n\nferroviária. \n\nAlém  disso,  a  EFC  possui  equipamentos  de  alta  tecnologia  de  operação  e  manutenção  tais \n\ncomo: desguarnecedoras e renovadoras de linha ferroviária, equipamentos ultrassom, computador de \n\nbordo  nas  locomotivas,  uso  de  simuladores  para formação  de  mão-de-obra,  sistemas  de  sinalização \n\ncom  falha  segura,  dispositivos  de  detecção  de  descarrilamento,  instrumentação  automatizada  de \n\nperformance  do  material  rodante  (Wayside),  equipamentos  de  detecção  de  aquecimento  de  rodas  e \n\nrolamentos (Hot box e Hot Wheel), sistemas de tração distribuída, entre outros. \n\nSeguindo normas da ANTT, a Vale adota um sistema de sinalização acústica como medida de \n\nsegurança  para  minimizar  a  ocorrência  de  acidentes.  O  acionamento  das  buzinas  é  realizado  pelo \n\nmaquinista sempre que há passagens oficiais ou quando é verificada a existência de risco operacional, \n\natendendo a critérios estabelecidos pelo Regulamento de Operações Ferroviárias da Vale (ROF). \n\nAs passagens oficiais são travessias que cruzam a ferrovia, homologadas e reconhecidas pela \n\nVale, e recebem sinalização e manutenção adequada A Estrada de Ferro Carajás possui oficialmente  \n\n126  passagens  em  nível,  distribuídas  ao  longo  dos  892  km  de  ferrovia  com  distância  média  entre \n\npassagens  de  aproximadamente  7km.  Adicionalmente,  as  equipes  de  Relacionamento  com \n\nComunidades e Segurança Empresarial, em conjunto com as equipes de Operação e Manutenção da \n\nferrovia,  realizam  inspeções  e  ações  periódicas  com  foco  na  segurança  da  população  que  reside \n\npróximo  à  ferrovia.  Entre  os  trabalhos  realizados  estão:  realização  de  campanhas  de  segurança  e \n\ndistribuição de materiais sobre a convivência próximo à ferrovia, tais como cartilhas, jogos educativos, \n\nfolders e calendários, ações em salas de aula, reuniões com lideranças locais, e nas travessias sobre \n\na ferrovia etc. \n\nAlém  disso,  no  processo  de  expansão  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás,  estão  previstas  a \n\nconstrução  de  mais  de  40  viadutos  rodoviários  sobre  a  ferrovia,  garantindo  mais  segurança  na \n\ntravessia de motoristas e pedestres. \n\nVale´s response \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fRegarding  the  safety  of  the  railway,  data  from  the  National  Transportation  Agency  (Agência \n\nNacional de Transportes Terrestres - ANTT), show that the Carajás railroad (EFC) has superior safety \n\nperformance than the Brazilian average, with significant improvement over the past years. \n\nTo  guarantee  maximum  operational  safety  the  Carajás  Railway  has  developed  a  structured \n\nmaintenance process for its tracks and rolling stock (locomotives and cars). The aim of this process is \n\nto promote preventive and predictive maintenance, thereby improving the reliability of the railway.  \n\nIn  addition,  the  Carajás  Railway  has  high-technology  equipment  such  as  railway  tamping  and \n\nrenewal  machines,  ultrasound  equipment,  onboard  computers  in  locomotives,  training  simulators, \n\nfailsafe  signaling  systems,  derail  detection  equipment,  automated  wayside  rolling  stock  performance \n\ninstrumentation, hot box and hot wheel detection equipment, and distributed traction systems. \n\nIn  accordance  with  ANTT  standards,  Vale  uses  an  acoustic  signaling  system  as  a  safety \n\nmeasure  to  minimize  the  occurrence  of  accidents.  Horns  are  activated  by  the  locomotive  engineer \n\nwhenever there are official railway crossings or when people on or very near the track are detected, in \n\nline with criteria established in Vale’s Railway Operation Regulations. \n\nOfficial  railway  crossings  are  crossings  approved  and  recognized  by  Vale,  with  appropriate \n\nsignaling  and maintenance plans  in accordance with ABNT  standards. The Carajás  Railway  now  has \n\n126  railway  crossings  along  its  892  km  of  tracks,  spaced  approximately  7  km  apart  on  average.  In \n\naddition, Vale’s Community Relations and Business Security teams, together with the railway Operation \n\nand  Maintenance teams,  conduct periodic  actions focused  on the  safety of  the  people  living  near  the \n\nrailway.  This  work  includes  the  holding  of  safety  campaigns  and  the  distribution  of  materials  such  as \n\npamphlets,  educational  games,  brochures  and calendars, to be  used in classrooms,  at meetings  with \n\nlocal leaders and at railway crossings, etc. \n\nIn addition, in the process of expansion of the Carajás Railroad, 40 viaducts will be constructed \n\nover the railway, providing more security at the crossing of drivers and pedestrians. \n\nRio de Janeiro, 12 de Janeiro de 2015. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOn  July  26,  2012,  a  federal  judge  recognized  the  irregularities  in  the  licensing  process  and \n\nordered  that  construction  on  the  rail  line  be  halted  until  Vale  revised  its  impact  studies,  carried  out \n\npublic meetings in the twenty-seven municipalities that the railway crosses, and obtained the free, prior \n\nand informed consent of affected indigenous and quilombola communities. Shortly after the court order \n\nwas issued, BNDES announced its decision to finance the project. The Brazilian government used the \n\nannouncement  to  justify  its  determination  that  the  expansion  project  is  in  the  public  interest.  This \n\ncharacterization  made  way  for  a  court  ruling  (suspensão  de  segurança)  that  allowed  construction  on \n\nthe railway to proceed, despite the irregularities, in order to avoid any impact on the national economy. \n\nThe complainants have appealed the decision and the matter will be reviewed shortly by the Superior \n\nCourt of Justice. \n\nThe  company’s  basic  environmental  plan  provides  partial  and  imprecise  information  regarding \n\nthe  number  of  families  that  will  need  to  be  relocated  to  make  way  for  the  expansion,  as  well  as  the \n\ntiming and conditions for relocation.  \n\nAccording to an administrative procedure initiated by the Public Defender, the company plans to \n\ndisplace  more  than  1000  families.  Some  of  these  families  have  already  been  forcibly  removed. \n\nNegotiations regarding their relocation were carried out in secret between Vale and affected individuals, \n\nwithout the supervision of government authorities. Residents lacked assess to legal advice.  \n\nCommunities  also  complain  about  the  lack  of  infrastructure to facilitate  safe  passage  over  the \n\nrailway. With the second train line in operation, the frequency of passing trains will increase, exposing \n\nlocal residents to even greater risk”. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA  Vale  esclarece  que  o  licenciamento  ambiental  da  duplicação  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás \n\n(EFC)  foi  respaldado  nos  padrões  legais  de  âmbito  federal,  estadual  e  municipais,  de  forma  que  as \n\nalegações constantes do relatório da ECA Watch não correspondem à realidade do projeto.  \n\nTodos  os  estudos,  planos  e  programas  socioambientais  desenvolvidos  para  mitigação  dos \n\nimpactos  causados  pela  obra  foram  regularmente  apresentados  e  consolidados  no  Plano  Básico \n\nAmbiental  (PBA).  Em  relação  às  comunidades  indígenas  e  quilombolas,  foram  desenvolvidos \n\ndiagnósticos, matrizes de impacto e recomendações específicas para cada comunidade afetada.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

A \n\ninterlocução com as comunidades próximas à ferrovia é permanente.  \n\nRegistra-se  que  foram  realizadas  reuniões  públicas  com  as  comunidades  afetadas  nas  datas \n\nde  09,  10,  12,  13  de  julho  de  2012,  além  das  reuniões  dedicadas  exclusivamente  às  comunidades \n\nquilombolas e indígenas. Tais reuniões e audiências públicas observaram os termos da Resolução nº \n\n09/86  –  CONAMA,  que  prevê  o  procedimento  para  participação  popular  no  âmbito  do  licenciamento \n\nambiental.  \n\nEm decorrência da regularidade dos estudos e em todo o processo de consulta pública, a Vale \n\nobteve  as  devidas  licenças  ambientais  para  instalação  do  projeto,  obtendo,  inclusive,  anuência  da \n\nFUNAI e da Fundação Palmares para expansão da ferrovia.  \n\nApesar  do  contato  frequente  com  as  comunidades  afetadas,  ocupações  irregulares  vem \n\nocorrendo  na faixa de  domínio das  ferrovias,  ameaçando  tanto as operações quanto aos  ocupantes. \n\nVisando regularizar tal situação, a empresa vem negociando com as famílias a realocação,  por meio \n\nde  procedimentos  que  seguem  padrões  estabelecidos  pelo  Banco  Mundial.  Nossas  ações  são \n\norientadas  por  cinco  importantes  documentos  internos:  a  Norma  de  Remoção  Involuntária  de \n\nVulneráveis,  a  Política  de  Atuação  Social,  o  Procedimento  de  Gerenciamento  Social  para  Remoção \n\nInvoluntária,  o  Manual  de  Relação  com  Comunidades  para  Projetos  de  Capital  e  o  Guia  de \n\nRelacionamento  com  Comunidades,  que  estabelecem  princípios,  diretrizes,  critérios,  papéis  e \n\nresponsabilidades para a condução dos processos de remoção involuntária.  \n\nNo  que  tange  o  procedimento  de  Consentimento  Livre  Prévio  e  Informado  para  populações \n\nindígenas  e  tradicionais,  é  importante  destacar  que  tal  procedimento  não  se  encontra  devidamente \n\nregulamentado  em  âmbito nacional.  Embora o  Brasil  tenha  aderido  à  Convenção  nº  169 da OIT,  por \n\nmeio  do  Decreto  Legislativo  nº  143/2002, \n\nfaz-se  necessária  regulamentação  que  estipule \n\nprocedimentos, bem como os limites de aplicação da norma. \n\nIndependentemente  disso,  o  diálogo  constante  e  transparente  estabelecido  entre  a  Vale  e  as \n\ncomunidades  tradicionais  ao  longo  da  EFC,  assim  como  a  disponibilização  de  todas  as  informações \n\nnecessárias  relacionadas  ao  empreendimento,  tanto  presencialmente,  quanto  pela  internet,  atendem \n\nao objetivo essencial pretendido pela Convenção nº 169 da OIT. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

A  título  de \n\nilustração, transcrevemos abaixo trecho de decisão judicial nesse sentido:  \n\n“Dos  dados  técnicos  e  estudos  presentes  no  processo  de  licenciamento,  praticamente \n\ntodos advêm da Administração Pública, a saber, da Fundação Cultural Palmares, do INCRA e \n\ndo IBAMA, e estão presentes nos estudos ambientais que compõem o licenciamento ambiental.  \n\nPortanto,  sem  elementos  concretos  que  justifiquem  a  paralisação  das  obras  de \n\nduplicação  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás,  a  tutela  antecipada  se  mostra  extremamente \n\nprejudicial  à  ordem  e  à  economia  pública,  posto  que  fulmina  a  atividade  do  Administrador \n\nPúblico, voltado ao licenciamento de implementação de obra de infraestrutura estratégica para \n\no  País,  que  visa  interligar  os  pátios  de  estacionamento  preexistentes,  “a  fim  de  suprir  a \n\ncrescente demanda associada ao transporte de insumos, materiais e pessoas” (fl. 5).”  \n\nFrisa-se  que  a  obra  não  se  refere  à  construção  ou  a  duplicação  inteira  da  ferrovia,  mas  tão \n\nsomente à interligação de pátios ferroviários já existentes ao lado da linha férrea original, o que trará \n\nbenefícios, inclusive, ao transporte de passageiros. Nesse sentido, a Vale vem investindo fortemente \n\nna formação de mão de obra local e em programas sociais e ambientais que visam o desenvolvimento \n\nsustentável da região e de sua população.  \n\nVale’s response  \n\nVale clarifies that the environmental license process concerning the duplication of EFC Railroad \n\nwas based in legal standards of federal, state and municipal range, in a way that the allegations of the \n\nECA Watch report do not correspond to the reality of the project. \n\nAll  studies,  plans  and  social-environmental  programs  developed  for  the  mitigation  of  impacts \n\ncaused by the work were regularly presented and consolidates in the Basic Environmental Plan (BEP). \n\nRegarding  the  indigenous  and  quilombolas  communities,  diagnostics,  impact  matrixes  and  specific \n\nrecommendations have been developed for each affected communities. \n\nOn  the  contrary  of  what  states  the  report,  Vale  acted  accordingly  to  the  legal  provisions, \n\npromoting  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special  regard  to  the  technical  studies  concerning \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

The communication \n\nwith the population living near the railroad is constant. \n\nThere  have  been  public  reunions  with  the  affected  communities  in  July  09,  10,  12,  and  13  in \n\n2012, besides the reunions dedicated exclusively to the indigenous and quilombola communities. Said \n\nreunions observed the terms of the CONAMA Resolution nº 09/86, which states the means of popular \n\nparticipation in the environmental licensing process. \n\nSince  the  studies  done  and  all  the  public  consultation  process  have  been  done  with  strict \n\nregularity, Vale acquired the respective licenses for the installation of the project, including the approval \n\nof FUNAI and Fundação Palmares for the expansion of the railroad. \n\nAlthough  the  contact  with  affected  communities  is  frequent,  irregular  occupations  have  been \n\noccurring along the railroad, threatening both the operations and the occupiers. Aiming to regularize the \n\nsituation,  the  company  has  been  negotiating  with  the  families  their  reallocation,  by  procedures  that \n\nfollow standards set by the World Bank. Our actions are guided by   five key internal documents: The \n\nVulnerable Involuntary Relocation Norm, the Social Action Policy, Involuntary Resettlement Procedure \n\nof  Vulnerable  People,  the  Community  Relations  Manual  for  Capital  Projects  and  the  Community \n\nRelations  Guide;  establishing  principles,  instruction,  criteria,  roles  and  actions  in  the  process  of \n\ninvoluntary relocation. \n\nRegarding  the  procedure  of  Free,  Prior  and  Informed  Consent  of  indigenous  and  traditional \n\npopulations, it’s important to highlight that said procedure is not thoroughly regulated in national sphere. \n\nAlthough Brazil has signed the OIT Convention nº 169, by the Legislative Decree nº 143/2002, there is \n\nstill  necessity  of  a  regulation  that  stipulates  procedures,  as  well  as  limits  to  the  application  of  said \n\nnormative. \n\nAside  from  that,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialog  established  between  Vale  and  the \n\ntraditional  communities  located  along  EFC,  as  well  as  the  availability  of  all  necessary  information \n\nrelated to the enterprise, in person or by the internet, fulfill the essential purpose intended by the OIT \n\nConvention nº 169. \n\nIt’s  important  to  note  that  the  regularity  of  the  environmental  licensing  was  reaffirmed  in  a \n\njudicial  decision  of  the  Federal  Regional  Court  (FRC)  that  recognized  that  the  measures  adopted  by \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

To \n\nillustrate, we transcript below part of said decision: \n\n“Of  the  technical  data  and  studies  presented  in  the  licensing  processes,  practically  all \n\ncome  from  the  Public  Administration,  such  as,  Cultural  Foundation  Palmares,  INCRA  and \n\nIBAMA, and are present in the environmental studies that comprise the environmental licensing. \n\nTherefore, with no concrete elements that justify the halting of the duplication works on \n\nthe  EFC  Railroad,  the  preliminary injunction  presents  itself  as  extremely  harmful  to  the  order \n\nand public economy, as it fulminates the activity of the Public Administrator, inclined to licensing \n\nthe  implementation  of  infrastructure  works  strategic  to  the  country,  that  aim  to  connect \n\npreexistent  parking  yards,  ‘intending  to  supply  the  increasing  demand  associated  with  the \n\ntransport of inputs, materials and people’” \n\nWe would like emphasize that the work does not concern the construction or duplication of the \n\nentire  railroad,  but  only  the  interconnection  of  preexisting  parking  yards  next  to  the  original  railroad, \n\nwhich will bring benefits, inclusively, to the transportation of passengers.  In this sense, Vale has been \n\nstrongly investing in the training of local labor force and in social and environmental programs, which \n\naim for the sustainable development of the region and its population. \n\n2)  Ação Civil Pública Monge Belo  \n\nProcesso 0021337-52.2011.4.01.3700 \n\nAutor: Ministério Público Federal \n\nRéus: IBAMA e VALE SA \n\nLitisconsorte Ativo: Defensoria Publica da União  \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nA  lawsuit  was  initiated  in  2011  by  the  Federal  Public  Ministry  to  defend  the  rights  of  the \n\nquilombola  communities  of  Santa  Rosa  dos  Pretos  and  Monge  Belo  (Itapecuru-Mirim,  Maranhão).  In \n\n2012 the suit was dropped and an agreement was signed between the parties, establishing a series of \n\nobligations  for  Vale  and  three  federal  government  agencies.

Also  in  September,  Santa  Rosa,  Monge  Belo  and  other  affected  communities  in  the \n\ninterior of Maranhão blocked the Carajás railway for five days. The communities protested Vale and the \n\ngovernment’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the legal agreement. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nEm decisão interlocutória datada de 26/09/2014, o juiz indicou que nem a Vale, nem os órgãos \n\npúblicos, cumpriram o acordo firmado com o Ministério Público Federal. Ocorre que em 23/10/2014, a \n\nVale apresentou ao Juízo sua resposta ao referido despacho em relação ao cumprimento do acordo, \n\ndemonstrando que atendeu aos pontos questionados, quais sejam: \n\nCorpos Hídricos: A Vale apresentou ao IBAMA os estudos referentes à recuperação dos corpos \n\nhídricos afetados pela Estrada de Ferro Carajás e sua duplicação. O Ibama solicitou complementações \n\nao  estudo,  que  foram  apresentadas  pela  Vale  27/06/2014.  Até  o  momento,  a  empresa  aguarda \n\ndefinição do órgão ambiental para dar continuidade ao projeto.   \n\nViadutos:  A  Vale  iniciou  a  construção  do  1º  viaduto  na  localidade  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  em \n\n07/08/2013, logo em seguida da emissão de autorização do IBAMA para início das obras. A obra de \n\nconstrução do viaduto encontra-se em andamento, estando dentro do prazo previsto no acordo com o \n\nMinistério Público Federal.  \n\nMelhorias: A Vale realizou melhorias nas 4 (quatro) passagens de nível localizadas em Monge \n\nBelo,  Santa  Helena,  Jaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  conforme  prevê  o \n\nacordo  com  o  Ministério  Público  Federal.  Destaca-se  que  os  próprios  analistas  do  IBAMA,  em \n\ninspeção realizada em 29/05/2014, atestaram que “todas as PN’s – passagens de nível - se encontram \n\nem  boas  condições  estruturais,  não  sendo  necessárias  ações  além  de  manutenção  de  rotina,  já \n\nexecutadas pela empresa”. \n\nDessa  forma,  a  Vale  entende  que  vem  cumprindo  com  suas  obrigações  e  que  não  houve \n\ndescumprimento do acordo celebrado com o Ministério Público Federal.  \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av. Graça Aranha 26, Centro - CEP 20030-900, Rio de Janeiro / RJ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fVale’s response  \n\nOn an interlocutory decision of 26/09/2014, the judge indicated that neither Vale, nor the public \n\nagencies, fulfilled the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nIn  23/10/2014,  Vale  presented  at  court  its  answer  to  the  judicial  order,  concerning  the \n\ncompliance  with  the  agreement.  In  doing  so,  the  company  demonstrated  the  due  fulfillment  of  the \n\nquestioned points, namely: \n\nHydric  Bodies:  Vale  presented  to  IBAMA  the  studies  regarding  the  recuperation  of  the  hydric \n\nbodies  affected  by  Carajás  Railroad  and  its  duplication.  IBAMA  demanded  complementation  of  the \n\nstudies presented by VALE in 27/06/2014. Until this moment, the Company awaits definition from the \n\nEnvironmental Agency to give continuity do the project.  \n\nOverpass: Vale has initiated the construction of the first overpass of Jaibara dos Nogueiras site \n\nin  07/08/2013,  immediately  after  being  authorized  by  IBAMA  to  start  the  construction.  The  work  is \n\ncurrently in progress, being on schedule with the agreement signed with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\nEnhancements:  Vale enhanced 4 (four)  level  crossings  located  in  Monge Belo,  Santa Helena, \n\nJaibara  dos  Rodrigues,  Jaibara  dos  Nogueiras  e  Pedrinhas,  as  provided  in  the  agrément  with  the \n\nFederal  Public  Ministry.  It’s  important  to  note  that  the  analysts  of  IBAMA  themselves,  during  an \n\ninspection  done  in  29/05/14,  attested  that  “all  level  crossings  are  in  good  structural  condition,  being \n\nunnecessary any actions beyond the regular maintenance already performed by the Company”.  \n\nThus,  Vale  understands  that  it  has  been  complying  with  its  obligations  and  that  there  hasn’t \n\nbeen any non-compliance to the agreement celebrated with the Federal Public Ministry. \n\n3)  Acusações de Ex-Empregado \n\nIn 2013 a former Vale employee accused the company of illegally spying on a number of actors \n\nwho  are  critical  of  its  operations.  The  whistleblower,  who  played  an  important  role  in  the  company’s \n\nsecurity  department,  released  documents  revealing  that  the  company  took  steps  to  infiltrate  social \n\nmovements  that  accompany  affected  communities  in  the  defense  of  their  rights.  According  to  the \n\ndocuments,  the  company  developed  complex  biographical  files  from  information  that  was  allegedly \n\nobtained illegally. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

Vale refuted the \n\nallegations  but  publicly  acknowledged  that  it  monitors  social  organizations.  In  2014,  the  International \n\nFederation of Human Rights conducted a fact-finding mission to Brazil and urged Brazilian authorities \n\nto take measures to prevent Vale from carrying out illegal espionage. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA  Vale  não  reconhece  e  refuta  as  alegações  do  ex-empregado.  As  autoridades  competentes \n\nestão  investigando  o  assunto  e  algumas  investigações  já  foram  arquivadas  devido  à  falta  de \n\ninformações e provas.  \n\nVale’s response \n\nVale  does  not  recognize  and  refute  the  allegations  of  the  former  employee.  The  competent \n\nauthorities are investigating the matter and some investigations were already dismissed due to lack of \n\ninformation and evidence.  \n\n4)  Gestão Ambiental no Sudeste do Pará e no Projeto S11D \n\nTexto do ECA Watch  \n\nThe project is also responsible for the destruction of native forest cover, and for damage to ecosystems \n\nand public health caused by air, soil and water contamination. \n\nResposta Vale  \n\nA Vale protege ou colabora com a proteção de uma área 3,5 vezes maior do que a ocupada por \n\nsuas  operações  globais,  totalizando  13,7  mil  Km²    de  áreas  naturais.  Em  2012,  a  Vale  investiu  US$ \n\n1,025 bilhão em proteção e conservação ambiental, em linha com o valor investido no ano anterior.  \n\nDesde  que  iniciou  a  extração  de  minério  de  ferro  no  sudeste  do  Pará,  em  1985,  a  empresa \n\ncontribui  com  a  preservação  de  mais  de  400  mil  hectares  de  mata  nativa,  através  da  criação  da \n\nFloresta Nacional de Carajás, e da proteção de outras áreas do bioma amazônico, em parceria com o \n\nInstituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio). \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

E  toda  essa  experiência  de  quase  30  anos  está \n\nreunida  no  projeto  S11D,  um  empreendimento  cuidadosamente  planejado  para  atingir  a  excelência \n\noperacional e à manutenção do meio ambiente ecologicamente equilibrado.  \n\nNo  projeto  S11D,  a  preocupação  em  diminuir  os  impactos  ambientais  começa  na  localização \n\nescolhida  para  a  instalação  da  usina  de  processamento  do  minério  de  ferro.  Será  em  uma  área  já \n\nantropizada (com interferência do ser humano) e fora da Floresta Nacional de Carajás.  \n\nCom o mesmo objetivo, de minimizar o impacto na floresta, 70% do ramal ferroviário que levará \n\na  produção  até  a  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás  também  serão  construídos  em  área  de  pastagem.  No \n\ntrecho que  passa  dentro  dos  limites  da  unidade  de  conservação,  serão  construídos  um  túnel  e  uma \n\nponte  para  evitar  impactos  diretos  na  vegetação  e  na  fauna,  com  investimento  adicional  de  R$  200 \n\nmilhões.  \n\nUma vez em operação, o projeto S11D seguirá diversos procedimentos que visam minimizar os \n\nimpactos  ambientais  negativos,  bem  como  maximizar  os \n\nimpactos  positivos  gerados  pelo \n\nempreendimento. . \n\nVale´s response \n\nVale  protects  or  helps  to  protect  an  area  3.5  times  larger  than  that  occupied  by  its  global \n\noperations,  adding  up  to  13,700  km2.  In  2011,  Vale  invested  US$1.030  billion  in  environmental \n\nmonitoring and protection, 40% up on the previous year.  \n\nSince  it  began  mining  iron  ore  in  the  the  Southeast  of  Pará  in  1985,  the  company  has  been \n\nhelping to conserve Carajás National Forest and other areas of the Amazon biome in partnership with \n\nthe Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).  \n\nOver the years, Vale has also developed technologies and management systems that have led \n\nto lower-impact operations. All of this experience gained over more than 30 years is incorporated into \n\nthe S11D project, which has been carefully planned to achieve operational excellence. \n\nIn  the  S11D  project,  Vale’s  concern  to  reduce  environmental  impacts  starts  with  the  location \n\nchosen for the iron ore processing plant: it will be built in an area already affected by mankind outside \n\nCarajás National Forest, thereby avoiding the need for deforestation. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nVALE S.A. - Av.

Through our investments in our assets and the \nlong-term  commitments  we  make  to  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  we  believe  that  our \nglobal  presence  and  economic  strength  contribute  positively  to  socioeconomic  development \nin our host countries. \n\nWe are a major investor in the developing world and we are proud of the difference that our \npresence  can  make.  Many  of  our  investments  are  located  in  challenging  locations  with \ndiverse organisational culture and complex legacy issues. Communities in these areas often \nface restricted access to basic services such as sanitation, water, energy and infrastructure. \nWe undertake and contribute to activities and programmes designed to improve the quality of \nlife for the people in the communities that surround our operations. \n\nIn 2013, we paid US$3.7 billion in royalties and taxes, and a further US$4.3 billion in wages to \nour 200,000 employees and contractors. US$170 million was spent on social investment such \nas healthcare and education. Throughout the world our assets contribute to the building and \nmaintenance  of  roads,  water  infrastructure  and  other  service  development  projects  for  the \nlong-term benefit of the local communities. \n\nOur  corporate  sustainability \nframework  balances  social,  environmental,  ethical  and \ncommercial interests at every level of our group. This framework is called Glencore Corporate \nPractice  (GCP).  We  designed  and  implemented  the  GCP  to  be  in  line  with  internationally \nrecognised,  good  practice,  sector  specific  standards  and  we  continue  to  monitor  its \nperformance to ensure  it  is fit for purpose. Our Code  of Conduct is  an  important part  of the \nGCP and sets out our corporate values and provides clear guidance to our employees about \nhow we do business. \n\nThe Tintaya copper mine located in the Peruvian province of Espinar commenced operations \nin  1985  as  a  state-owned  company.  Following  a  decision  by  the  Peruvian  government  to \nprivatise  the  operation,  Magma  Copper  Co  acquired  the  mine  in  1994  via  an  international \npublic auction. In 1996, Magma Copper was acquired by Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) which, \nin turn, merged with Billiton in 2001 to form BHP Billiton. Xstrata acquired Tintaya from BHP \nBilliton  in  May  2006.  In  May  2013,  Glencore  acquired  Xstrata  and  is  the  current  operator  of \nthe Tintaya-Antapaccay asset. \n\nAt  the  time  of  Xstrata’s  acquisition  of  Tintaya,  the  mine's  Mineral  Resources  were  nearing \ndepletion and  its operations were scheduled to close  in 2013. Xstrata committed substantial \ninvestments  in  exploration  of  the  surrounding  areas  with  a  goal  of  sustaining  mining  and \nmineral  processing  operations  in  Espinar  province  for  the  mutual  benefit  of  the  community \nand the company. \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O.

Today,  the  large-\nscale,  modern  Antapaccay  mining  operation  uses  cutting-edge \nleading \nenvironmental management and  has extended mining operations by  at  least 18  years  at an \nincreased rate of production, generating important economic and social benefits to the Cusco \nregion and specifically to the Espinar province. Tintaya ceased operations in 2013. \n\ntechnology, \n\nThe Framework Agreement \nOver its  years of operation, Tintaya has been the subject of a number of disputes with local \npeople, with protestors overrunning the mine for the first time on 21 May 1990. Since then, 21 \nMay has become a symbolic date for community protests against the operation and protests \ntook  place  on  and  around  this  date  in  2000,  2003,  2005  and  most  recently  in  2012.  The \nprevious  Espinar  Mayor,  Oscar  Mollahuanca,  was  involved  in  the  protests  as  mayor  in  both \n2000 and 2012, and as advisor to the United Defence Front for Espinar Interests (FUDIE) in \n2005.  \n\nIn  2002  a  Dialogue  Table  was  established  to  investigate  community  grievances  on  land \nexpropriation,  environmental  pollution  and  human  rights  with  the  participation  of  six  local \ncommunities  in  the  direct  area  of  influence  of  the  mine,  Tintaya  representatives  and  non-\ngovernmental organisations Oxfam Americas, Conicami and Cooperación.  \n\nOn 3 September 2003, BHP Billiton signed the Framework Agreement with Espinar provincial \nauthorities. Under the Framework Agreement, Tintaya and subsequently  Antapaccay makes \nan annual contribution of 3% of profit before tax to finance social improvement projects for the \nbenefit of over 70 communities in Espinar province among other commitments.  \n\nSince  acquiring the Tintaya mine from BHP Billiton,  Xstrata and subsequently  Glencore has \nfully  met  and  in  many  aspects  gone  beyond  all  its  obligations  under  the  Framework \nAgreement. The company has resolved the grievances that were discussed in the context of \nthe  Dialogue  Table.  As  a  result  it  was  agreed  to  rename  the  Dialogue  Table  as  the \nDevelopment  Table  in  2011,  a  change  that  reflected  how  the  mechanism  has  evolved  from \none  that  managed  liabilities  caused  by  historical  mining  activities  to  one  that  is  focused  on \npromoting  local  development.  Under  our  management,  all  the  grievances  relating  to  land \nexpropriation were resolved and it was agreed to dissolve the working group that addressed \nthis area of grievance.  \n\nThe  Framework  Agreement,  through  which  approximately  70%  of  our  voluntary  investments \nare  made,  is  supervised  by  a  General  Assembly  formed  by  37  organisations.  Tintaya-\nAntapaccay  has  one  representative  on  the  Management  Committee  which  is  comprised  of \neight  people  including  two  local  authorities,  three  civil  society  organisation  and  two  local \ncommunity  representatives.  The  Framework  Agreement  budget  is  divided  between  mega-\nprojects (20%) and district projects (80%). In the latter case, the budget is divided among the \neight  districts  of  Espinar  province  based  on  the  size  of  the  population  (80%)  and  poverty \nindicators  (20%)  of  each  district.  Community  members  then  participate  in  workshops  to \ndecide  which  projects  should  be  implemented  according  to  the  budget.  Since  inception, \nTintaya-Antapaccay  has  contributed  over  US$97million  through  this  mechanism  which  has \nenabled  the  implementation  of  major  infrastructure  projects  such  as  the  Espinar  Hospital,  a \nDairy  Plant,  the  Centre  of  Educational  Resources  of  Espinar  and  recently  an  Alpaca  Fibre \nPlant and has funded more than 800 smaller community projects in the region. \n\nWe have surpassed our commitments under the Framework Agreement to ensure that 70% of \nindirect and direct unskilled labour is drawn from local communities. We have increased local \nemployment  of  unskilled  labour  to  100%  at  the  new  Antapaccay  mine.  As  a  result  of  the \ndedicated training and procurement programs that we have put in place, Tintaya-Antapaccay \nhas  also  facilitated  the  start-up  of  around  70  local  suppliers  that  provide  services  such  as \ncatering, electrical services and maintenance. \n\nSince  acquiring  Tintaya,  we  have  worked  relentlessly  to  ensure  that  the  Framework \nAgreement  is  managed  effectively  and  delivers  sustainable  projects  to  provide  long-term \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fbenefits  for  the  communities  in  Espinar  province.  Since  the  agreement  was  signed  in  2003, \nmore  than  800  projects  agreed  by  the  communities  and  the  Espinar  authorities  have  been \ncompleted, including several large-scale infrastructure projects that benefit several districts of \nthe province. Each of these projects have been identified, developed and implemented by a \nmanagement committee comprising representatives from the Provincial  Municipality (current \nchair)  and  District  Municipalities  of  Espinar,  civil  society  organisations  including  FUDIE  (the \nEspinar  Civil  Society  Interest  Defence  Association),  communities  and  Tintaya-Antapaccay. \nThe  current  structure  provides  an  important  balance  between  government,  non-government \norganisations,  community  representatives  and  the  private  sector  and  has,  we  believe,  been \nan important factor in enabling the Framework Agreement to deliver projects more efficiently \nand effectively than many other social development funds in Peru. \n\nWe  have  continued  to  invest  significantly  in  social  and  community  development.  Since \nacquiring  Tintaya  in  2006,  we  have  voluntarily  contributed  around  US$82  million  under  the \nFramework Agreement and almost US$93 million  in  other donation mechanisms, in addition \nto our substantial tax and royalty payments that total  more than $915 million  over the same \nperiod.  \n\nThe Framework Agreement is an effective and very positive initiative between the company, \nthe Espinar province and its communities, which has been delivering tangible and sustainable \nbenefits  to  local  communities  over  a  number  of  years.  We  continuously  engage  with \ncommunities, representative organisations and the provincial authorities of Espinar to discuss \nhow we can work together to enhance the Framework Agreement. \n\nActive environmental management \nWe  strongly  reject  the  allegations  of  environmental  pollution  by  either  the  Tintaya  or \nAntapaccay mines. Our operations comply in full with all environmental and social regulations. \nOur operations undertake environmental monitoring on a regular basis and  are  subjected to \nboth external and internal audits to evaluate the site’s environmental performance. \n\nIn recent years, there have been two independent environmental studies on the presence of \nheavy metals in the waterways, soils and inhabitants of the catchment area of the Tintaya and \nAntapaccay  mines.  The  first  study  into  community  health  was  conducted  in  2010  by  Peru’s \nregional  health  ministry  (Censopas)  as  part  of  a  baseline  study  into  the  Quechua  mining \nproject, owned by another company, 10 kilometres upstream of the Tintaya mine. The second \nstudy  was  sponsored  by  two  NGOs,  Germany’s  Misereor  and  Peru’s  Vicaría  de  la \nSolidaridad, and conducted by a German student, Eike Hümpel, in 2011. It should be noted \nthat  this  study’s  methodology  was  seriously  flawed  in  that  it  did  not  take  into  account  the \ngeological characteristics of the area, such as the natural background mineralisation present \nin the region, which includes heavy metals.  \n\nNeither report states that Tintaya-Antapaccay is the cause of the presence of heavy metals in \nthe  area.  Both  reports  have  been  misused  by  the  previous  Espinar  Mayor  Oscar \nMollohuanca, non-governmental and civil society organisations and members of the Peruvian \nparliament as proof that Tintaya-Antapaccay is contaminating the environment. This incorrect \nassumption  was  widely  reported  in  the  Peruvian  press  and  undoubtedly  contributed  to \nheightening  tensions  among  local  people  prior  to  the  protests  in  May  2012.  In  fact,  the \nPeruvian  parliament’s  Ethics  Commission  launched  an  inquiry  against  a  Congress  member \nfor using the 2010 study to accuse the Tintaya mine of pollution and she subsequently issued \na retraction.  \n\nThe  Tintaya-Antapaccay  mine  is  located  in  a  naturally  highly-mineralised  area  along  the \nYauri-Andahuaylas copper belt where historical artisan and small-scale mining has occurred \nand  is  still  active.  Tintaya-Antapaccay  operates  a  closed-circuit  water  management  system \nand does not discharge mine water into the environment, although it holds permits to do so. \nTintaya-Antapaccay does not use, or mine, lead, arsenic or mercury at its operations.  \n\nOur environmental performance is subject to numerous internal and external audits. Peruvian \nregulatory  organisations  (previously  Osinergmin,  a  state  organisation  responsible  for \nsupervising  mining  and  energy  investments,  and  now  Peru’s  environmental  audit  and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fevaluation  organisation  OEFA)  have  taken  hundreds  of  samples  and  conducted  several \nmonitoring programs as part of their audit faculties in recent years and found no evidence of \npollution. All regulatory and participatory monitoring activities to date have demonstrated that \nTintaya-Antapaccay  operates  in  line  with  Peruvian  law  and  we  have  always  rejected \nallegations of environmental pollution at our Tintaya-Antapaccay operations. \n\nRegardless of location, we always aim to secure broad-based support for our activities. This \nwas  evidenced  by  the  overwhelming  community  support  we  received  during  the  public \nconsultation  process \nImpact \nAssessment. Today, Tintaya-Antapaccay undertakes participatory monitoring of its operations \nand the surrounding areas with the community and the Peruvian authorities.  \n\nthe  Antapaccay  expansion  project’s  Environmental \n\nfor \n\n2012 social unrest \nWe were deeply concerned that the protests in Espinar escalated into violence at the end of \nMay  2012.  At  the  time,  Tintaya-Antapaccay  advised  Mayor  Mollohuanca  that,  although  it \nwould  be  unable  to  meet  his  demand  to  increase  our  contribution  under  the  Framework \nAgreement to 30% from 3%, it was open to discussing enhancements to the agreement, for \nexample  by  increasing  commitments  to  hire  local  people  at  our  operations.  Despite  these \nattempts to maintain a dialogue with the communities and reach a peaceful solution, and the \nnational  government’s  prior  agreement  to  conduct  further  intensive  joint  environmental \nmonitoring in the province, the protests went ahead.  \n\nDuring  the  protests,  we  were  highly  concerned  for  the  safety  of  our  employees  and \ncontractors  in  the  region  and  of  the  local  communities  of  Espinar.  We  do  not  condone \nviolence of any kind and we are committed to respecting the human rights of our employees \nand community members in the region. \n\nWe  are  deeply  committed  to  respecting  human  rights.  Wherever  we  operate,  we  engage \nactively  with host communities to build constructive  dialogue, and pay  particular  attention to \nminimising  any  risk  of  human  rights  abuses  by  our  employees,  contractors,  or  security \nproviders.  At  our  sites  operating  in  regions  considered  to  be  high  risk,  we  use  the  United \nNations  Voluntary  Principles  on  Security  and  Human  Rights  (Voluntary  Principles)  to  guide \nthe  use  of  private  security  and  the  interaction  with  public  service  personnel.  Our  risk \nassessment and training methodologies are aligned with the Voluntary Principles. We actively \nengage  with  host  governments  to  raise  awareness  of  the  Voluntary  Principles  as  an \ninternational best practice standard in the area of security and human rights.  \n\nAll of our sites are required to conduct  human rights  risk assessments that are  aligned  with \nthe Voluntary Principles. For sites located in regions considered to be high-risk, such as Peru, \nhuman rights risk assessments take place on an annual basis; this approach is undertaken at \nTintaya-Antapaccay.    In  addition,  Tintaya-  Antapaccay  has  actively  engaged  with  Socios \nPerú, a local multi-stakeholder network working with the government to promote the Voluntary \nPrinciples, to share learnings and best practices with other operators in the country.  \n\nWe  incorporated  human  rights  into  the  initial  project  risk  assessment  for  the  Antapaccay \nexpansion project. This risk assessment included a review of the strength of the rule of law, \nthe potential for conflict and the challenges and potential impacts for local communities.  \n\nAs part  of our commitment to human rights,  all of our employee and contractors at  Tintaya-\nAntapaccay  receive  training  on  human  rights.  To  date  over  5,000  people,  including \nconstruction  contractors  at  the  Antapaccay  expansion  project,  have  participated  in  human \nrights awareness programmes. All security personnel working at Tintaya-Antapaccay receive \ntraining on our internal policies and procedures for human rights.  \n\nRelationship with the police \nThe  authors  of  the  Corporate  Conquistadors  report  have  fundamentally  misunderstood  the \nrelationship  between  Tintaya-Antapaccay  and  the  Policía  Nacional  del  Perú  (PNP).  It  is \nincorrect  to  state  that  the  PNP  acted  as  the  company’s  private  security  force  or  acted  on \nbehalf  of  the  company  during  the  May  2012  protests.  The  PNP  was  at  all  times  during  the \nMay  2012  protests  operating  under  its  own  chain  of  command  and  under  the  control  and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fauthority of the Peruvian Government. Tintaya-Antapaccay did not seek to (and, in any event, \nwould not be able to) exercise any direction over the PNP’s response to the protests. \n\nWhilst the Corporate Conquistadors report is correct to note that there was an agreement in \nplace  between  the  PNP  and  the  company,  dated  16  May  2011,  it  is  clear  that  neither  the \nauthors of the report, nor the authors of the report entitled “Mercenary Police at the service of \nMining  corporations”  cited  as  support  in  footnote  16,  have  had  sight  of  the  relevant \nagreement.  Accordingly,  none  of  those  authors  are  in  a  position  properly  to  understand  or \nspeak to the content or purpose of that agreement. We have clarified the nature and scope of \nthat agreement below. \n\nThe agreement was executed pursuant to Peruvian law, the Supreme Decree No. 019-71-IN, \nNo.053-2005-PCM,  Decree  Law  25707  and  Law  28305,  No.  086-92-PCM,  which  was \napproved by Supreme Decree 053-2005-PCM. In accordance with those laws, the agreement \nprovided  for  extraordinary  supplementary  police  services  in  matters  of  surveillance  and \nsafety,  inspection  and  control  of  controlled  chemical  materials  and  other  services  in  the \nTintaya mining camp. These services  were necessary  due to some of the materials used in \nthe mines’ operations, such as sulphuric acid, having the potential to make illegal substances, \nincluding explosives.  \n\nThe agreement  also makes specific reference to  the  company’s adherence to the  Voluntary \nPrinciples  and  expressed  the  expectation  that  the  PNP  assigned  to  the  Tintaya  mine  would \nmake  the  same  commitment  to  those  Principles.  Any  suggestion  that  this  agreement \nfacilitated  “the  criminalisation  of  protest  by  allowing  police  to  make  arbitrary  arrests,  torture \nhuman rights defenders and journalists” and constitutes “a systematic abuse of power”, as per \npage  14  of  the  report,  is  simply  erroneous  and  fails  to  take  any  account  whatsoever  of  the \ntrue nature of this agreement. In any event, we note that the report has misquoted the Inter \nAmerican Commission on Human Rights in this respect. The Commission was in fact referring \nto the violation of the State of Emergency laws by the Peruvian government, which is clearly \nnothing to do with the agreement or the company. \n\nWe  strongly  deny  any  suggestion  that  Glencore  has  little  regard  for  the  human  rights  of \nEspinar’s  people  or  that  the  company  has  enjoyed  the  protection  of  public  services  of  the \nPNP  to  repress  groups  that  reject  our  projects  and  demand  compliance  with  human  rights \nnorms.  We  respect  the  rights  of  our  stakeholders  to  voice  their  concerns  regarding  our \nprojects  in  a  non-violent  way.  We  have  in  no  way  acted  to  prevent  demonstrations  taking \nplace  at  our  operations. We  remain  committed  to  engaging  in  constructive  dialogue  with  all \nour  stakeholders  to  address  any  concerns  and  to  ensure  our  activities  and  significant \ninvestments continue to contribute to the long-term social and economic development of the \nprovince for the benefit of all. \n\nCoal  \nGlencore  recognises  that  climate  change  issues  are  part  of  the  political,  societal  and \nregulatory  landscape  in  which  we  operate.  We  believe  that  effective  climate  change  policy \nmust be informed by the realities of global energy demand and supply and balance the social \nand economic aspirations of countries and their citizens. \n\nWe recognise that energy is one of the fundamental building blocks of modern life and a key \nenabler  of  economic  and  social  progress.  The  need  for  access  to  secure,  reliable  and \naffordable energy is universal. \n\nGlencore is a member of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network (AIGN) whose stated \naim is to  \n\n“AIGN is a network of industry associations and individual businesses which \ncontribute to the climate change policy debate and see value in joint industry action \non climate change in order to promote sustainable industry development.” \n\nThe  AIGN  is  one  of  a  range  of  industry  stakeholders  which  provides  feedback  and \nsuggestions to Government on the topic of climate change.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\fWe object to the allegation that prior to its acquisition by Glencore, Xstrata Australia was part \nof the self-proclaimed ‘greenhouse mafia’. Xstrata never claimed to be part of any so called \n‘greenhouse mafia’, we consider this to be a derogative term was used by a member of the \nGreens party and a journalist in Australia. \n\nLike  many  companies  with  a  presence  in  Australia,  Xstrata  participated  in  public  policy \ndiscussions in Australia on the topic of climate change, carbon pricing and renewable energy \ntargets.  On  a  number  of  occasions,  Xstrata  expressed  valid  concerns  about  the  design  of \nproposed  policies  in  Australia  (CPRS  and  CEA)  and  the  potential  for  carbon  leakage  and \nnegative impacts on Australia’s trade competitiveness.  \n\nThe comments attributed to Xstrata Coal’s senior management team have been taken out of \ncontext  and  are  a  misrepresentation  of  their  views.  Peter  Freyberg’s  statement  that  taking \naction  on  coal  would  “cost  jobs  and  move  investment  offshore”  was  made  to  support  his \nthoughts on the possible negative impacts of a poorly and/or flawed designed climate change \npolicy. Mr Coates was one of a number of senior business people and stakeholders asked to \nprovide  feedback  to  the  Australian  Government  on  climate  change  matters.  It  is  totally \nincorrect  of  the  report  to  claim  that  Mr  Coates  “warned”  the  government  away  from  climate \nleadership. \n\nGlencore  is  a  member  of  a  number  of  industry  associations,  which  are  disclosed  on  its \nwebsite.  These  organisations  promote  the  view  of  industry,  providing  decision-makers  with \nthe opportunity to hear all sides of the story. Both Glencore and Xstrata have been present at \na  number  of  UNFCCC  Climate  Talks  over  the  years  as  a  legitimate  participant  and  an \nobserver of UNFCCC discussions. These talks are conducted in a public forum, are open to \nany  registered  delegate  either  as  a  company  or  as  a  member  of  a  recognised  industry \nassociation and are freely reported on by the media.  \n\nCarbon Capture and Storage  (CCS) is recognised by the International Energy Agency (IEA) \nas  an  important  low  emission  technology  that  will  be  required  to  significantly  reduce  global \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions.  It  is  entirely  appropriate  for  Glencore  to  support  the  further \ndevelopment and deployment of CCS technology. \n\nWe are disappointed by the incorrect claims made by the report, implying that Glencore is \n“actively and aggressively lobbying for false solutions to climate change through its myriad of \nshady lobby groups”. We have been and continue to be a constructive and informed \nparticipant on climate change policy issues. We take a legitimate interest in policy \ndevelopments on climate change and the potential impact these may have on our business, \nincluding from a compliance perspective. Our membership and presence in these discussions \nis transparent as are any submissions we make on these issues or comments made in our \npublic reporting."}

Realizamos  muchas  de  nuestras  inversiones  en \nlugares que presentan desafíos difíciles, con culturas organizacionales diversas y complejos \nproblemas  heredados  del  pasado.  Las  comunidades  que  habitan  esas  regiones  suelen \nenfrentar un acceso restringido a los servicios básicos, como saneamiento, agua, energía e \ninfraestructura. Emprendemos y apoyamos actividades y programas diseñados para mejorar \nla  calidad  de  vida  de  las  personas  que  habitan  en  las  comunidades  aledañas  a  nuestras \noperaciones. \n\nEn  2013,  pagamos USD  3.700 millones por concepto de regalías e  impuestos  y otros USD \n4.300  millones  en  salarios  a  nuestros  200.000  trabajadores  propios  y  contratistas. \nEfectuamos una inversión social de USD 170 millones en iniciativas de salud y educación.

Tras  la  decisión  del  Estado  peruano  de \nprivatizar  esta  operación,  Magma  Copper  Co  adquirió  la  mina  en  1994  por  medio  de  una \nsubasta  pública  internacional.  En  1996,  Magma  Copper  fue  adquirida  por  Broken  Hill \nProprietary (BHP), empresa que, a su vez, se fusionó con Billiton en 2001 y que dio origen a \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O. Box, CH-6341 Baar, Switzerland \nT +41 41 709 20 00F +41 41 709 30 00 www.glencore.com \nRegistered in Jersey with number 107710 \nRegistered address: Queensway House, Hilgrove Street, St Helier, Jersey JE1 1ES \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fBHP Billiton. En mayo de 2006, Xstrata adquirió Tintaya de BHP Billiton. En mayo de 2013, \nGlencore adquirió Xstrata y es el actual operador del activo Tintaya-Antapaccay. \n\nAl momento de la compra de Tintaya por parte de Xstrata, los recursos minerales de la mina \nestaban  casi  agotados  y  se  había  previsto  el  cierre  de  sus  operaciones  para  2013.  Xstrata \ndestinó considerables inversiones a la exploración de las zonas aledañas con el objetivo de \nmantener  las  operaciones  de  explotación  y  procesamiento  de  mineral  en  la  provincia  de \nEspinar para el beneficio mutuo de la comunidad y la empresa. \n\nEn  2010,  el directorio de  Xstrata aprobó  una inversión  de  $1.470 millones para prolongar  y \nampliar  las  operaciones  por  medio  del  desarrollo  del  yacimiento  satélite  Antapaccay. \nActualmente, la moderna operación minera, de gran escala, Antapaccay, emplea tecnología \nde punta, aplica una gestión ambiental líder y ha prolongado las operaciones mineras en, al \nmenos,  18  años  a  una  mayor  tasa  de  producción,  lo  que  genera  importantes  beneficios \neconómicos  y  sociales  para  la  región  del  Cusco  y  específicamente  la  provincia  de  Espinar. \nTintaya cesó sus actividades en 2013. \n\nEl Convenio Marco \nDurante sus años de operación, Tintaya fue objeto de una serie de conflictos con pobladores \nlocales;  el  21  de  mayo  1990,  manifestantes  invadieron  el  campamento  minero  por  primera \nvez. Desde entonces, el 21 mayo se ha convertido en una fecha simbólica para las protestas \nde  los  pobladores  en  contra  de  la  operación  minera  y  en  esa  fecha  o  en  torno  a  ella  se \nsuscitaron  protestas  en  los  años  2000,  2003  y  2005  y  más  recientemente,  en  2012.  El \nanterior alcalde de Espinar, Sr. Oscar Mollohuanca, participó en las protestas de 2000 y 2012 \ncomo  alcalde  y  de  2005  como  asesor  del  Frente  Único  de  Defensa  de  los  Intereses  de \nEspinar (FUDIE). \n\nEn  2002,  se  instauró  una  mesa  de  diálogo  para  investigar  los  reclamos  de  la  comunidad \nsobre  expropiación  de  tierras,  contaminación  ambiental  y  derechos  humanos.  La  mesa \nestuvo  integrada  por  representantes  de  seis  comunidades  locales  del  área  de  influencia \ndirecta de la mina, de Tintaya y de las organizaciones no gubernamentales Oxfam Americas, \nConicami y Cooperacción. \n\nEl  3  septiembre  de  2003,  BHP  Billiton  suscribió  el  Convenio  Marco  con  las  autoridades \nprovinciales  de  Espinar.  En  virtud  de  este  convenio,  Tintaya  y  posteriormente  Antapaccay \nrealiza  una  contribución  anual  del  3%  de  sus  utilidades  antes  de  impuestos  para  el \nfinanciamiento de proyectos de mejoramiento social, en beneficio de las 70 comunidades de \nla provincia de Espinar, entre otros compromisos. \n\nDesde la adquisición de mina Tintaya a BHP Billiton, Xstrata, y posteriormente Glencore, ha \ncumplido  plenamente  con  sus  obligaciones  en  virtud  del  convenio  marco  y,  en  muchos \naspectos,  incluso  con  obligaciones  más  estrictas  que  las  estipuladas  en  el  convenio.    La \nempresa  dio  solución  a  los  reclamos  discutidos  en  el  marco  de  la  Mesa  de  Diálogo.  Como \nresultado de ello, en 2011, se acordó cambiar el nombre de la Mesa de Diálogo  a Mesa de \nDesarrollo, un cambio que reflejó la transición de un mecanismo abocado a gestionar pasivos \noriginados por actividades mineras históricas a uno dedicado a promover el desarrollo local. \nBajo nuestra gestión, se resolvieron todas las quejas  relativas a expropiación de tierras y se \nacordó disolver la comisión conformada para abordar los reclamos sobre esta materia.  \n\nEl  Convenio  Marco,  en  virtud  del  cual  se  realizan  cerca  del  70%  de  nuestros  aportes \nvoluntarios, es supervisado por una asamblea general conformada por 37 organizaciones. En \nel  comité  de  gestión,  que  consta  de  ocho  integrantes,  Tintaya-Antapaccay  posee  un \nrepresentante,  hay  dos  autoridades  locales,  tres  representantes  de  organizaciones  de  la \nsociedad civil y dos de la comunidad local. El presupuesto del Convenio Marco se distribuye \nentre megaproyectos (20%) y proyectos de distrito (80%). En el último caso, el presupuesto \nse  divide  entre  los  ocho  distritos  que  conforman  la  provincia  de  Espinar  sobre  la  base  del \ntamaño de la población (80%) y de los indicadores de pobreza (30%) de cada distrito. Luego, \nlos  miembros  de  la  comunidad  participan  en  talleres  para  decidir  qué  proyectos  deberían \nimplementarse  conforme  al  presupuesto.  Desde  su  creación,  Tintaya  Antapaccay  ha \naportado  más  de  USD  97  millones  por  medio  de  este  mecanismo,  que  ha  permitido \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fimplementar importantes proyectos de infraestructura, tales como el hospital de Espinar, una \nplanta de lácteos, el Centro de Recursos Educativos de Espinar y, recientemente, una planta \nprocesadora de fibra de alpaca. Además, ha financiado más de 800 proyectos comunitarios \nde menor tamaño en la región. \n\nSuperamos  los  compromisos  asumidos  en  virtud  del  Convenio  Marco  para  permitir  que  el \n70%  de  la  mano  de  obra  no  calificada,  tanto  directa  como  directa,  provenga  de  las \ncomunidades locales. En la nueva mina Antapaccay, aumentamos la utilización de mano de \nobra local no calificada a un 100%. Gracias a los programas de capacitación y adquisiciones \nque hemos dispuesto, Tintaya-Antapaccay también ha facilitado el lanzamiento de cerca de \n70 proveedores locales que prestan servicios, tales como catering, instalaciones eléctricas y \nmantenimiento. \n\nDesde la adquisición de Tintaya, nos hemos abocado sin cesar a velar por que el Convenio \nMarco  sea  gestionado  de  manera  eficaz  y  genere  proyectos  sostenibles  para  proporcionar \nbeneficios de largo plazo a las comunidades ubicadas en la provincia de Espinar. Desde la \nsuscripción  del acuerdo, en 2003, se han concretado más de 800 proyectos  acordados por \nlas  comunidades  y  las  autoridades  de  Espinar,  entre  ellos,  diversos  proyectos  de \ninfraestructura, de gran escala, que benefician a una serie de distritos de la provincia. Cada \nuno  de  estos  proyectos  fueron  definidos,  desarrollados  e  implementados  por  un  comité  de \ngestión  conformado  por  representantes  de  la  municipalidad  provincial  (que  lo  preside \nactualmente) y las municipalidades distritales de Espinar, organizaciones de la sociedad civil, \nentre ellas, FUDIE (Frente Único de Defensa de los Intereses de Espinar), las comunidades y \nTintaya-Antapaccay. La estructura actual asegura un  punto de equilibrio  importante entre  el \ngobierno,  las  organizaciones  no  gubernamentales,  los  representantes  de  la  comunidad  y  el \nsector  privado  y  —creemos—  ha  sido  un  factor  importante  para  que  el  Convenio  Marco \nejecute  los  proyectos  de  manera  más  eficiente  y  eficaz  que  muchos  otros  fondos  de \ndesarrollo social en Perú. \n\nHemos  seguido  efectuando  inversiones  significativas  en  desarrollo  social  y  comunitario. \nDesde  nuestra  adquisición  de  Tintaya,  en  2006,  hemos  efectuado  aportes  voluntarios \ncercanos  a  USD  82  millones  en  virtud  del  Convenio  Marco  y  de  casi  USD  93  millones \nmediante  otros  mecanismos  de  donación,  además  de  realizar  pagos  sustanciales  por \nconcepto de impuestos y regalías, que suman más de $915 millones para el mismo período.  \n\nEl Convenio  Marco es una iniciativa eficaz  y muy positiva entre la empresa, la  provincia de \nEspinar  y  las  comunidades,  que  ha  generado  beneficios  tangibles  y  sostenibles  para  las \ncomunidades locales durante varios años. Dialogamos continuamente con las comunidades, \nlas organizaciones representativas y las autoridades provinciales de Espinar para abordar la \nmanera de colaborar en pos del mejoramiento del Convenio Marco. \n\nUna activa gestión ambiental  \nRechazamos categóricamente las acusaciones de contaminación ambiental en contra de las \nminas  Tintaya  o  Antapaccay.  Nuestras  operaciones  cumplen  plenamente  con  todas  las \nnormativas  ambientales  y  sociales.  Nuestras  operaciones  realizan  monitoreos  ambientales \nde  manera  periódica  y  se  someten  a  auditorías,  tanto  internas  como  externas,  con  el \npropósito de evaluar el desempeño ambiental de nuestras instalaciones. \n\nMedio \n\nEn los últimos años, se han realizado dos estudios ambientales independientes para analizar \nla presencia de metales pesados en  los cursos de aguas,  suelos  y  habitantes  de las  zonas \nde  captación  de  las  minas  Tintaya  y  Antapaccay.  El  primer  estudio  sobre  salud  de  la \ncomunidad fue realizado, en 2010, por el Centro Nacional de Salud Ocupacional y Protección \nSalud \ndel \n(Censopas) del Instituto Nacional de Salud de Perú,  en el marco de un estudio de línea  de \nbase  del  proyecto  minero  Quechua,  propiedad  de  otra  empresa,  situado  a  10  km  aguas \narriba  de  mina  Tintaya.  El  segundo  estudio  fue  patrocinado  por  dos  ONG,  la  alemana \nMisereor  y  la  Vicaría  de  la  Solidaridad  de  Perú,  y  fue  realizado  por  la  estudiante  alemana \nEike Hümpel en 2011. Debe señalarse que la metodología aplicada en este estudio presenta \ngraves  defectos  y  no  considera  las  características  geológicas  de  la  zona,  tales  como  la \n\nAmbiente \n\npara \n\nla \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fmineralización  propia  de  las  condiciones  naturales  de  la  región,  que  incluye  metales \npesados.  \n\nNinguno  de  los  informes  afirma  que  Tintaya-Antapaccay  sea  causante  de  la  presencia  de \nmetales pesados en el área. Ambos informes fueron mal utilizados por el alcalde anterior de \nEspinar,  Sr.  Oscar  Mollohuanca,  por  organizaciones  no  gubernamentales  y  de  la  sociedad \ncivil  y  por  miembros  del  parlamento  peruano  como  prueba  de  que  Tintaya-Antapaccay \ncontamina el medio ambiente. Este supuesto erróneo fue difundido ampliamente en la prensa \nperuana y sin duda alguna contribuyó a recrudecer las tensiones entre los pobladores locales \nantes  de  las  protestas  de  mayo  de  2012.  De  hecho,  la  comisión  de  ética  del  Congreso  del \nPerú lanzó una investigación en contra de una parlamentaria por utilizar el estudio de 2010 \npara acusar a mina Tintaya de contaminación, parlamentaria que posteriormente debió emitir \nuna retractación.  \n\nLa mina Tintaya-Antapaccay está situada en una zona que presenta en forma natural suelos \naltamente mineralizados, pues se encuentra sobre la faja de cobre Yauri-Andahuaylas, en la \ncual se ha realizado  minería artesanal  y  pequeña minería  desde tiempos ancestrales hasta \nhoy.  Tintaya  Antapaccay  utiliza  un  sistema  de  circuito  cerrado  para  la  gestión  del  recurso \nhídrico y no vierte agua de la mina al medio ambiente, si bien está autorizada para hacerlo. \nTintaya Antapaccay no utiliza ni extrae plomo, arsénico o mercurio en sus operaciones.  \n\nSometemos nuestro desempeño ambiental a numerosas auditorías internas  y externas. Los \norganismos  reguladores  peruanos  (anteriormente,  Osinergmin,  una  institución  pública \nencargada de supervisar las inversiones en los sectores de minería y energía y, actualmente, \nOEFA,  el  organismo  de  evaluación  y  fiscalización  ambiental  de  Perú),  en  los  últimos  años, \nhan tomado cientos de  muestras  y realizado diversos programas de monitoreo  en el marco \nde  sus  facultades  fiscalizadoras  y  no  han  detectado  ninguna  evidencia  de  contaminación. \nHasta  la  fecha,  todas  las  actividades  de  monitoreo  reglamentarias  y  participativas  han \ndemostrado  que  Tintaya-Antapaccay  opera  conforme  a  la  legislación  peruana  y  siempre \nhemos  rechazado  las  acusaciones  de  contaminación  ambiental  en  contra  de  nuestras \noperaciones Tintaya-Antapaccay. \n\nIndependientemente  del  lugar,  siempre  procuramos  garantizar  un  amplio  apoyo  para \nnuestras  actividades.  Ello  quedó  demostrado  en  el  contundente  apoyo  comunitario  que \nrecibimos  con  ocasión  del  proceso  de  consulta  pública  sobre  la  evaluación  de  impacto \nambiental del proyecto de ampliación de Antapaccay. Actualmente, Tintaya-Antapaccay lleva \na cabo un monitoreo participativo de sus operaciones y sectores aledaños con la comunidad \ny las autoridades peruanas.  \n\nLas tensiones sociales de 2012 \nEstábamos fuertemente preocupados por la escalada de los actos de protesta en hechos de \nviolencia en Espinar a fines de mayo de 2012. En ese entonces, Tintaya-Antapaccay señaló \nal alcalde Mollohuanca que, si bien no le era posible cumplir con la demanda de aumentar su \naporte en virtud del convenio marco de un 3% a un 30%, estaba abierta a discutir mejoras al \nconvenio, por ejemplo, en materia del aumento del compromiso de contratación de personas \nlocales  en  nuestras  operaciones.  Pese  a  estos  intentos  de  mantener  el  diálogo  con  las \ncomunidades  y  lograr  una  solución  pacífica,  y  al  acuerdo  previo  del  gobierno  nacional  de \nrealizar  otro  monitoreo  ambiental  conjunto  intensivo  en  la  provincia,  las  protestas  siguieron \nadelante.  \n\nDurante  las  protestas  nos  preocupó  fuertemente  la  seguridad  de  nuestros  trabajadores \npropios  y  contratistas  en  la  región  y  de  las  comunidades  locales  de  Espinar.  No  toleramos \nninguna  forma  de  violencia  y  estamos  comprometidos  con  el  respeto  a  los  derechos \nhumanos de nuestros trabajadores y miembros de la comunidad en la región. \n\nEstamos  profundamente  comprometidos  con  el  respeto  a  los  derechos  humanos.  En  todos \nlos  lugares  en  que  ejercemos  nuestro  quehacer,  nos  relacionamos  activamente  con  las \ncomunidades  locales  con  el  fin  de  entablar  un  diálogo  constructivo  y  prestamos  especial \natención  a  minimizar  todo  riesgo  de  abuso  a  los  derechos  humanos  por  parte  de  nuestros \ntrabajadores  propios,  contratistas  o  proveedores  de  servicios  de  seguridad.  En  nuestras \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\finstalaciones  situadas  en  regiones  consideradas  de  alto  riesgo,  aplicamos  los  Principios \nVoluntarios  de  Seguridad  y  Derechos  Humanos  de  las  Naciones  Unidas  (Principios \nVoluntarios) como guía para el uso de servicios de seguridad privada y la interacción con el \npersonal de servicio público. Las metodologías que aplicamos para la evaluación de riesgos \nlos  Principios  Voluntarios.  Dialogamos \ny  capacitación  se  encuentran  en \nactivamente con los gobiernos locales para  sensibilizar acerca de los  Principios  Voluntarios \ncomo una norma de buena práctica internacional en el ámbito de la seguridad y los derechos \nhumanos. \n\nlínea  con \n\nExigimos a todas nuestras instalaciones realizar evaluaciones de riesgo  sobre los derechos \nhumanos que estén en línea con  los  Principios  Voluntarios.  En  el caso de  las  instalaciones \nsituadas  en  regiones  consideradas  de  alto  riesgo,  como  Perú,  las  evaluaciones  de  riesgo \nsobre  derechos  humanos  se  realizan  anualmente;  este  es  el  enfoque  aplicado  en  Tintaya-\nAntapaccay.    Además,  Tintaya-Antapaccay  colabora  activamente  con  Socios  Perú,  una  red \nlocal conformada por diversas organizaciones que trabaja con el gobierno para promover los \nPrincipios  Voluntarios,  compartir  aprendizajes  y  mejores  prácticas  con  otros  actores  en  el \npaís.  \n\nIncorporamos los derechos humanos a la evaluación inicial de riesgos asociados al proyecto \nefectuada  para  el  proyecto  de  ampliación  de  Antapaccay.  La  evaluación  de  riesgos \ncontempló  una  revisión  de  la  fuerza  del  Estado  de  Derecho,  el  potencial  de  conflicto  y  los \ndesafíos y posibles impactos para las comunidades locales. \n\nComo parte de nuestro compromiso con los derechos humanos, todos nuestros trabajadores \npropios  y  contratistas  de  Tintaya-Antapaccay  reciben  capacitación  en  derechos  humanos. \nHasta  la  fecha,  más  de  5000  personas,  entre  ellas,  contratistas  de  la  construcción  del \nproyecto de ampliación de Antapaccay,  han participado en programas de sensibilización en \nderechos humanos. Todo el personal de seguridad que labora en Tintaya-Antapaccay recibe \nformación  sobre  nuestras  políticas  y  procedimientos  internos  en  materia  de  derechos \nhumanos. \n\nNuestra relación con la policía \nLos  autores  del \ninforme  Conquistadores  corporativos  han  entendido  de  manera \nprofundamente  equivocada  la  relación  que  existe  entre  Tintaya-Antapaccay  y  la  Policía \nNacional  del  Perú  (PNP).  Es  incorrecto  afirmar  que  la  PNP  actuó  como  la  fuerza  de \nseguridad privada de la empresa o en representación de la empresa durante las protestas de \nmayo de 2012. En todo momento durante las protestas de mayo 2012, la PNP actuó bajo las \nórdenes  de  su  cadena  de  mando  y  bajo  el  control  y  la  autoridad  del  gobierno  peruano. \nTintaya Antapaccay no intentó dirigir (y, en cualquier caso, no tendría la capacidad para ello) \nla respuesta de la PNP en las protestas. \n\nSi bien el informe Conquistadores corporativos es correcto en señalar que existía un acuerdo \nentre la PNP y la empresa de fecha 16 mayo  de 2011, es claro que ni los autores de dicho \ninforme,  ni  los  autores  del  informe  titulado  “Policía  Mercenaria  al  Servicio  de  las  Empresas \nMineras” (citado en la nota 16 al pie de página), tuvieron a la vista el acuerdo pertinente. En \nconsecuencia, ninguno de los autores mencionados se encuentra en una posición adecuada \npara  comprender  o  referirse  al  contenido  o  propósito  de  dicho  acuerdo.  A  continuación, \nclarificamos la naturaleza y el alcance de dicho acuerdo. \n\nEl acuerdo se ejecutó en concordancia con la ley peruana, el Decreto Supremo N° 019-71/IN, \nel  Decreto  Supremo  N°  053-2005-PCM,  el  Decreto  Ley  N°  25707  y  la  Ley  N°  28305,  el \nDecreto  Supremo  N°086-92-PCM,  aprobado  por  el  Decreto  Supremo  N°053-2005-PCM.  En \nconcordancia  con  dichas  disposiciones  legales,  el  acuerdo  contemplaba  servicios  policiales \ncomplementarios  extraordinarios  en  asuntos  de  vigilancia  y  seguridad,  inspección  y  control \nde  materiales  químicos  controlados  y  otros  servicios  en  el  campamento  minero  Tintaya. \nEstos  servicios  eran  necesarios  debido  a  que  algunos  de  los  materiales  utilizados  en  las \noperaciones  de  las  minas,  tales  como  el  ácido  sulfúrico,  podían  utilizarse  para  fabricar \nsustancias ilegales, entre ellas, explosivos.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEste  acuerdo  también  efectúa  una  referencia  específica  a  la  adhesión  de  la  empresa  a  los \nPrincipios Voluntarios y expresa el deseo de que la PNP asignada a mina Tintaya asuma el \nmismo  compromiso  con  dichos  principios.  Cualquier  sugerencia  respecto  de  que  este \nacuerdo  haya  servido  “para  criminalizar  la  protesta,  pues  permite  a  la  policía  hacer \ndetenciones arbitrarias, torturas a defensores y periodistas”, y constituya “un sistemático uso \nabusivo  de  la  fuerza”,  tal  como  se  señala  en  la  página  14  del  informe,  es  simplemente \nequivocado  y  no  tiene  cuenta  alguna  de  la  verdadera  naturaleza  de  este  acuerdo.    En \ncualquier  caso,  observamos  que  el \nla  Comisión \nInteramericana de Derechos Humanos en esta materia. La Comisión se refería, de hecho, a \nla violación de la legislación del estado de emergencia por parte del Estado peruano, lo que \nclaramente no tiene que ver con el acuerdo o con la empresa. \n\nincorrectamente  a \n\ninforme  cita \n\nNegamos enérgicamente toda sugerencia de que Glencore tenga poca consideración de los \nderechos  humanos  de  los  pobladores  de  Espinar  o  que  la  empresa  haya  disfrutado  de  la \nprotección  de  los  servicios  públicos  por  parte  de  la  PNP  para  reprimir  a  los  grupos  que \nrechazan  nuestros  proyectos  y  demandan  el  cumplimiento  de  las  normas  de  derechos \nhumanos.  Respetamos  los  derechos  de  nuestros  grupos  de  interés  de  expresar  sus \ninquietudes  sobre  nuestros  proyectos  de  manera  no  violenta.  No  intervenimos  de  manera \nalguna para impedir las manifestaciones que ocurrían en nuestras operaciones. Mantenemos \nnuestro  compromiso  de  entablar  un  diálogo  constructivo  con  todos  nuestros  grupos  de \ninterés  para responder a las inquietudes  y asegurar  que  nuestras  actividades e inversiones \nsignificativas  continúen  contribuyendo  al  desarrollo  social  y  económico  de  largo  plazo  de  la \nprovincia para el beneficio de todos. \n\nEl carbón \nGlencore reconoce que  los desafíos relativos  al cambio climático forman parte del contexto \npolítico, social y regulatorio en el que debe desenvolverse. Creemos que una política eficaz \nen  materia  de  cambio  climático  debe  fundarse  en  las  realidades  de  la  oferta  y  la  demanda \nmundial  de  energía  y  encontrar  un  justo  equilibrio  entre  las  aspiraciones  sociales  y \neconómicas de los países y sus ciudadanos. \n\nReconocemos que la energía es uno de los componentes fundamentales de la vida moderna \ny un catalizador clave del progreso económico  y social. La necesidad de acceder a fuentes \nde energía seguras, confiables y a un costo abordable es universal. \n\nGlencore es miembro de la Australian Industry Greenhouse Network (AIGN o red australiana \nde la industria para reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero), la cual ha \ndeclarado el siguiente propósito:  \n\n“AIGN es una red de asociaciones de la industria y empresas individuales, que \ncontribuye al debate acerca de las políticas sobre cambio climático y que aprecia el \nvalor de una acción conjunta de la industria en materia de cambio climático con el fin \nde promover un desarrollo sostenible de la industria”. \n\nAIGN  es  uno  de  los  numerosos  actores  de  la  industria  que  efectúan  observaciones  y \nsugerencias al gobierno respecto del cambio climático.  \n\nRechazamos  la  acusación  de  que,  previamente  a  ser  adquirida  por  Glencore,  Xstrata \nAustralia haya sido parte del grupo autoproclamado como “Greenhouse Mafia” (la mafia del \nefecto  invernadero).  Xstrata  nunca  ha  afirmado  ser  parte  de  ningún  grupo  denominado \n“Greenhouse Mafia”. Nos parece que ese es un término despectivo, que fue utilizado por un \nmiembro del partido Greens y un periodista en Australia. \n\nComo  muchas  empresas  con  presencia  en  Australia,  Xstrata  participó  en  el  debate  sobre \npolíticas  públicas  en  Australia  en  materia  de  las  metas  sobre  el  cambio  climático,  la \ntarificación  del  carbón  y  las  energías  renovables.  En  muchas  ocasiones,  Xstrata  expresó \npreocupaciones válidas acerca del  diseño de  las políticas propuestas en  Australia (CPRS  y \nCEA) y sobre la posibilidad de fugas de carbono e impactos negativos para la competitividad \ncomercial de Australia. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\finexacta  de \n\ninterpretación \n\nLos  comentarios  atribuidos  al  equipo  de  alta  dirección  de  Xstrata  Coal  fueron  sacados  de \ncontexto  y  constituyen  una \nlas  opiniones  vertidas.  Las \ndeclaraciones  de  Peter  Freyberg  en  el  sentido  de  que  adoptar  medidas  contra  el  carbón \npodría  “costar  puestos  de  trabajo  y  ahuyentar  las  inversiones  hacia  afuera  de  Australia” \nfueron  hechas  para  apoyar  su  reflexión  sobre  los  posibles  impactos  negativos  que  podría \nacarrear una política mal diseñada o diseñada defectuosamente para el cambio climático. El \nSr.  Coates  fue  uno  de  los  muchos  altos  empresarios  y  actores  interesados  a  quienes  se \nsolicitó entregar retroalimentación al gobierno australiano sobre asuntos de cambio climático. \nEs  absolutamente  incorrecto  lo  señalado  en  el  informe  de  que  el  Sr.  Coates  habría \n“advertido” al gobierno que se mantuviera lejos del liderazgo climático. \n\nGlencore  es  miembro  de  una  serie  de  asociaciones  de  la  industria,  que  se  encuentran \nmencionadas  en  su  sitio  web.  Estas  organizaciones  promueven  la  visión  de  la  industria \nofreciendo  a  los  encargados  de  tomar  decisiones  la  oportunidad  de  escuchar  todas  las \naristas  de  la  historia.  A  lo  largo  de  los  años,  tanto  Glencore  como  Xstrata  han  estado \npresentes  en  varias  de  las  Conversaciones  sobre  el  Clima  sostenidas  por  la  Convención \nMarco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC) en calidad de legítimo \nparticipante  y  observador  de  las  discusiones  de  la  CMNUCC.  Estas  conversaciones  se \ndesarrollan  en  un  foro  público,  son  abiertas  a  todos  los  delegados  acreditados,  ya  sean \nempresas o miembros de una asociación reconocida de la industria, y se informa libremente \nacerca de ellas en los medios. \n\nLa captura  y el almacenamiento del carbono (CCS,  por sus siglas en  inglés) es reconocida \npor  la  Agencia  Internacional  de  la  Energía  (AIE)  como  una  tecnología  importante  de  baja \nemisión,  que  se  requerirá  para  reducir  significativamente  las  emisiones  de  gases  de  efecto \ninvernadero  a  nivel  mundial.  Es  absolutamente  apropiado  que  Glencore  apoye  el  futuro \ndesarrollo y utilización de la tecnología CCS. \n\nDeploramos las afirmaciones incorrectas que se efectúan en el informe en las que se implica \nque Glencore “está activa y agresivamente promoviendo sus falsas soluciones a la crisis \nclimática a través de su gran cantidad de grupos de cabildeo ocultos en las sombras”. Hemos \nsido y continuamos siendo un participante constructivo e informado en materia de política de \ncambio climático. Tenemos un interés legítimo en lo relativo al desarrollo de políticas sobre \ncambio climático y en el posible impacto que estas puedan tener sobre nuestra empresa, por \nejemplo, desde la perspectiva del cumplimiento. Nuestra participación y presencia en estas \ndiscusiones es transparente, así como lo son todas las observaciones que hemos efectuado \nsobre estas materias o los comentarios que hemos incluido en nuestros informes públicos."}

A  Vale  em  Moçambique, \npor  sua  escala  e  por  haver  se  concretizado  como  um  projeto  importante  para  a  economia  do \npaís, assume também o compromisso de contribuir para o desenvolvimento das comunidades \nlocais e para a melhoria de seus indicadores sociais. \n\nPara a implantação da Mina Carvão Moatize, cuja operação teve início em 2011, foi necessário \nrealizar  um  programa  detalhado  de  reassentamento  das  famílias  que  viviam  nas  áreas \nindustriais e de lavra. O projeto de reassentamento foi baseado em procedimentos e diretrizes \ninternas da empresa que visam a o respeito e observância aos direitos humanos, tais como a \nNorma  de  Remoção  Involuntária,  o  Manual  de  Relação  com  Comunidades  para  Projetos  de \nCapital,  o  Guia  de  Relacionamento  com  Comunidades  e  o  Procedimento  de  Remoção \nInvoluntária, documentos elaborados à luz das diretrizes internacionais, especialmente aquelas \ndefinidas pelo Banco Mundial e IFC – International Finance Corporation. \n\nEste  programa  começou  em  2006  e  contou  com  o  diálogo  social  com  o  governo  e \ncomunidades. A etapa de transferência das famílias foi concluída em 2010, com a realocação \nde  1.365  famílias  em  dois  reassentamentos,  Cateme,  com  características  rurais,  e  25  de \nsetembro, com características urbanas. A Vale está empenhada no desenvolvimento de ações \nde  apoio  a  essas  famílias,  em  conjunto  com  as  esferas  governamentais,  para  atender  às \nnecessidades das comunidades reassentadas. \n\nAs famílias reassentadas em Cateme receberam 0,8 hectare de terreno onde está implantada a \nsua residência. Para além deste, cada família recebeu 1 hectare de terra  totalmente destinada \nà produção agrícola, além de verba destinada a  potencializar a capacidade produtiva dessas \nfamílias, conforme demanda das próprias famílias e do Governo.  \n\nQuanto  à  assistência  alimentar  regular,  as  famílias  que  optaram  pelo  reassentamento  rural \nreceberam  pacotes  de  alimentos  referentes  à  quebra  no  ciclo  produtivo  de  suas  machambas. \nForam  distribuídos  três  pacotes  de  alimentos,  levando  em  consideração  a  produção  máxima \nque a área de machamba de cada família poderia alcançar. Desde que as famílias passaram a \ncultivar  nas  novas  machambas,  foram  introduzidas  técnicas  para  aumentar  a  produtividade, \ncomo  sementes  melhoradas,  fomento  da  tração  animal,  uso  de  inseticidas  naturais,  fomento \npecuário  de  gado,  melhoramento  genético  de  gado  e  fomento  da  produção  de  frangos.  Além \ndisso,  houve  a  distribuição  de  sete  mudas  de  fruteiras  para  cada  família,  um  total  de  14  mil \nunidades  e,  também,  apoio  técnico  permanente  de  uma  equipe  de  34  profissionais  para \norientar a atividade agrícola. \n\nPara  o  reforço  da  capacidade  agrícola,  a  Vale  disponibiliza  técnicos  e  trabalha  com \nextensionistas  agrários  do  Governo  na  assistência  às  famílias  em  técnicas  de  aumento  da \nprodutividade da terra. Entre outros projectos agrícolas, a Vale apoia: \n\nCampanha agrícola – disponibilizando sementes melhoradas que são canalizada aos Serviços \nDistritais  de  Actividades  Económicas  (SDAE)  que,  por  sua  vez,  disponibiliza  à  comunidade  a \num preço subsidiado através de agrodeallers. \n\nFomento de culturas de rendimento – Disponibilizando mais de 100 hectares em regime de \nsequeiro para fomento das culturas de rendimento, com 87,5 hectares de terras aráveis.  \n\nA  segurança  alimentar  tem  sido  também  objeto  de  capacitações  em  avicultura,  horticultura, \nfinanças  rurais  (inicluindo  liderança  e  associativismo),  culturas  de  rendimento,  pomares \nresidenciais  e  tracção  animal.  No  total,  até  agora,  foram  treinados  1.  364  moradores  do \nreassentamento, sendo que destes, 58% são mulheres.  \n\n1\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \n \n \n\fA  fim  de  fomentar  outras  possibilidades  de  profissionalização  e  geração  de  renda  para  esta \npopulação, a Vale vem oferecendo treinamentos em outras modalidades como capacitação de \nalfabetizadores;  capacitação  de  professores  e  alunos  em  carpintaria,  eletricidade  e  contrução \ncivil  básica;  pedreiro;  restaurante  e  bar;  corte  e  costura;  gestão  de  negócios;  corte  e  costura; \nempreendedorismo  feminino;  poupança  e  empréstimo;  associativismo,  etc.  Mais  de  2.255 \npessoas participaram do conjunto de treinamentos oferecidos pela Vale até agora.  \n\nEm relação às questões envolvendo água e irrigação dos reassentamentos, a Vale concluiu a \nreabilitação  do  sistema  de  abastecimento  de  água  existente  em  Cateme,  revendo  os \nequipamentos  e  condicionando-os  para  um  pleno  funcionamento.  Esta  iniciativa  incluiu \natividades  como  substituição  de  dois  depósitos  elevados  de  10  mil  litros;  colocação  de  três \nbóias  elétricas  nas  torres  elevadas;  substituição  de  bombas  pressurizadoras  e  fontanários; \nsubstituição  de  duas  eletrobombas  submersíveis  nos  poços;  e  implantação  do  projeto  de \nirrigação  gota  a  gota,  envolvendo  100  famílias  para  a  produção  de  horticulas,  iniciado  em  \njunho de 2013. \n\nA Vale também construiu um sistema de abastecimento e distribuição de água constituído por 4 \npoços  de  captação,  2  caixas  d´água  com  capacidade  de  40  m³  e  uma  cisterna  elevada  com \numa capacidade total de 500 m3. Estas fontes de água estão ligadas à rede de 34 fontanários, \natravés  de  11  km  de  tubulação  instalada  para  adução  e  distribuição  que  garante  maior \nautonomia, mesmo face à falta de energia elétrica. A Vale também financiou a construção de \nduas  represas  no  rio  Muaradzi,  que  atravessa  a  zona  de  Cateme.  Com  estas  represas,  os \nagricultores da comunidade reforçaram seu envolvimento em atividades agrícolas. Por forma a \nfacilitar  a  colecta  e  transporte  de  água,  a  Vale  distribuiu  em  Cateme  287  water  rollers  para  a \ncomunidade.  \n\nCom  respeito  a  melhorias  na  infraestrutura  local,  houve  a  reestruturação  e  manutenção  de \nestradas, drenagens e serviços de transporte e sociais. Além de construção de estrada de 8 km \ne  duas  pontes,  a  Vale  subsidiou  o  transporte  por  autocarros,  financiou  uma  escola  primária \nnova, uma escola secundária residencial, um centro de saúde e ambulância, além de local para \na  realização  de  mercado.  Foram  construídas  ainda  uma  casa  mãe  espera,  a  fim  de  impactar \npositivamente  sobre  a  saúde  materno-infantil,  uma  farmácia  pública.  Quanto  ao  investimento \nno acesso à eletricidade, a Vale reforçou e melhorou a  cablagem que transporta energia entre \nTete/Moatize/Cateme;  aumentou  a  rede  de  distribuição  por  todas  as  ruas  da  comunidade  de \nCateme,  incluindo  a  facilitação  da  ligação  entre  as  residências;  deu  provimento  à  iluminação \npública e estabeleceu uma estrutura de gestão da EDM na comunidade de Cateme. \n\n2"}

Vale in Mozambique, due to its scale \nand  its  implementation  of  an  important  project  for  the  country's  economy,  has  also  made  a \ncommitment to contribute to the development of local communities, as such, to the increase of \nopportunities and overall well-being of its members. \n\nAs  an  integral  part  of  the  implementation  of  the  Moatize  Coal  Mine,  which  began  operating  in \n2011, it was necessary to undertake a detailed resettlement program for the families living in the \nindustrial  and  mining  sites.  The  resettlement  process  was  based  on  Vale´s  internal  guidelines \nmeant  to  reinforce  the  observance  of  human  rights,  such  as  the  Resettlement  Norm  and \nProcedures and the Community Relations Guidelines. These documents are largely inspired by \ninternational  directives  such  as  those  defined  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation – IFC.  \n\nThis  program  started  in  2006  and  has  involved  social  dialogue  with  the  government  and \ncommunities.  The  family  transfer  stage  was  completed  in  2010,  following  the  resettlement  of \n1,365  families  to  two  areas:  the  rural  community  of  Cateme,  and  the  urban  district  of  25  de \nSetembro. Vale is dedicated to developing supporting these families, alongside the government, \nin order to meet the needs of the resettled communities. \n\nThe families resettled in Cateme receive a house in 0,8 hectare of land and 1 hectare foreseen \nto  agricultural  production.  Also,  they  have  received  cash  support  in  order  to  potentialize  the \nproduction of these families, as per demand of the families themselves and the governement.  \n\nRegarding  regular  food  assistance,  the  families  that  opted  for  rural  resettlement  received  food \npackages related to the loss of the production cycle on their plots of land. Three food packages \nwere  distributed,  taking  into  account  the  maximum  output  that  each  family's  plot  of  land  could \nhave produced. As the families have begun to cultivate their new plots of land, techniques have \nbeen  introduced  to  enhance  yields,  such  as  the  use  of  improved  seeds,  poultry  production, \nanimal traction, cattle herding and genetic improvement and the use of natural insecticides. In \naddition, seven fruit trees were distributed to each family, in a total of 14 units and permanent \ntechnical support of 34 professionals has been offered to guide the agriculture activities. These \ntechnicians work alongside government professionals in order to share techniques that enhance \nthe lands´ capacity and productivity: \n\n- Agricultural Campaign – Vale provides improved seeds that are channeled through the \nServiços Distritais de Atividades Econômicaas (SDAE). The prices of the seeds are subsidized \nto the communities via agro dealers. \n\n-  Support  to  subsistence  and  commercialization  agriculture  –  Vale  has  put  more  than \n\n100 hectares to the disposal of the community, among which 87,5 are arable.  \n\nFood  security  has  also  been  the  object  of  training  in  poultry,  horticulture,  rural  finances \n(including leadership and association), residential cultivation and animal traction. So far, 1.364 \nresettled individuals have been trained so far, 58% of which are women. \n\nIn  order  to  foment  other  possibilities  of  professionalization  and  income  generation  for  this \npopulation,  Vale  has  been  offering  training  in  other  modalities  such  as:  literacy  education, \ncarpentry for teachers and students, electricity and basic civil construction, masonry, business \nmanagement,  sewing,  women´s  entrepreneurship,  savings  and  landing,  etc.  More  than  2.255 \nresettled people have taken part on the trainings offered by Vale so far. \n\nIn relation to issues involving water and irrigation in the resettled communities, Vale has finished \nrehabilitating  the  existing  water  supply  systems  in  Cateme,  reviewing  equipment  and \nconditioning  it  in  order  to  work  fully.  This  initiative  included  activities  such  as  replacing  two \n10,000-litre raised tanks, installing three electric floats in elevated towers, replacing pressurized \n\n1\t\r  \n\n\t\r  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fpumps  and  fountains,  replacing  two  submersible  electric  pumps  in  wells,  and  implementing  a \ndrip irrigation project involving 100 families to help them grow vegetables, initiated in June 2013. \n\nVale  has  also  built  a  water  supply  and  distribution  system  constituted  of  4  caption  wells,  2 \nreservoirs  with  the  capacity  of  40  m³  and  an  elevated  cistern  with  total  capacity  of  500  m3. \nThese  water  sources  are  linked  to  the  existing  network  of  34  fountains,  along  11  km  of  pipes \noffering  more  autonomy,  even  when  faced  with  electricity  cuts.  Vale  has  also  financed  the \nconstruction of two dams on the Muaradzi River, which courses through the Cateme area. With \nthese dams, local producers reinforce their involvement in agricultural activities. In order to turn \nthe  water  transportation  easier,  Vale  has  distributed  287  water  rollers  for  the  Cateme \ncommunity.  \n\nWith  regards  to  the  improvements  in  local  infrastructures,  roads,  drainage,  transportation  and \nother social services were restructures and maintained. Besides the construction of a 8 km road \nand two bridges, Vale has financed bus transportation for the community, a new primary school, \na boarding secondary school, a health center, an ambulance, and a place for the Market. A new \npublic  pharmacy  and  a  Casa  Mãe  Espera  (care  for  pregnant  women)  were  built  in  order  to \nreinforce  maternal  and  child  health.  Vale  has  also  invested  in  access  to  electricity,  reinforcing \nthe  transmission  lines  between  Tete,  Moatize  and  Cateme  and  has  increased  the  distribution \nnet in all streets of the Cateme community, including residencies and public electricity. Also, it \nintroduced a management system in EDM (public power) in Cateme´s community.  \n\n2"}

In this sense we would like to invite to read the report’s conclusions in the page \n55 of the report: \n (http://www.somo.nl/publications-en/Publication_4188/at_download/fullfile).  \n\nThese conclusions clearly reflect the efforts developed by Inditex regarding not only \nthe  improvement  of  the  working  conditions  in  our  supply  chain,  but  also  a  more \ngeneral  intervention  in  structural  problems  of  the  Brazilian  textile  sector  and,  in  a \nbroader sense, the social and labour integration of migrants in Brazilian society. All \nthese  initiatives  have  been  carried  out  in  close  collaboration  both  with  Brazilian \nNGOs and the Brazilian authorities and they shape the most innovative approach to \nthis issue in the Brazilian industry. \n\nDespite this global positive assessment, SOMO/Repórter Brasil focuses on two main \nconcerns:  a)  the  level  of effectiveness  of  the  compliance  programme  of  Inditex  in \nBrazil  and  b)  the  –according  to  the  editors  of  the  report-  apparent  contradiction \nbetween the CSR policy and the legal approach of the company. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fa)    In the specific field of compliance monitoring in the supply chain, although the \nreport  states  that  “provides  indications  that  the  company’s  supply  chain \nmonitoring  is  not  100%  effective”,  Inditex  can  guarantee  that,  after  the  case \ninvolving  the  Brazilian  company  Ahá  in  summer  2011,  there  has  been  not  a \nsingle  case  of  attempts  against  fundamental  labor  rights  among  the  Brazilian \ncompanies that manufacture its products.   \n\nThe  complete  list  of  Brazilean  companies  supervised  by  Inditex  since  2012 \naccount  for  450  companies,  with  more  than  2,800  audits  completed.  These \nprocedures involve inspections from both independent and international agencies \nas Intertek, SGS and Apcer, and internal surprise visits from in-house teams. Any \ninfringement detected is immediately solved, as the own audits show. \n\nThe  reports  that  you  mention  refer  to  supposed  labour  infringements  in  the \nBrazilean supply chain of Inditex in the past, during 2012, 2013 and 2014. As the \nreport  itself  recognize  (page  49),  most  of  the  initially  mentioned  cases  simply \nwere not related with companies working with Inditex (actually, 65% of the cases \nwere discarded by this reason). Secondly, almost all the cases really related with \nInditex  (85%)  refer  to  usual  discrepancies  between  employees  and  employers \nsolved through conciliation agreements driven under the Inditex’ effort of supply \nchain  monitoring.  The  remaining  cases  (10  during  more  than  two  years  and  a \nhalf) were sanctioned by Labour Courts in regular labour procedures. \n\nNone of the cases mentioned in the report relates to the violation of human rights \nor the systematic breach of basic labour rights, but rather discrepancies between \nemployees  and  employers  in  terms  of  their  respective  assessments  of  specific \naspects of their employment contracts. As is usual in a democratic country with a \nsystem of laws, procedures, and courts, workers are entitled to avail of their right \nto seek protection in a labour court to resolve those discrepancies. The exercise \nof  these  rights  cannot  and  should  not  be  interpreted  as  a  symptom  of  rights \nviolation  but  rather  as  a  sign  that  the  legal  protection  system  afforded  by  a \n\n \n \n \n \n\fdemocratic nation is working as intended. On the contrary, it represents the due \nexercise of his or her rights. \n\nIt  is  true  that  labour  litigation  is  far  more  prevalent  in  Brazil  than  in  other \ndeveloped  economies.  But  compared  to  average  incidence  rates  in  the  overall \nBrazilian  labour  market,  the  number  of  cases  brought  before  the  labour  courts \ninvolving  Inditex’s  supply  chain  point  to  significantly  lower  conflict  rates  - \nspecifically  an  approximate  annual  ratio  of  one  case  for  every  400  workers \ninvolved in Inditex’s supply chain, compared to an average in Brazil of one case \nfor every 25 workers. \n\nThe  report  also  refers  to  the  contents  of  a  hearing  at  the  Labour  Prosecutor’s \nOffice  in  July  2013  to  conclude  that  Inditex  itself  would  recognize  difficulties  to \neffectively  monitor  the  supply  chain.  This  is  just  a  translation  mistake  from  the \nPortuguese original document (attached), where the MPT prosecutors transcript \nInditex  statement  as  follows:  “Inditex  Group  considers  highly  unlikely  [that  a \nsupplier could divert orders to unauthorised workshops], since it would mean the \ncontract  termination  and  that  the  supplier  would  never  work  again  with  the \ngroup”.  Inditex  guarantees  the  correct  performance  and  control  of  the  Brazilian \nsupply chain, backed by the experience of the Framework Agreement signed with \nthe  Federation  of  Unions  and  the  know-how  of  the  audits  performed  by \nindependent companies. \n\nb)    The second concern of the report stands on legal strategy followed by Inditex. \nAs  you  know,  Inditex  has  challenged  the  administrative  procedure  of  the  so \ncalled “Dirty List”, alleging that there is not room for the constitutional right of self-\ndefense. The List is a public exposure of the Companies that have been accused \nof not respecting dignity and labour workers’ right in the supply chain. \n\nFrom  our  point  of  view,  SOMO/Repórter  Brasil  position  contradictorily  argues \nagainst  the  exercise  of  the  constitutional  right  of  any  natural  or  legal  person  to \nappeal a decision before the court authorities but denies it for Inditex.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fWe would like to remark that Inditex’s stance on the “dirty list” is clear-cut: Inditex \nconsiders the list itself totally constitutional. However, Inditex will always defend \nits  democratic  right  to  legitimately  uphold  its  rights  as  an  individual  or  as  a \ncompany,  and  we  have  not  been  given  the  right  to  a  legitimate  defence  in  this \nprocess. The possibility that Zara Brazil could be included on this list would be \nthat  has \nhighly  contradictory  as \ndemonstrated,   an  unprecedented  commitment  to  the  same  objectives  which \nthe “dirty list” sets out to achieve. Inditex would like to be heard, which the current \nprocedure does not allow. \n\nthreatens  punishing  a  company \n\nit \n\nInditex  has  not  only  been  able  to  guarantee  that  there  is  no  precarious \nemployment  among  its  Brazilian  suppliers  since  2011;  the  brand  has  also \ndeveloped  a  more  ambitious  and  innovative  plan  in  Brazil  over  the  last  three \nyears,  with  a  view  to  training  Brazilian  business  owners,  combating  informal \nlabour  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  supporting  the  integration  of  immigrant \ncommunities. Inditex has collaborated closely with renowned NGOs on this task, \nincluding CDHIC, CAMI and Missão Paz. The brand has also worked with public \nbodies  such  as  the  São  Paulo  State  Secretary  of  Justice  and  Defence  of \nCitizenship.  In  the  latter  case,  Inditex  has  contributed  the  funding  required  to \ncreate São Paulo’s Centre for the Integration of Immigrant Citizens. \n\nInditex is implementing one of the most innovative projects in its sector in Brazil \nin order to ensure the traceability of products. Zara is the only retail enterprise in \nBrazil that includes, in all the products manufactured within the country, a label \nspecifying  the  manufacturing  company  and  exact  location  where  the  garments \nwere made, as well as the date when the supplier last underwent an audit. The \nproject, which is called “Fabricado no Brasil” (“Made in Brazil”) is pioneering on a \nglobal level. \n\nfinal  comments  on \n\nthe  report,  we  would \n\nAs \nlist \nof   recommendations  for  clothing  brands  and  retailers  made  by  SOMO/Repórter \nBrasil  (chapter  7.5,  pages  62  and  63)  could  be  perfectly  consider  as  a  reflect  of \nInditex performance in Brazil: \n\nto  remark \n\nthat \n\nlike \n\nthe \n\n  \n \n \n\f-        Consistency  between  legal  and  CSR  strategy:  Inditex  legal  actions  are \nclearly focused on eliminate any sign of arbitrariness and avoid contradictions \nbetween social goals and administrative and legal procedures. Let us to also \nclarify  that  the  “dirty  list”  is  now  suspended  by  a  decision  of  the  Brazilian \nSupreme Court after the request of entities totally alien to Inditex. \n\n-        Supply  chain  mapping  /  Transparency:  Inditex  is  leading  both  the  product \ntraceability  and  the  transparency  of  its  supply  chain,  as  perfectly  shows  not \nonly the development of the accord with the Brazilean labour authorities but \nalso the pioneering project ‘Fabricado no Brasil’. \n\n-        Genuine  and  credible  grievance  mechanism:  The  report  itself,  although  it \ndoes  not  refer  to  the  grievance  mechanism  include  in  the  Inditex  Code  of \nConduct  for  Manufacturers  and  Suppliers,  expressly  mention  (page  43)  the \ndevelopment  of  the  ‘ad  hoc’  mechanism  established  by  Inditex  with  the \nBrazilean NGO CDHIC. \n\n2.- Comments on the articles: \n-  “Fashion  brand  Zara once  again  associated  with  Brazilian  labour  rights  abuses”,  SOMO \nand  Repórter  Brasil,   9  May  2015,  http://www.somo.nl/news-en/fashion-brand-zara-\nassociated-once-again-in-brazilian-labour-rights-abuses \n- [Português] “Zara corta oficinas de imigrantes e será multada por discriminação”, Repórter \nBrasil,  9  May  2015,  http://reporterbrasil.org.br/2015/05/zara-corta-oficinas-de-imigrantes-e-\nsera-multada-por-discriminacao/ \n\nAllegations  contained  in  these  articles  release  in  coordination  by  SOMO  and \nRepórter  Brasil  were  directly  responded  by  Inditex  to  the  authors,  as  could  easily \nchecked  visiting  http://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Respostas-\nZara.pdf. A summary of the Inditex´arguments is as follows: \n\nLabour infractions in the supply chain \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWith  regard  to  the  recent  Brazilian  Labour  Inspection´s  report  claiming  about \nsupossed labour infractions among companies supplying Inditex in Brazil, we must \nfirmly state that: \n\ni)  All  the  cases,  which  are  minor  infringements  that  could  be  easily  solved \nwhen  reported,  are  referred  to  previous  years,  mostly  2012  and  2013,  and \ncannot be defined as 'new'. \nii)  In  any  case,  it  is  not  understandable  why  they  have  not  been  reported \npreviously during all these years. \niii) Following the Law and the Inditex’s Agreement, the Labour inspection had \nthe obligation of reporting any finding to Inditex, which would have then days \nto solve the case. \niv)  Inditex’s  production  represents  only  the  15%  of  the  whole  manufacturing \ncapacity  of  the  Brazilian  companies  mentioned  in  the  Labour  Inspection \nreport, the rest being dedicated to other Brazilian brands. \nv)  The  filing  presents  many  other  inaccuracies  and  unfairly  targets  Inditex \n(please see below analysis about the ‘findings’). \nvi) For all these reasons it has been challenged by Inditex. \n\nWe truly believe that one claim like that cannot be sustained. \n\nAs a matter of fact, as we have previously mentioned, since 2012 Inditex has carried \nout more than 2,800 audits to the Brazilian companies that manufacture its products, \nsupported by the most demanding international procedures based on our Framework \nAgreement with the Global Federation of Unions (IndustriALL, which represents 50 \nmillion  workers  in  144  Countries)  and  performed  by  prestigious  international  and \nindependent agencies as Intertek, SGS and Apcer. Inditex can firmly guarantee the \ncorrect performance of this Brazilian supply chain in terms of labour standards. \n\nAs it has been mentioned beforehand, Inditex’s production represents only the 15% \nof the whole manufacturing capacity of this supply chain, the rest being dedicated to \nother Brazilian brands. It is surprising both that no other brand has been appointed in \nthis  sense  and  the  fact  that  in  all  this  period  since  2012  there  has  not  been  any \n\n \n \n \n \n\freport  from  the  authorities.  Should  they  be  right  now  –even  all  being  minor \nadministrative  cases-,  it  is  not  understandable  why  did  they  not  communicate  any \nissue on time. Mainly because Inditex’s 2011 Agreement with the Labour Inspection \nin Brazil obliges them to do so: to communicate it, should they find any issue, and \nafterwards Inditex had 10 days to solve the case. \n\nIn  the  meantime,  every  Inditex  audit  had  previously  detected  and,  what  is  more \nimportant, solved these cases through the Inditex Compliance Programme. \n\nAnalysis about the ‘findings’: \n\n- All of these cases are administrative infringements. There is not a single case of \nviolation of fundamental rights. \n-  All  of  the  cases  presented  concern  administrative  matters  that  can  be  easily \ncorrected when the irregularity is discovered. \n- During the whole period covered (from 2012 to 2015), audits performed by Inditex \nhave been implemented with its own correction plans, solving in many cases similar \nproblems to the ones included in the Labour Inspection file. \n\na)    Employees working without a formal contract in eight different companies \n\n·          After  checking  the  information  sent  by  the  MTE,  we  can  only  see  17 \nworkers  not  registered.  The  information  sent  by  the  SRTE/SP  does  not \nclarify as the list of all the companies with not registered workers does not \nfit  with  actual  non-compliance  of  in  the  single  files  of  each  of  these \ncompanies. \n\n·          Apparently,  some  or  many  of  these  workers  could  be  in  the  five \n\ncompanies that were not part of the supply chain \n\n·          Also,  our  the  audits  show  that  it  is  not  eight  but  six  companies  who \nwere actually part of the supply chain. Two of them, even being listed in \nthe  TAC  suppliers’  list,  they  were  blocked  for  different  reasons  prior  to \nmanufacture any garment. \n\n·         All these six companies were audited between July 2012 and July 2014 \n\n \n \n \n \n\f·         The audits show that there was also one not registered worker issue in \n\n2013 that was of course solved. \n\n·         None of these eight Companies work anymore in the scope of Inditex. \n\nThey have left to be suppliers between December 12 and July 14. \n\nb)    Companies with excess of working hours \n\n·         We could only confirm 16 of the Companies with these issues from the \n\ninformation sent by the MTE. \n\n·         One of them is blocked and never manufactured in the supply chain. \n·         Of the other 15, one does not work anymore in the supply chain. \n·         The audits for the other 14, suggested to two of them correction plans \nto eliminate any excess of working hours, which has been implemented. \n\n·         No other issues remain in this sense \n\nc)     Companies with FGTS debits \n\n·         In this case we could confirm all the 23 companies listed by the Labour \n\nAuthority. \n\n·         Six of them were blocked and never manufactured in the supply chain. \n·         The other 17 have been audited between July 2012 and April 2015. \n·         These audits also have found and corrected five FGTS debts. \n·          Six  of  these  companies  with  no  major  current  issues  remain  in  the \n\nsupply chain. \n\nd)    Companies with Health and Safety deficiencies \n\n·          We  can  confirm  that  the  audits  of  all  these  companies  have  been \nperformed  correctly  and  on  time  and  that  the  audits  show  a  permanent \ntask for improving health and safety standards. \n\nZara  currently  only  works  with  34  of  the  62  Brazilian  companies  the  SRTE/SP's \norders concern. Zara can confirm that there are no relevant irregularities, as shown \nby  the  audit  reports  produced  by  international  firms  that  specialise  in  such \ninspections: SGS, Intertek and Apcer. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fBaseless discrimination charge \n\nZara does not have any capacity to intervene in the recruitment of employees by the \ncompanies  with  which  it  maintains  commercial  relationships,  for  whom  Zara  is  just \none more client among many other, given that \nproduction  by  Zara  in  these  factories  implies  less  than  15%  of  the  total,  as  it  has \npreviosly  been  mentioned.  To  accept  this  premise  would  be  to  accept  that  all \nthis  alleged \nBrazilian  business  people \ndiscriminatory practices. \n\nthese  suppliers  apply \n\nthat  contract \n\nTo base this surprising, and completely untrue, accusation on the fact that inspectors \nhave  not  been  able  to  find  workers  of  Bolivian  origin  in  some  of  Zara's  suppliers \nleads to the somewhat absurd conclusion that this same discrimination is produced \nin any of the Brazilian companies that do not have Bolivian employees -or from any \nother nationality, origin or race. \n\nAlso, this allegation of discrimination is not supported by facts. Zara is a multinational \ncompany and naturally employs people from different origins and nationalities.  \n\nIt  is  important  to  remember  that  Zara  has  been  fighting  against  precarious \nemployment for years, with various initiatives and specific investment in Brazil. Since \n2011 the company has invested R$14 million in various programs, fundamentally for \nimmigrant support. \n\nThis social investment is focused on two aspects: \n-  Training  and  support  for  micro-companies  and  immigrant  employees  to  assist \nelimination of irregular practices in the textile sector of this country. \n-  Emergency  assistance  and  support  for  social  and  labour  integration  of  the \nimmigrants. \n\nThis task is carried out in collaboration with notable NGO's (such as CDHIC, CAMI or \nMissão  Paz)  and  also  includes  actions  such  as  the  funding  necessary  for  the \ncreation  of  the  Centre  for  Integration  of  Immigrants  to  Citizenship,  in  collaboration \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fwith the Secretary of Citizenship and Justice of the State of São Paulo. The Centre \nintends \nimmigrants  per  day,  assisting  with  migratory \nto  1000 \nstandardisation and promoting professional education. \n\nto  attend \n\nlíder  contra \n\n[Español]  “El \n\n3.- Comments on the following article: \n- \nmultinacionales”, El Diario, 28 April 2015, \n http://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/sociedad/esclavitud-infantil-trabajo-Asia-\nninos_0_382161784.html \n\nla  esclavitud \n\nincomoda  a \n\ninfantil  que \n\nlas  grandes \n\nThe statements made to a Spanish newspaper by Mr. Ehsan Ullah Khan are untrue, \nlack any foundation and they can only be the result of an unjustified obsession with \nslander purpose.

There  is  no \nquestioning  that  mining  activities  in  Brazil  have  had  a  positive  impact  at  the  national  and  local \nlevels.

Since  2012 a  public civil lawsuit \nhas  been  underway  that  contests  the  legality  of  the  licensing  process  for  the  work  to  expand  the \nCarajás  Railroad  (EFC).  The  public  civil  lawsuit  also  questions  the  fact  that  the  construction  work \nhas been analyzed and licensed in a fragmented manner and through a simplified, fast procedure, \nmaking  it  impossible  to  analyze  synergistic,  cumulative  and  indirect  impacts.  Vale  proposed,  and \nthe  Brazilian  environmental  regulator  (Ibama)  approved,  simplifying  the  licensing  process,  thereby \nexempting the company from the need for an environmental impact assessment (EIA-RIMA), public \nhearings  and  a  consultation  regarding  inquiries  about  the  prior,  free  and  informed  consent  of \nimpacted traditional communities.

The  entities  that  filed \nthe public civil lawsuit appealed this decision and the appeal should be heard soon by the Superior \nCourt of Justice, which may order the construction work to be halted once more.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nVale clarifies that the environmental licensing of the Carajás Railroad (EFC)’s  expansion was based \non the legal standards of the federal, state and municipal spheres. All the social and environmental \nstudies, plans and programs developed to mitigate the impacts caused by the work were properly \nsubmitted  and  compiled  in  the  Basic  Environmental  Plan  (PBA).  With  regard  to  indigenous  and \nquilombola \nspecific \nrecommendations  have  been  developed  for  each  affected  community.  All  these  steps  had  the \nparticipation  of \nintense  process  engagement  and \nconsultation,  offering  access  to  information  about  the  enterprise  before  the  implementation  had \nbegun,  discussing  their  worries  and  demands  and  working  on  short  and  long  term  mitigation \nprograms  \n\nindigenous  communities,  reflecting  an \n\nimpact  matrices \n\nanthropological \n\ncommunities, \n\ndiagnoses, \n\nand \n\nVale  acted  in  line  with  legal  provisions,  holding  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special \nconcern  for  technical  studies  regarding  indigenous  peoples  and  quilombola  communities,  and \nextensive  dialogue  with  them.  Communication  with  communities  near  the  railroad  is  permanent. \nPublic meetings were held with the affected communities on July 9, 10, 12 and 13, 2012, in addition \nto  meetings  dedicated  exclusively  to  quilombola  and  indigenous  communities.  These  public \nmeetings and hearings complied with the terms of CONAMA Resolution 09/86, which provides for \nprocedures for public participation within the scope of environmental licensing.  \n\nDue  to  the  regularity  of  the  studies  and  the  entire  public  consultation  process,  Vale  obtained  the \nrespective environmental licenses to install the project, and obtained approval from FUNAI and the \nPalmares Foundation to expand the railroad.  \n\nConcerning  the  Free,  Prior,  and  Informed  Consent  procedure  for  indigenous  and  traditional \npopulations, although Brazil abides by ILO Convention 169, through Legislative  Decree 143/2002, \nthe regulations stipulating procedures and the scope of rules is still under discussions.. Regardless \nof  this,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialogue  established  between  Vale  and  the  traditional \ncommunities  along  the  EFC,  as  well  as  the  provision  of  all  necessary  information  related  to  the \nproject  previous  of  its  implementation  to  these  communities,  in-person,  and  the  consultation  on \nwhich  and  how  the  mitigations  plans  should  be  developed  and  implemented  meet  the  essential \nobjective of ILO Convention 169. \n\nThe regularity of the environmental licensing process was reaffirmed in a court ruling of the Federal \nRegional Court (TRF), which recognized that the measures taken by Vale are in full compliance with \nthe requirements of the competent technical and environmental authorities. Note that the work does \nnot  involve  building  a  new  railroad  or  double-tracking  the  entire  length  of  the  existing  one,  but \nmerely  connecting  existing  railroad  yards  along  the  original  track,  which  will  generate  benefits  for \ngeneral  cargo  and  passenger  transportation,  besides  the  iron  ore.  Accordingly,  Vale  has  been \ninvesting  heavily  in  local  manpower  training  and  social  and  environmental  programs  to  boost  the \nlocal development of the region and its population. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Accordingly, \nperiodic inspections are carried out throughout the railroad to preserve the railroad safety strip.  \n\nWith regard to records of cracks in houses resulting from the impacts of railroad transportation, Vale \nadopts  mechanisms  to  inspect  and  survey  these  houses.  In  the  case  of  railroad  crossings,  Vale \nconducts  periodic  inspections  to  regularize  or  remove  illegal  crossings.  To  regularize  them,  the \ncompany counts the number of vehicles that use them in order to identify the need for signage and \ncrossing adjustments, or to install a road bridge. \n\nOfficial  railroad  crossings  are  those  that  have  been  approved  and  recognized  by  Vale,  and  they \nreceive proper signage and maintenance. The Carajás Railroad has 126 official railroad crossings \nalong its 892-km length, with an average distance between crossings of around 7 km.  \n\nAccording  to  the  National  Association  of  Railroad  Transportation  Companies  (ANTF),  the  EFC  is \nnow  considered   one   of   Brazil’s   leading   railroads,  not  only  due  to  its  freight  volumes,  but  also \nbecause it uses cutting-edge technology in its operations, making it highly productive, efficient and \nsafe.  To  guarantee  maximum  operational  safety  and  high  productivity  for  its  customers,  the  EFC \ncontinuously  invests  in  maintaining  and  expanding  its  assets,  including  by  acquiring  locomotives \nand specialist railcars to transport a variety of goods. \n\nDespite presenting continual improvements in the internationally adopted indicator of accidents per \nmillion  train-km  (mTKm),  which  takes  into  account  accidents  in  line  with  the  number  of  trains  and \ndistance  travelled,  we  know  we  still  need  to  do  more.  We  run  a  series  of  initiatives  to  mitigate \nimpacts and have teams dedicated to managing, monitoring, tracking and responding to incidents. \n\nOur mitigation initiatives include educational and awareness-raising campaigns in communities near \nthe  railroad,  modernization  and  expansion  of  signaling  systems,  the  identification  of  critical \nstretches  in  terms  of  environmental  risks,  weather  monitoring,  and  expansion  of  the  number  of \nsimulators and train operation training courses. We have also developed systems to block failures, \nstandardize operations, and carry out periodic maintenance of track and rolling stock.  \n\nCONCESSION-HOLDERS \n\nAccidents per million train-km – Vale \nAcidentes por Milhão de Trem Km - Vale\n\nCONCESSIONÁRIAS\nFerrovia Vitoria Minas\nVitória-Minas Railroad \nCarajás Railroad \nEstrada de Ferro Carajás\n\n2001\n24,0\n9,0\n\n2002\n25,0\n13,0\n\n2003\n15,0\n6,0\n\n2004\n10,0\n6,0\n\n2005\n10,5\n5,2\n\n2006\n5,8\n7,4\n\n2007\n4,1\n4,4\n\n2008\n2,8\n6,6\n\n2009\n3,8\n5,5\n\n2010\n3,5\n4,8\n\n2011\n2,8\n4,4\n\n2012\n2,7\n4,0\n\n2013\n2,7\n3,5\n\n2014\n2,7\n4,1\n\n25,0\n\n24,0\n\n25,0\n\nFerrovia Vitoria Minas\n\nVitória-Minas \nRailroad \n\nEstrada de Ferro Carajás\n\nCarajás Railroad \n\n20,0\n\n15,0\n\n10,0\n\n9,0\n\n5,0\n\n0,0\n\n15,0\n\n13,0\n\n10,0\n\n10,5\n\n6,0\n\n6,0\n\n5,2\n\n7,4\n\n4,4\n\n5,8\n\n6,6\n\n5,5\n\n4,1\n\n2,8\n\n3,8\n\n4,8\n\n3,5\n\n4,4\n\n2,8\n\n4,0\n\n2,7\n\n3,5\n\n2,7\n\n4,1\n\n2,7\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

There  were  no  significant  lasting \nimpacts to the environment or to local indigenous populations.  \n\nFollowing the spill, demonstrations ensued by some residents of local communities that resulted in \ndamages to Vale property and delays in resuming production.   \n\nThe  CCCE  has  been  mandated  by  customary  chiefs  to  take  a  leadership  role  in  the  mediation \nprocess  with  all  community  stakeholders  involved.  A  mediation  process  was  set  up  through  the \nsubsequent  months  and  more  than  60  meetings  occurred  with  a  variety  of  stakeholder  groups \n(communities’   representatives,   South   Province   authorities,   municipalities,   customary   Senate,  \nunions,  tribal  chiefs,  NGOs,  Government,  among  others).  These  wide  consultations  allowed  the \nlocal population to follow the implementation of corrective and preventive actions defined by experts \nfrom  the  South  Province  and  VNC.  The  result  of  that  process  was  to  restore  and  normalize  the \nrelationship between Vale and local communities.  \n\nSince  the  resumption  of  operations  at  VNC,  the  Community  Relations  team  has  intensified  its \ninteractions with local communities and held several meetings with local tribes to initiate structuring \nprojects  for  communities.  A  Sustainability  Department  has  been  created  to  better  promote  social \nand   environmental   projects.   Moreover,   monthly   reports   about   VNC’s   environmental   performance  \nare shared with the local communities. \n\nVale New Caledonia has implemented a set of action plans to secure the site that cover the areas \nof  safety,  organization,  environment  and  quality.

Material was collected between April 2009 and \nJanuary  2011  at  nine  monitoring  stations  in  Greater  Vitória.  As  a  result,  it  was  seen  that  the \natmospheric  quality  standards  defined  by  the  National  Environment  Council  are  being  complied \nwith, and that the contribution of industries is only predominant at the Senac Hotel station, on Boi \nIsland.  At  the  Enseada  do  Suá  and  Carapina  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  of  the  same \nmagnitude as the contribution  called  “human  activities” (re-suspension of soils and streets, vehicles \nand  burned  objects).  At  the  other  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  not  predominant,  with  a \nshare varying from 10% to 25% of total contributions.  \n\nThe  available  study,  however,  did  not  consider  the  environmental  improvements  implemented  at \nTubarão  Complex  in  recent  years,  as  it  was  completed  before  the  measures  provided  for  in  the \nEnvironmental Commitment Agreement were taken. As a result, for Vale it is essential to carry out \nnew  studies  to  update  and  expand  the  data,  to  determine  the  share  of  different  sources  in  the \ncomposition  of  the  “black  dust”  in  each  region  of  Greater  Vitória and enable strategic management \nof  the  region’s  air  quality.  \n\nThe  company  is  participating  in  new  studies  in  partnership  with  the  State  Public  Prosecution \nMinistry and the State Environment and Water Resources Institute. \n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the company invested R$700 million in environmental controls. As a result \nof  these  investments,  Vale’s  entire  production  system  at  Tubarão Complex, from the arrival of iron \nore  until  its  loading  onto  ships,  is  equipped  with  the  most  modern  environmental  control \ntechnologies.  \n\nThis investment includes the following: the installation of wind fences, pioneering structures in Brazil \nthat reduce the wind speed around piles of iron ore and pellets, cutting the amount of dust carried \ninto the air by 77%; the application of dust polymers and suppressants, products that prevent dust \nemissions  in  piles  of  iron  ore  and  pellets;  the  use  of  new  longer  chutes  on  ship  loaders  to  direct \nproducts  into  vessel  holds;  the  enclosure  of  areas  where  products  are  transferred  from  one \nconveyor belt to another; and the operation of 25 electrostatic precipitators, equipment that is 99% \nefficient in controlling emissions in smokestacks. \n\nTubarão  Complex  also  has  an  Environmental  Control  Center,  which  uses  a  CCTV  system \ncomposed  of  22  continuously  operating  cameras  to  monitor  Vale’s   operations,  in  order  to \npreventively  guarantee  the  effectiveness  of  environmental  controls.  This  enables  immediate \ndecision making, with agility and efficiency, in the event of operational deviations. \n\nVale reiterates its commitment to the environment and the communities of Greater Vitória. \n\nVale  is  fully  willing  to  collaborate  with  the  Parliamentary  Commission  of  Inquiry  about  black  dust \ninstigated by the Legislative Assembly of Espírito Santo in order to investigate particulate emissions \nand their effect on the health of Greater  Vitória’s  people, and it reiterates that it is always open to \ndialogue with society. \n\n8)  Death of two workers in Sudbury, Canada \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The  Centre  began  its \noperations  in  November  2014.  The  company  received   the   top   honours   award   in   the   ‘EIA   Project  \nCategory’   from   the   DOE   in   2012   for   its   compliance   with   environmental   legal   requirements,  \nmonitoring records and impact management initiatives. Vale also received the Social Service Award \nat  Asia-Pacific  Enterprise  Leadership  Awards  (APELA)  2013.  The  Award  is  a  third  party \nendorsement   of   our   company’s   role   as   a   catalyst   of   social   development   and   reinforces   our  \ncommitment in promoting a constructive dialogue with the local communities in the Manjung District. \n\nSince the beginning of its activities in Teluk Rubiah, Vale has been implementing a thorough social \ndialogue, socio-economic diagnosis and community development program involving all community \nstakeholders,  with  special  focus  given  to  the  fishermen  and  business  communities  of  Pulau \nPangkor, Seri Manjung and Teluk Batik.  \n\nOnly  in  the  construction  phase  Vale  invested  around  USD10  million  in  social  and  environmental \nprojects  that  were  developed  and  implemented  in  partnership  with  local  fishermen  community \ngroups,  such  as  the  Fishermen  Associations  of  Pulau  Pangkor  and  Manjung  Selatan,  and \ngovernment  agencies  and  departments  –  Marine  Department  of  Malaysia  (LKIM),  Fishery \nDepartment of Malaysia, Manjung Municipal Council and District Office.  \n\nVale  has  also  undertaken  in  partnership  with  the  Sustainable  Mining  Institute  (CSRM)  from  The \nUniversity  of  Queensland  an  in-depth  socio-economic  diagnosis  of  the  Manjung  District  together \nwith the local communities. As an outcome of this process, Vale is now implementing  a long-term \nCSR  program,  called  the  Community  Development  Plan  (CDP)  in  partnership  with  local  NGOs \n(such  as  Global  Environment  Centre,  Malaysian  Nature  Society,  Outward  Bound  School,  UniKL \nMIMET and UniKL UBis) and fishermen groups.  \n\nIn terms of local job generation, from its 350 direct employees in Teluk Rubiah, more than 90% are \nlocals and 55% of them have joined the company as apprentices who have gone through a 2-year \ntraining  program  organized  by  Vale  in  partnership  with  a  local  university,  UniKL  MIMET  which \nincluded theoretical and on-the-job trainings in Malaysia and Brazil. Around 50 employees are the \nchildren  of  the  local  fishermen  communities  of  Pulau  Pangkor  and  Manjung  and  have  joined  the \ncompany as junior apprentices.   \n\nIn addition, only in the construction phase more than 60% of the total investments were channeled \nto local suppliers, generating a positive socio-economic spillover effect in the region.  \n\nVale has also invested in the preservation of the natural environment in Teluk Rubiah. About 60% \nof the area owned by Vale is maintained by the company as a protected forest area, known as the \nTeluk  Rubiah  forest.  Vale  has  recently  opened  an  Eco  Park  in  partnership  with  the  Malaysian \nNature  Society  inside  the  forest  area  for  community  engagement  and  environmental  education \npurposes.  \n\nIn  addition,  Vale  has  also  proactively  engaged  in  other  environmental  initiatives,  such  as  the \nimplementation   of   the   “Green   Belt”   along   the   shoreline   within   the   site   in   Teluk   Rubiah   and   other  \nenvironmental management activities. They include management of water, air and noise. We also \nhave a regular environment monitoring system which  covers air,  noise,  water and marine ecology \n(Plankton and Coral). \n\nAs of today, Vale has been continuously fulfilling and complying with the DEIA conditions as stated \nand all the mitigation and controls are well in place. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

As casas, construídas pela \nprópria  Vale,  já  passaram  por  reformas  ao  menos  três  vezes  devido  às  rachaduras,  aos \nvazamentos e à erosão que abala a estrutura das casas. Vários protestos já foram realizados pelas \nfamílias  reassentadas,  alguns  com  o  bloqueio  das  estradas  que  dão  acesso  à  mina  da  Vale.  As \nfamílias denunciam as precárias condições de vida a que estão sujeitas desde o final de 2009 e até \no momento  não  houve  nenhuma  resposta  satisfatória  da  empresa.  “Nos  prometeram  dois  hectares  \nde  terra,  só  deram  um,  e  uma  terra  ruim  que  não  rende  nada”,  João  Salicuchepa  Gimo,  que  mora  \ncom a mulher e sete filhos no assentamento de Cateme.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “In  Mozambique,  Vale  is  known  for  the  terrible  conditions  in  which  it  resettled \nmore than 1,300 families, removed from their lands occupied for generations to  make way for the \ncompany’s  coal  mining  project  in  Tete province. The families live with difficult access to water, land \nand  energy,  on  land  unsuited to farming, and they have  not  yet received the full compensation  to \nwhich  they  are  entitled.  The  houses,  built  by  Vale  itself,  have  already  undergone  renovations  at \nleast  three  times  due  to  cracks,  leaks  and  structural  erosion.  The  resettled  families  have  held \nvarious protests, in some cases blocking  the  roads  that  provide  access  to  Vale’s  mine. The families \nhave complained about the poor living conditions to which they have been subjected since the end \nof 2009, and so far there has been no satisfactory response from the company.  ‘They  promised  us  \ntwo hectares of  land  but  they  only  gave  us  one,  and  it’s  poor  land  that  doesn’t  produce  anything,’  \nsaid João Salicuchepa Gimo, who lives with his wife and seven children in the Cateme settlement.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nDespite  presenting  significant  progress,  Mozambique  is  a  country  that  still  poses  challenging \nsocioeconomic  conditions  for  businesses.  Vale  in  Mozambique,  given  its  scale  and  status  as  an \nimportant  project  for   the   country’s  economy,  also  assumes  the  commitment  to  contribute  to  the \ndevelopment of local communities and improvements in their social indicators. \n\nTo implement Moatize Coal Mine, which started up in 2011, it was necessary to carry out a detailed \nresettlement  program  for  the  families  who  lived  in  the  industrial  and  mining  areas.  Following \nprocedures and guidelines established by the company based  on respect for human rights and in \nline with international standards, this program began in 2006 and involved social dialogue with the \ngovernment  and  communities.  The  family  transfer  stage  was  completed  in  2010,  with  the \nresettlement of 1,365 families into two new settlements: Cateme, with rural characteristics; and 25 \nde Setembro, with urban characteristics. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Based  on the findings of this research  and  analysis  of national and international human \nrights  safeguards,  we  identified  practical  recommendations  of  greatest  relevance  to  potential \nresettlement  resulting  from  various  development  projects  that  may  occur  in  Mozambique  in  the \ncoming years. \n\nThe  fact  that  Human  Rights  Watch  based  its  research  on  concrete  data  and  its  problem-solving \nattitude made this engagement process a rich learning experience for Vale and highly beneficial for \nthe resettled families. \n\nIn its report, Human Rights Watch recognized  Vale’s  efforts  to solve the problems presented by the \nresettled people and stressed that Vale and the government of Mozambique signed a memorandum \nof understanding, and almost all of the actions in this agreement have now been implemented.  \n\nVale in Mozambique has been working continuously to improve the new settlements and is striving \nto take measures to support these families, together with the spheres of government and based on \ndialogue with these communities.  \n\nThe process of producing the Resettlement Action Plan involved extensive engagement and public \nparticipation, consisting of three public hearings, 20 theater performances in the predominant local \nlanguage  (Nyungwe),  110  meetings  with  the  community  and  its  leaders  using  tools  such  as \nillustrated materials, 4,927 home visits to families and leaders for mobilization and social assistance \npurposes, and 639 social consultations until the start of resettlement. \n\nAs  part  of  the  process  of  implementing  the  Moatize  Coal  project,  the  following  infrastructure  was \nbuilt  or  renovated  for  the  community  in  the  Cateme  and  25  de  Setembro  areas:  an  elementary \nschool,  library,  teachers’   houses,   school   principal’s  house,  high  school,  information  technology \nroom, laboratory, health and maternity center, police station, streets, and electric power facilities. \n\nIn the neighborhood of Cateme, for example, Vale built two schools within the scope of the national \neducation system. One of them is Cateme Elementary School, which can accommodate up to 1,200 \nstudents,  with  18  classrooms  and  a  library.  Cateme  High  School,  in  turn,  is  designed  for  up  to \naround  650  students  and  has  12  classrooms,  a  library,  accommodation  for  270  students,  and  an \ninformation technology room. \n\nOn July 6, 2012, Vale and the central government signed a memorandum of understanding in order \nto  establish  coordinated  actions  between  the  public  sphere,  the  company  and  community \nrepresentatives  to  maintain  the  existing  infrastructure  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the \ncommunities of Cateme and 25 de Setembro. \n\nThe  following  actions  have  been  carried  out:  maintenance  of  public  drains  and  streets, \nimprovements  to  the  water  supply  system,  expansion  of  the  power  grid,  construction  of  sports \nfacility,  investments  in  agriculture,  development  of  solutions  to  support  public  transport,  and \ninvestments in health, such as the delivery of the 25 de Setembro Health Center and donation of an \nambulance.  \n\nActions  are  being  developed  to  establish  alternative  income  generation  sources,  such  as  the \nfollowing: \n\n  Production  and  sale  of  chickens  to  increase   families’   income.  This  project  has  supported \n197 poultry farmers (109 women and 88 men) who are in full production, making a profit of \nUS$250 to US$350 per batch.  \n\n  Vegetable program,  which  is  designed  to  increase  families’  income  by  growing  and  selling \nvegetables  (tomatoes,  lettuces,  kale,  cabbages,  eggplants,  cucumbers,  peppers  and \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

So far, 61 kits drip-feed  irrigation  systems  have  been  installed  in  the  families’  yards \n(39 belonging to women and 22 to men). \n\n  Cash crop program, benefiting 176 families involved in growing sesame seeds and peanuts. \n\nThese families receive technical assistance from Vale.  \n\n  Home orchard program, aimed  at  increasing  families’  income  by  producing  and  selling  fruit,  \nwhile  encouraging  fruit  consumption  to  improve  the  community’s   diet.  This  program \nbenefited 57 families, by acquiring 2,892 fruit trees (including mango, guava and lemon). \n\n  Development of poultry and horticulture value chain in Cateme, through the installation of a \n\nslaughterhouse and vegetable packing house.  \n\n  Holding  of  vocational  training  courses  on  electricity,  IT  and  construction  for  150  young \n\npeople in Cateme.  \n\nIn  order  to  reinforce  community  dialogue  and  engagement,  and  promote  civic  and  citizenship \nactivities,  Vale  has set up  a number of  community centers. Among  other purposes, these centers \nare  designed  to  share  information,  interests  and  expectations,  build  mutual  trust,  improve \nknowledge of local reality and support the community in finding solutions to demands raised during \nmeetings between the company and residents. The community centers involve the collaboration of \ncommunity  agents,  who  are  members  of  the  community  hired  by  Vale  to  facilitate  community \ndialogue.  \n\nThe actions conducted by Vale in region include the following: \n\n \n\nImplementation of a community radio station: In partnership with the Social Communication \nInstitute,  Vale  has  established  a  community  radio  station  in  Cateme  to  produce  programs \naimed at community development. \n\n  Health: Construction of “Mothers’  Waiting  House,” a building designed to receive pregnant \nwomen  awaiting  birth.  The  Cateme  Health  Center,  which   includes   the   Mothers’   Waiting  \nHouse, serves communities located within a 20-km radius. \n\n  Road  building:  As  a  way  of  supporting  the  communities  and  improving  Cateme’s  \n\naccessibility, Vale built an 8-km paved road, including two bridges. \n\n  Expansion of power grid: In response to community requests, Vale funded the expansion of \n\nthe power grid, to cover all the new neighborhoods of Cateme. \n\n \n\nIncrease  in  water  storage  capacity:  Vale  has  built  two  dams  in  Cateme,  raising  the  water \nstorage  capacity  to  supply  crops  and  livestock.  It  has  also  distributed  drums  to  facilitate \nwater transportation, reducing the amount of time spent on this activity.  \n\n  Promotion  of  livestock  farming:  Vale  donated  150  cattle  to  50  families.  Each  family \nreceived three  animals  (two  oxen  to  be  used  as  draft  animals  and  one  cow  for \nreproduction).  The  company  also  donated  25  Brahman  bulls  to  improve  the  genetics  of \nlocal cattle. \n\n  Training  on  rural  finance:  Around  800  families  have  done  training  on  savings  and  credit, \nleadership,  management  and  business  development,  and  how  to  establish  and  run \nassociations. This training culminated in the formation of eight associations and two unions \nin  the  community  of  Cateme.  The  aim  of  this  training  was  to  ensure  food  security  by \npromoting entrepreneurial  capabilities and skills to create and manage small self-sufficient \nenterprises to generate income. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Na  área  de  carregamento  e  descarregamento,  há  uma  alta  concentração  de  poeira,  que \ncausa a perda da  vegetação na região e coloca em risco a saúde dos habitantes. A partir de um \nestudo  realizado,  o  Instituto  de  Estudos  Sociais  e  Econômicos  Moçambicano  (Iese)  alertou  que \nMoatize  poderá  enfrentar  graves  problemas  de  poluição  atmosférica,  devido  às minas  de  carvão, \nalém  de  constatar  que  a  presença  no  ar  de  poluentes,  como  o  dióxido  de  enxofre,  óxidos  de \nnitrogénio  e  monóxido  de  carbono,  poderá  ser  prejudicial  para  a  saúde  da  população  em  longo \nprazo.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “In  the  district  of  Moatize,  in  Tete  province,  Mozambique,  home  to  one  of  the \nworld’s   largest   coal   deposits,   Vale  S.A.  is  engaged  in  open-pit  coal  mining.  In  the  loading  and \nunloading area, there is a high concentration of dust, causing a loss of vegetation in the region and \nendangering  the  health  of  its  inhabitants.  A  study  carried  out  by  the  Mozambican  Social  and \nEconomic  Study  Institute  (Iese)  warned  that  Moatize  may  suffer  serious  atmospheric  pollution \nproblems due to its coal mines, and found that the presence in the air of pollutants such as sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide  may  be  harmful  to  the  population’s  long-term health.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nWith regard to air quality, we have a real-time monitoring network with stations located inside and \noutside the concession area, measuring emissions levels. To gauge possible emissions arising from \nthe concession area, in April 2015 we set up a station within the community (in the boundary with \nthe concession area). We follow air quality legal standards. We monitor SO2, NO2, O3, PTS, PM10 \nand PM2.5. These parameters record concentrations below the standards at our monitoring station \nlocated  between  the  mining  concession  and  the  community,  indicating  a  low  impact  of  mining \nactivity. On the other hand, the monitoring station located inside the town of Moatize presents high \nlevels of particulate matter, indicating the influence of other activities on these concentrations. The \nconcentrations recorded so far at the station in the boundary of the community and the concession \narea may be associated with the effectiveness of the environmental particulate control measures in \nplace at the mine, namely fixed sprinkler systems in the stockyard, mist cannons at the run of mine \n(ROM)  pad,  sprinkling  of  temporary  access  roads,  and  the  application  of  a  bitumen-based \nbiodegradable   emulsion   called   “Dust-a-Side”   on   permanent   access   roads   to   reduce   particulate  \nmatter emissions. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Negando, deste modo, sua própria negligência e os \nimpactos  da  intensificação  da  extração  mineral  na  saúde  do  trabalhador.  Para  piorar,  a  empresa \ncostuma culpabilizar as vítimas. \n\nNo processo de intensificação da jornada de trabalho, a Vale conseguiu anular a jornada de turno \nrodízio de seis horas. Este turno garante, minimamente, que, diante de um trabalho desgastante, \ndecorrente  do  revezamento  da  jornada  entre  os  períodos  diurno  e  noturno,  além  de  perigoso  e \ninsalubre  como  o  da  mineração,  os  trabalhadores  consigam  algum  tipo  de  bem-estar  e  tenham \ntempo  livre  fora  das  minas.  O  aumento  da  jornada  de  trabalho  para  oito  horas  resulta  em  mais \nacidentes,  mais  afastamentos  por  problemas  de  saúde  e  no  aumento  de  uma  doença  que  vem \nassolando os trabalhadores mineiros: a depressão.” \n\nEnglish version: “In  Canada,  Minas  Gerais  and  Parauapebas,   labor unions  denounce the under-\nreporting of work accidents, increase in length of working days, high amount of overtime demanded, \nincrease in pressure and  harassment within the company, co-opting of unions, and persecution of \nunion leaders. \n\nIts  2013  Sustainability  Report  mentions  some  accidents  that  occurred  within  its  operational  sites. \nHowever,  Vale  does  not  take  responsibility  for  these  accidents,  nor  for  the  seven  deaths  that \noccurred.  In  this  way,  it  denies  its  own  negligence  and  the  impacts  of  intensification  of  mineral \nextraction  on  workers’  health. To make things worse, the company continues to blame victims. \n\nAs part  of the  working  day intensification  process, Vale has managed to end the six-hour rotating \nshift working day. This system ensures that, given the stress involved in taking turns doing day and \nnight  shifts,  as  well  as  the  dangerous  and  unhealthy  nature  of mining  work,  workers  obtain  some \nkind of wellbeing and have free time away from the mines.

O  sindicato \nMetabase Inconfidentes, em Minas Gerais, por exemplo, acusa a Vale de engessar as ações dos \nsindicatos e criar empecilhos às tentativas de garantir melhores condições de vida e trabalho. Um \ndos mais recentes casos foi a perseguição a dirigentes, que culminou com a demissão do diretor \nsindical  Vander  Luis  Ferreira,  em  junho  de  2014,  sem  qualquer  justificativa  razoável.  Na  época, \nestavam  ocorrendo  várias  manifestações  de  trabalhadores  e  da  população  em  geral  que \nreivindicavam  condições  básicas  de  trabalho,  segurança,  saúde  e  transporte  nas  localidades  em \nque a Vale e outras mineradoras atuam. O diretor foi penalizado por ter ousado criticar a empresa \ndiante da imprensa. Este tem sido o padrão histórico de atuação da Vale, tanto no Brasil como no \nexterior. Em 2008, o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Indústrias Petroquímicas (Sindiquímica),  do \nParaná[8],  encaminhou  uma  queixa  sobre  as  práticas  antissindicais  da  Vale  para  a  Organização  \nInternacional do Trabalho (OIT). \n\nNa   operação   em   Voisey’s   Bay,   Labrador,   Canadá,   a   relação   entre   a   Vale   e   o   sindicato   não   foi  \ntotalmente reparado, e o legado da greve de 18 meses (2009-2011) continua.  Há relatos de que, \napós o fim da greve, a Vale continua com as práticas de gestão arbitrária no local de trabalho. A \nVale  continua  a  dificultar  a  vida  dos  trabalhadores  através  da  busca  por  acordos  nos  casos  de \nprocessos  e  arbitragem.  O  estilo  de  gestão  da  empresa  Vale  é  muitas  vezes  interpretado  como \numa  estratégia  para  minar  sutilmente  a  força  dos  sindicatos,  e  isolar  a  liderança  sindical  eleita \ndemocraticamente. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

O  Sindicato  Metabase  Carajás,  no  Pará,  é  o  maior \nsindicato mineiro do país e por se localizar no coração da principal mina da Vale possui um papel \nestratégico  para  a  empresa.  A  prática  de  cooptação  da  Vale  no  sindicato  veio  à  tona  em  2014, \nquando, após 20 anos, um grupo de trabalhadores conseguiu inscrever uma chapa para concorrer \nà  presidência  do  sindicato  sem  ser  derrotada  nos  bastidores.  Durante  essas  duas  décadas,  a \nempresa  e  o  próprio  movimento  sindical  cooptado  alegavam  a  inexistência  de  oposição  entre  os \ntrabalhadores, abafando a permissiva influência da empresa e a insatisfação dos trabalhadores.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “Contrary  to  Vale’s  claims,  workers  and  communities  report  a  non-existence  of \ndialogue,  intimidating  practices  and  a  permanent  policy  of  co-opting  the  labor  movement  and  its \nrepresentatives in order to control criticism. The Metabase Inconfidentes union in Minas Gerais, for \nexample,  accuses  Vale  of  stifling  the  actions  of  unions  and  creating  obstacles  to  attempts  to \nguarantee better living and working conditions. One of the most recent cases was the  persecution \nof leaders, which culminated in the dismissal of union director  Vander Luis Ferreira in June 2014, \nwithout  any  reasonable  grounds.  At  the  time,  various  protests  were  taking  place  among  workers \nand  the  general  public  to  demand  basic  working,  safety,  health  and  transport  conditions  in  the \nlocations  where  Vale  and  other  miners  operate.  The  director  was  penalized  for  having  dared  to \ncriticize the company in the press. This  has  been  Vale’s  standard conduct over time, both in Brazil \nand  abroad.  In  2008,  the  Petrochemical  Industry  Workers  Union  (Sindiquímica)  in  Paraná[8] \nsubmitted   a   complaint   about   Vale’s   anti-union  practices  to  the  International  Labor  Organization \n(ILO). \n\nAt  the  operation  in  Voisey’s Bay, Labrador, Canada, relations between Vale and the union were not \ncompletely repaired, and the legacy of the 18-month strike (2009-2011) remains. There are reports \nthat  following  the  end  of  the  strike,  Vale  continues  to  have  arbitrary  management  practices  in  the \nworkplace. Vale  continues  to  hinder  workers’  lives  by  pursuing  agreements  in  cases of lawsuits and \narbitration. The  company’s  management  style  is  often  interpreted as a strategy to subtly undermine \nunions’  power  and  isolate  democratically  elected union leaders. \n\nDisrespect for free association and co-opting of union. The Carajás Metabase Union in Pará is the \nlargest  mining  union  in  the  country,  and  because  it  is  located  at  the  heart  of  Vale’s  main  mine,  it  has  \na strategic role for the company. Vale’s  practice  of  co-opting the union came to light in 2014, when \nafter  20  years  a  group  of  workers  managed  to  register  a  team  of  candidates  to  compete  for  the \nunion’s  presidency  without  being  defeated  behind  the  scenes. Throughout these two decades, the \ncompany  and  the  co-opted  union  movement  itself  alleged  a  lack  of  opposition  among  workers, \nstifling  the  company’s  permissive  influence  and  workers’  dissatisfaction.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nVale rigorously complies with legislation and respects union freedom and collective bargaining. We \nenter into collective agreements with all the unions that represent our employees and the decisions \nof   workers’   assemblies   are  sovereign  and  fully  respected  by  the  company.

Os moradores já notam que algumas nascentes estão assoreadas e que \na vazão dos cursos  d’água  diminuiu  consideravelmente,  além  dos problemas decorrentes da poeira \nda  mina  e  da  poluição  do  ar  também  terem  se  agravado  muito.  Mesmo  assim,  a  Vale  planeja \nreabrir  a  mina  Tamanduá,  que  estava  fora  de  atividade  há  cerca  de  quinze  anos.  Esta  mina \nlocaliza-se ainda mais próxima da comunidade do Morro da Água Quente, e perigosamente perto \nda  fonte  de  água  que  abastece  a  sede  do  município  de  Catas  Altas.  Ou  seja,  as  duas  fontes  de \nabastecimento  da  cidade  estão  em  risco  devido  às  operações  da  Vale.  Trata-se  da  segurança \nhídrica de mais de cinco mil pessoas.  \n\nOutro  grave  conflito  de  uso  da  água  pela  Vale  se  encontra  no  modal  de  escoamento  dos \nminerodutos, onde a polpa do minério de ferro é bombeada através da água durante 24 horas por \ndia. A Samarco (empresa em que a Vale detém 50% das ações) opera três minerodutos em Minas \nGerais, que saem da mina Alegria, em Mariana, e vão até o porto do Ubu, em Anchieta, no Espírito \nSanto.  Cada  um  deles  possui  mais  de  400  km  de  extensão.  Os  três  minerodutos  gastam  uma \nmédia de 4.400m³/hora. Depois de décadas destruindo os mananciais dos municípios de Mariana e \nOuro Preto, a empresa precisou captar água para os minerodutos e as usinas da Samarco no Rio \nConceição,  localizado  no  distrito  de  Brumal,  na  cidade  de  Santa  Bárbara.  A  adutora  construída \npara estes fins utiliza 82% do potencial hídrico do rio. Moradores da região informam que na época \nda estiagem o rio termina, literalmente, no ponto de  captação para o duto.  É importante ressaltar \nque, em 2010, um dos minerodutos da Samarco rompeu no município de Espera Feliz, causando \num grave desastre ambiental.” \n\nDestruição da Serra do Gandarela e de seus recursos hídricos \n\nHá  7  anos  o  Movimento  pela  Preservação  da  Serra  do  Gandarela,  do  qual  participam  diversas \norganizações e cidadãos de Minas Gerais e de todo o Brasil, atua no enfrentamento às pretensões \nminerárias  da  Vale.  A  Serra  do  Gandarela  abriga  a  última  grande  área  intacta  do  quadrilátero \nferrífero-aquífero e o mais importante aquífero e mananciais de água de alta qualidade da região, \nafluentes das bacias hidrográficas dos rios das Velhas (Bacia do Rio São Francisco) e Piracicaba \n(Bacia  do  Rio  Doce).  Por  esses  motivos,  a  sociedade  civil  organizada  solicitou  a  criação  de  um \nParque  Nacional  e  de  uma  Reserva  de  Desenvolvimento  Sustentável  (RDS).  Desconsiderando  a \nenorme  relevância  ambiental,  paisagística,  científica  e  cultural  da  região,  assim  como  o  amplo \ndebate  social  sobre  o  tema  e  sua  tramitação  no  âmbito  técnico  do  Instituto  Chico  Mendes  de \nConservação  da  Biodiversidade (ICMBio), o  Ministério do Meio Ambiente (MMA) encaminhou  e a \npresidente Dilma Rousseff criou, através de decreto em 13 de outubro de 2014, o Parque Nacional \nda  Serra  do  Gandarela[33],  sem  contemplar  em  sua  demarcação  as  áreas  que  reúnem  o  maior \nnúmero  de  atributos  que  justificam  a  criação  da  Unidade  de  Conservação  federal.

Em um período em que \nhá graves ameaças ao abastecimento de água e conflitos de uso na própria região Sudeste, não \nfaz  nenhum  sentido  criar  um  Parque  Nacional  excluindo  de  seus  limites  áreas  de  extrema \nrelevância ambiental e  hídrica.

Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts of water \nare used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. \n\nWater  is  the  mining   sector’s   main  input,  and  it  is  used  in  processing  and  transporting  ore.  The \nimpacts  of  this  activity  on  water  are  extremely  serious,  including  the  destruction  of  underground \nwater tables, deterioration of water quality when it is returned compared to when it was extracted, a \nreduction  in  its  availability,  and  contamination  of  rivers,  seas  and  springs  with  chemical  waste, \namong  other  things.  Thus,  mining  harms  not  just  the  use  of  water,  but  also  its  accumulation  and \nrenewal, causing an end to springs. Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts \nof water are used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. In just one hour \nof  operation,  these  pipelines  use  enough  water  to  supply  a  city  of  at  least  500,000  inhabitants \nduring  this  period.  In  2012,  there  were  more  permits  for  water  use  in  mining  than  in  industry  in \nBrazil. \n\nIn Canada, Vale’s  Voisey’s  Bay nickel mining project is very controversial due to the contamination \nof  Sandy  Pond,  which  had  a  unique  ecosystem.  Used  as  a  dumping  ground  for  waste,  the  pond \nwas  converted  into  a  basin  containing  more  than  400,000  metric  tons  of  waste,  according  to \ncomplaints from local organizations. As well as  Vale being the defendant in the largest public civil \nlawsuit  in   Canada’s   history   for   environmental  problems,  in  2010  it  was  sentenced  to  pay  around \nC$36 million (Canadian dollars) as compensation to more than 7,000 residents of Port Colborne in \nOntario.  \n\nIn Minas Gerais, Vale’s  birthplace,  there are numerous cases of conflicts between the use of water \nfor the company’s  operations  and  to  supply  the  population. In the municipality of Catas Altas, Vale \nextracts  iron  ore  from  São  Luiz  Mine  in  the  district  of  Morro  da  Água  Quente.  This  mine  was \nexpanded  in  2007,  and  mining  has  since  taken  place  very  near  the  community   and   the   district’s  \nwater  supply  source.  Residents  have  noted  that  some  springs  are  silting  up  and  that  the  flow  of \nwatercourses has reduced considerably. In addition, problems arising  from  the  mine’s  dust  and  air  \npollution have also become much worse. Despite this, Vale plans to reopen Tamanduá Mine, which \nwas  inactive  for  around  15  years.  This mine  is  located  even  closer  to  the  community  of  Morro  da \nÁgua  Quente,  and  dangerously  near  the  water  source  that  supplies  the  main  town  in  the \nmunicipality of Catas Altas. In  other  words,  the  town’s  two  water  sources  are  jeopardized  by  Vale’s  \noperations. The water security of more than 5,000 people is at stake. \n\nAnother serious conflict  regarding  Vale’s  water  use  is  found  in  its ore slurry pipelines, in which iron \nore slurry is pumped using water for 24 hours a day. Samarco (a company in which Vale has a 50% \nstake) operates three ore slurry pipelines in Minas Gerais, from Alegria Mine in Mariana to the Port \nof  Ubu  in  Anchieta,  Espírito  Santo.  Each  of  these  pipelines  is  more  than  400  km  long.  The  three \npipelines consume an average of  4,400 m³ of water per hour. After decades destroying springs in \nthe municipalities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, the company needed to extract water for  Samarco’s \nore  slurry  pipelines  and  plants  from  the  Conceição  River,  located  in  the  district  of  Brumal,  in  the \nmunicipality  of  Santa  Bárbara.  The  water pipe built for this  purpose uses  82%  of  the  river’s   water \npotential. Residents of the region say that in the dry season, the river literally dries up completely at \nthe   water   pipe’s   inflow   point.  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  2010,  one  of  Samarco’s   ore   slurry  \npipelines burst in the municipality of Espera Feliz, causing a major environmental disaster. \n\nDestruction of Gandarela Hills and their water resources \n\nFor  seven  years,  the  Movement  to  Preserve  the  Gandarela  Hills,  featuring  the  involvement  of \nvarious organizations and citizens from Minas Gerais and across Brazil, has been fighting against \nVale’s  mining  plans.

For these reasons, organized civil  society requested the creation  of a National  Park \nand  a  Sustainable  Development  Reserve.  Disregarding   the   region’s   enormous   environmental, \nlandscape, scientific and cultural relevance, as well as extensive social debate about the topic and \nits processing within the technical scope of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation \n(ICMBio),  the  Environment  Ministry  submitted  plans  for,  and  President  Dilma  Rousseff  created, \nthrough  a  decree  on  October  13,  2014,  the  Gandarela  Hills  National  Park[33],  without  including \nwithin its boundaries the areas with the largest number of attributes that justified the creation of the \nfederal Conservation Unit. Thus, they endangered this priceless social and environmental heritage, \nirreparably  harming  essential  water  sources  for  neighboring  municipalities,  such  as  Caeté,  Nova \nLima, Raposos, Rio Acima, Santa Bárbara and Barão de Cocais, as well as the last strategic water \nreserve to supply Belo Horizonte and its metropolitan region. At a time when there are serious water \nsupply   threats   and   usage   conflicts   in   Brazil’s   Southeast   region,  it  does  not  make  any  sense  to \ncreate  a  National  Park  whose  boundaries  exclude  areas  of  extreme  environmental  and  water \nresource  relevance.  It  makes  even  less  sense  to  permit  mining  exploration  there,  especially  that \nplanned  by  Vale  through  its  Apolo,  Piacó  and  Baú  projects.  Vale  made  efforts  to  reduce  the \nNational   Park’s   area.  Since  2007,  the  company  has  been  insisting  on  implementing  its  mining \nprojects in the region, and to this end it has made various attempts to get Apolo Mine licensed. This \ncompany, therefore, does not respect the importance of the Gandarela Hills, not even to guarantee \nwater for millions of people.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nApolo Project \n\nVale  began  studies  for  the  Apolo  Project  around  2006,  conducting  hydrogeological  studies  that \nsupported  the  respective  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  in  its  diagnosis  and  prognosis  of  the \nproject’s   impacts   on   the   region’s   water   resources.  The  results  of  these  studies  indicate  that  the \nApolo Project will not harm the water supply of Belo Horizonte and adjacent cities, and any impacts \nwill  be  duly  mitigated  in  line  with  prevailing  environmental  legislation  and  demands  by  the \nenvironmental licensing authority. \n\nThe Apolo Project’s  area  is  home  to  the water supply sources for the cities of Barão de Cocais and \nCaeté,  and  part  of  the  city  of  Belo  Horizonte.  The  main  allegation  against  the  project  among \norganized civil society is that there are several springs in its area of influence and that this is likely \nto affect the water supply of part of the local population. \n\nAlso regarding water supply issues, considering the study to evaluate water availability in the basins \nof the upper stretches of the Velhas and Paraopeba rivers, which are home to springs that feed the \nmetropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, COPASA’s  water  extraction  facility  from  the Velhas River is \nlocated around 7 km upstream from where it is joined by the Prata Stream, which is the watercourse \ninfluenced by the Apolo Project’s  implementation  area. \n\nTherefore, we  clarify  that  the  project’s  area  of  influence  is  not  related  to  the  water  extraction  points  \nused for the water supply in question. In addition, all water withdrawal points that currently supply \nthe metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte are located in areas of influence of mining projects, but no \nimpacts by these projects  on  water stocks allocated for public supply  have  ever been detected or \nforecast.  We  also  stress  that  in  our  environmental  controls,  we  have  also  created  an  extensive \nnetwork to monitor indicators, such as the quality and flow of watercourses. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Since then, the project has not moved forward. It is currently suspended. \n\nIt is important to note that Vale will only start implementing the Apolo Project once its environmental \nlicense has been duly approved, and in accordance with prevailing environmental legislation. \n\nCatas Altas \n\nIn 2010, Vale obtained an operating license to expand its activities at São Luiz Mine. \n\nVale clarifies that its activities do not interfere with water extraction points used to supply the district \nof Morro da Água Quente  and Catas Altas, which are found upstream  from  the  mine’s  operations. \nThe company monitors the flow and quality of water in the watercourses located around the project. \nThe  results  of  this  monitoring  have  been  in  accordance  with  the  parameters  determined  by \nlegislation. \n\nWith regard to particulate matter emissions, the company takes measures to control dust and it has \nan  air  quality  monitoring  network  to  measure  particulate  levels  in  the  area  around  the  operation. \nThe monitoring results have been within the limits determined by legislation. \n\nAll this monitoring work is officially registered with the environmental authority, in accordance with \nthe  operating  license’s  conditions. \n\nSamarco \n\n The   water   resource   management   is   a   fundamental   issue   on   Samarco’s   operations   and   plans.  \nSeveral  studies  and  project  have  being  developed  in  order  to  adopt  more  sustainable  practices. \nThis  work  is  oriented  by  the  aims  of  optimize  and  rationalize  the  water  use,  reduce  the  need  of \nmake-up  water,  increase  recirculation  water  rate  and  ensure  the  water  quality  discarded  to \nenvironment. \n\nIt’s   important   to   highlight   that   Samarco   does   not   withdraw   water   specifically   to   feed   the   pipelines.  \nThe water to the transport came from iron ore processing withdraw. So, regardless the pipeline, the \nwithdraw water is necessary due the industrial process nature. Part of water is treated and returns \nto water bodies close to company with quality level according the law requirements. About 90% of \nwater demanded by Samarco is recycled and the part used on pipeline is separated and used again \nin the pelletizing process in Espírito Santo. Those initiatives avoid, in large scale, the need of new \nwithdraw out of the environment. Nowadays Samarco uses 1632m3/h of water to transport ore pulp \nand not 4400m3/h as described. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAll   Samarco’s   withdraw   is   conducted   according   the   standards   established   by   the   authorizations  \nissued  for  the  competent  environmental  agency  after  conducted  studies  attesting  the  viability. \nSamarco has permits in five different places in order to avoid water stress in a particular place. \n\nThe  water  withdrawal  on  Santa  Bárbara  river  is  part  of  its  strategy  and  started  with  the  third \nconcentration plant operation launched on April 2014. The information about the use of 82% of the \nriver  capacity  is  unfounded.  According  to  the  IGAM  Ordinance  nº49/2010,  article  5º,  §1º,   “The \nmaximum limit of consumption withdraws to be permitted in the portion of water basing limited for a \nconsidered section, in natural conditions, will be 30% of Q7,10 (minimum flow rate in 7 (seven) days \nand  10  (ten)  years  of  recurrence)  being  assured  downstream  of  the  withdraw  minimum  residual \nflows  equal  of  70%  of  the  Q7,10”.  So,  the  water  used  by  Samarco  doesn’t  restrict others withdraws \nin  different  points  of  Santa  Bárbara  river.  As  established  by  the  law  above    on  that  specific  point \nwould be  allowed  withdraw of 3467m3/h and Samarco is allowed to  withdraw up to 2050m3/h, as \nthe flow rate defined by the permit – “Portaria  de  Outorga  Nº01323/2001”.   \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  in  2012  was  published  the  Resolution  SEMAD-IGAM  nº1548,  March \n29th, 2012 changing the permitted withdraw flow rate to 50% of Q7,10. On this conditions would be \nallowed to withdraw 5778m3/h on that point of Santa Bárbara river. \n\nThe  Federal  law  13199/99  (National  law  of  waters)  item  I,  Art.  3º  established  “the  right  of  access  of  \nall   to   water   resources,   priority   to   public   supply   and   ecosystem   maintenance”.   So   the   Samarco’s  \nwithdraws do not compete with human supply. In 38 years of pipelines operation there is no records \nof conflicts for water use in the neighborhood of company operations. \n\nRelated to the pipeline leaking in 2010 it should be noticed this is a localized occurrence identified \nand treated by the company with agility and transparency. \n\nSamarco,  immediately  after  the  identification  of  the  occurrence  informed  and  involved  the \ncompetent  authorities  and  took  care  of  all  work  to  rehabilitate  the  area.  The  action  was  properly \nfollowed  by  the  competent  authority  and  received  the  municipality  formal  recognition  for  the \ncompany responsibility and especially for the way of conduction the actions related to the fact. \n\nVoyces Bay \n\nVale is committed to long term sustainable development  – Vale’s  approach to sustainability entails \nbalancing environmental, social and economic factors from a macro perspective to achieve a result \nthat prioritizes the greater good and the best interests of the communities in which it operates.  The \noutcomes  of  the  Sandy  Pond  and   Port   Colborne   legal   matters   demonstrate   Vale’s   respect   for   the  \nenvironment and record of compliance with prevailing laws and regulations.  \n\nSandy Pond  \n\nThe  “Sandy  Pond  Alliance  for  the  Protection  of  Canadian  Waters”  filed an Application in the Federal \nCourt of Canada in June 2010  asking that  the  Metal  Mining Effluent  Regulations (\"MMER\")  under \nthe Fisheries Act, which permit the use of a lake or pond as a Tailings Impoundment Area (\"TIA\"), \nbe  declared  void  and  unlawful.  The  Application  does  not  seek  a  specific  remedy  or  order  against \nVale  but  rather  named  the  Government  of  Canada  and  challenged  the  Government  decision  to \nenact certain MMER provisions. The Sandy Pond Alliance position was that the Fisheries Minister \nand the Cabinet were not authorized under the Fisheries Act to enact regulations which permit the \nuse  of  a  fish  habitat  (i.e.,  a  lake  or  pond)  for  tailings,  the  result  of  which  is  the  destruction  of \nfreshwater aquatic life in the habitat. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe  Court  dismissed  the  Sandy  Pond  Application  on  31  October  2013  (meaning,  the  Court \ndetermined that MMER are not unlawful).  The status of this matter is that the Sandy Pond Alliance \napplication was rejected by the Court without impact to Vale.   \n\nThe  Sandy  Pond  site  emerged  as  the  clear  and  most  responsible  selection  after  detailed \nexamination and comparison of several possible sites for the RSF.  A requirement related to the use \nof  Sandy  Pond  is  the  protection  of  fish  and  fish  habitat  under  the  Fisheries  Act  of  Canada.  The \nDepartment  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans   (DFO)   operates   on   the   “No   Net   Loss”   principle:   any   loss   of  \nproductive  fish  habitat  has  to  be  offset  in  an  acceptable  manner  so  that  there  is  no  net  loss  in \ncapacity.  Fish  habitat  can  be  altered  only  if  authorized  by  the  Minister  of  Fisheries.  Such \nauthorization  is  granted  only  if  an  acceptable  Fish  Habitat  Compensation  Plan  is  in  place  and  a \nbinding agreement is reached on its implementation. \n\nVale has legally relocated the freshwater aquatic life from Sandy Pond and continues to responsibly \nuse  Sandy  Pond   as   a   residue   storage   site   for   Vale’s   Long   Harbour   processing   plant   operations.    \nThis  is  all  in  accordance  with  prevailing  laws  and  regulations.    The  Sandy  Pond  residue  storage \nfacility (RSF) is one of 19 authorized impoundment areas in Canada. \n\nPCR Class Action Lawsuit \n\nA  class  action  lawsuit  in  Ontario  court  alleged  that  historic  emissions   from   Vale’s   Port   Colborne  \nrefinery had resulted in elevated nickel levels in the soil  and adversely affected property values of \nneighboring properties.  Vale acknowledged that there is nickel in the soil and that the majority of it \ncame  from  the  historical  (pre-1960)  operation  of  the  nickel  refinery  in  Port  Colborne.  Vale  put \nforward the position that the refinery was at all times operated in compliance with the environmental \nregulation  of  the  day  and  that  the  level  of  nickel  in  soil  was  below  the  standards  set  to  protect \nhuman health.  \n\nAt trial, the judge awarded damages to the Class Action plaintiffs in the amount of CDN$36 million \nplus  legal  costs.  This  decision  was  subsequently  reversed  by  the  Ontario  Court  of  Appeal, \naccepting  all  of  Vale’s  positions.  Thus  no  payment  by  Vale  to the Plaintiffs was required.  \n\nVale  recognizes  the  historical  soil  contamination  and  has  worked  to  undertake  Risk  Assessments \n(RAs),  as  required  by  the  Ontario  Ministry  of  the  Environment  (MOE).  The  RAs  evaluated  human \nhealth risk, ecological risk and risk to agricultural crops.  The studies provided further evidence that \nthe level of soil contamination does not represent a health risk to the  community.  The  MOE’s  review  \nof  Vale’s  RAs  is  ongoing.  Vale  continues  to  implement  its  risk  management  plan  to  address  areas  \nwith higher nickel soil contamination. \n\n17)  Xikrin: compensation programs \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “No  Pará,  o  povo  Xikrin  realizou  diversos  protestos  em  2014.

During  one  of \nthem, the  entrance  to  Vale’s  Onça Puma project in the Ourilândia do Norte region was blocked and \nproduction  halted.  The  indigenous  people  allege  that  nickel  mining  is  causing  extensive  harm  to \npeople’s   health   and   affecting   the   Cateté  River,  which  serves  the  community.  According  to  the \nFederal Prosecution Ministry, despite the health impacts on the Xikrin people, Vale has not begun \nany  compensation  program  and  has  not  complied  with  any  of  the  established  conditions.  Another \nVale  project,  the  Salobo  copper  extraction  project,  is  also  causing  negative  consequence  for  this \nsame people, by affecting areas where they collect nuts. For this reason, Salobo is the object of a \npublic civil inquiry under way at the Federal Prosecutor’s  Office  in  Marabá, Pará.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nOnça Puma \n\nAll  the  stages  of  the  Onça  Puma  project  were  planned  so  as  to  prevent  and  safeguard  the \nindigenous  people  and  their  territories  from  any  negative  consequences  that  may  arise  from  its \nimplementation or during its operational phase.  \n\nVale  also  understands  that,  following  the  completion  of  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté  Ethno-Ecological \nStudies,  which  detailed  the  impacts  on  these  indigenous  areas  more  directly,  and  proposed \nmitigating  actions,  strategies  and  measures  for  them,  any  detailed  information  needed  for  the \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA-RIMA)  has  already  been  supplied.  Based  on  the  impacts \nidentified  in  this  study,  a  Basic  Environmental  Plan  featuring  appropriate  mitigation  programs  was \nproduced  with  the  indigenous  community  participation.  However,  the  indigenous  people  are  not \nallowing  the  programs  that  were  defined,  with  their  participation  and  decision,  to  be  implemented \nwithin their indigenous land. They want extra financial resources to be paid by the company for their \nconsumption needs. The mitigation plan is established to have the financial resources being applied \nin  environmental  conservation,  health,  safety  improvement,  land  securing  and  monitoring,  cultural \nstrengthening  and  productive  activities,  in  an  equitable  way.  They  are  not  supposed  to  pay  for \ncosting  and  acquisition  of  consumer  goods  that  have  no  correlation  with  the  impacts  and  often \ngenerate  new  negative  impacts  to  these  populations,  including  their  socio-cultural  aspects  and \nhealth.   The direct financial transfer is not either equitably distributed by them. Therefore, some get \nmore  resources  than  others,  generating  new  internal  ruptures.  The  simple  increase  of  resources \nposes more threat to these people. A strong long term sustainable plan with good governance and \nmanagement  is  needed.    Vale  has  been  conducting  all  the  activities  outside  the  indigenous  land \ndefined in the Basic Environmental Plan, including the following: (i) Monitoring of water quality in the \nXikrin do Cateté indigenous land (monitoring of concentrations of heavy metals that could affect the \nindigenous  people’s  health);;  and  (ii)  Actions  to  mitigate  the  silting of the Cateté River (proposal for \nstructures to control this silting). This monitoring work has shown no change in turbidity that could \ninfluence   the   water   body’s   visual   characteristics.   Regarding   heavy   metals,   the   anomalies   found  \n(higher  concentrations)  are  related  to  regional  and/or  local  geology,  including  hydro-chemical \nprocesses,  water-rock  interactions,  the  time  that  water  spends  in  the  aquifer,  and  speed  of \ninfiltration. \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  since  1982  Vale  has  provided  support  to  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté \nindigenous  people,  complementing  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  Brazilian  state,  providing \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The project is fully \nsituated inside the Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest, a conservation unit protected by the competent \nenvironmental  authority,  and  human  occupation  in  the  location  is  prohibited.  Due  to  the \nconsiderable distance between the project and the indigenous villages where the  Xikrin do Cateté \npeople  live,  as  well  as  the  strict  environmental  control  systems  inherent  to  the  project,  these \ncircumstances  allow  us  to  affirm  that  there  are  no  significant  impacts  on  the  physical,  biotic  and \nsocioeconomic  environment  affecting  the  indigenous  land.  Discussions  have  been  held  with  the \nXikrin do Cateté people since the start of the Salobo Project. Although  they  did  not  use  the  project’s  \narea  before  it  began,  their  use  of  this  area  has  since  been  facilitated,  thereby  expanding  their \noptions  for  collecting  nuts  –  a  traditional  activity  that  the  company  now  supports  annually  on  a \nvoluntary basis. \n\n18)  Mãe Maria Indigenous Land \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “Em  2015,  o  MPF  pediu  à  Justiça  Federal  que  obrigue  a  mineradora \nVale a voltar imediatamente a dar apoio à saúde dos indígenas da Terra Indígena Mãe Maria, em \nBom Jesus do Tocantins, no sudeste do Pará.

With regard to food prices, notwithstanding \nfactors  such  as  seasonal  situations,  crop  failures  and  sales  obstacles,  the  technical  supervisor  of \nthe Pará Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese), Roberto Sena, \nbelieves there is a relationship between the advance of palm trees and the rise in food prices.The \nproblem of family farming is the lack of a production policy; people have stopped growing cassava \nin  favor  of  palm  trees,’  he  says.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nBiopalma operates strictly according to labor and environmental legislation, and it clarifies that it has \nhad access to the “Technical report to evaluate surface water and bottom sediment located in areas \npotentially  impacted  by  palm  oil  tree  cultivation  in  the  municipalities  of  Concórdia  do  Pará  and \nBujaru,” produced by the Evandro Chagas Institute. This document does not contain any evidence \nof  pesticide-contaminated  surface  water,  and  its  analyses  of  sediments  detected  residues  of  DDT \nand Endossulfan – products that are not used by Biopalma. \n\nThe  company  emphasizes  that  it  does  not  have  any  activities  inside  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion.  Despite  this,  it  carries  out  sustainable  projects  to  support  the  indigenous  community, \nfocused  on  education,  health, \nfood  security,  basic  sanitation,  maintenance,  and  access \ninfrastructure.  For  example,  the  company  has  equipped  a  health  center  and  installed  micro  water \nsupply  facilities,  among  other  things,  all  in  accordance  with  the  ethno-environmental  report \nproduced in 2011 and updated in August 2012, and under Funai’s  supervision. \n\nIt should be noted that despite the actions taken by Biopalma to support the indigenous community \nof the Turé Mariquita territory, on December 24, 2014 indigenous person Lucinho Tembé began to \nlead  a  series  of  illegal  actions  against  the  company,  including  the  unlawful  seizure  of  vehicles, \ninterruptions of activities, threats to company employees, and theft of objects and fuel. In exchange \nfor the seized goods, the indigenous people presented a series of demands, which included, among \nother materials items, a monthly transfer of cash unconnected to any actions. The goods were only \nrecovered by Biopalma following a court ruling by the judge of the Second Federal Court of Belém. \nWe  emphasize  that  there  is  no  proof  of  any  impacts  caused  by  Biopalma’s   activities   on   the  \nindigenous territory. In addition, the study conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute did not cover \nthe municipality of Tome Açu, where the indigenous community in question is located. \n\nThus,  the  Federal  Prosecution  Ministry  filed  Injunction  in  order  to  investigate  the  alleged \ncontamination  of  the  indigenous  territory.  Biopalma  was  summoned  and  it  presented  its  defense. \nFollowing the legal procedures, the lawsuit was dismissed  by the judge of the Ninth Federal Court \nof Belém. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n34 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEven  though  the  lawsuit  was  dismissed,  Biopalma    started  to  hold  meetings  with  the  indigenous \ncommunity  and  FUNAI  with  the  aim  at  reaching  an  agreement  to  ensure  good  relations  with  the \nparties  involved.  The  indigenous  leaders  have  presented  their  claims  and  Biopalma  is  evaluating \ntheir  pertinence in relation  to their areas of activity, namely  education, health, food security,  basic \nsanitation, maintenance, and access infrastructure. At the moment there are no direct conflicts.  \n\nRegarding the allegation of deforestation,  it should be noted that the  Biopalma project has a  zero \nrate of deforestation, as it is exclusively planting palm trees in areas already altered, in line with the \nobligations  arising  from  environmental  legislation  and  the  company’s   objectives  and  principles  to \nconserve the biodiversity and ecosystem around it. As a result, the company is maintaining natural \nareas  of  habitat,  thereby  contributing  to  environmental  balance  and  the  conservation  of  natural \nresources in the region. \n\nIn the last six (6) months, it was identified that the  company’s  areas  allocated for “Reserva Legal”  \nsites  (legally  mandated  minimum  areas  of  native  habitat)  and/or  considered  Permanent \nPreservation  areas  have  been  systematically  invaded  for  illegal  logging,  especially  in  the \nmunicipalities of Acará, Tomé Açú and Concórdia do Pará. \n\nIn order to reduce incidents of illegal logging, Biopalma filed crime reports at the police station in the \nmunicipality where each property in question is located, and made a request to the Pará Specialist \nEnvironmental Police Department (DEMA) to launch a police inquiry to put a definitive end to such \nactions,  which  harm  not  only  the  company,  but  society  as  a  whole.  Biopalma  has  also  reported \nthese cases to the environmental authorities.  As a result of the measures taken by  Biopalma, the \nCivil  Police  have  already  carried  out  two  operations  in  the  region,  culminating  in  the  seizure  of \nillegally extracted timber.  \n\nRegarding the aforementioned territorial conflicts, Biopalma states that at no time has it made any \nkind  of  threats  to  rural  farmers  located  in  the  region  to  sell  their  lands,  and  it  has  certainly  not \nundertaken  any  planting  work  and/or  acquired  properties  belonging  to  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion. As stated before, Biopalma has been planting in already degraded areas. \n\nWith  regard  to  the  conflict  with  the  quilombola  community,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  request  to \ndemarcate  the  Amarqualta  quilombola  territory  was  filed  in  2011,  after  Biopalma  acquired  the \nproperties.  As  soon  as  it  became  aware  of  the  request  for  quilombola  demarcation,  the  company \nsuspended the planting of palm trees in the contested area and began to monitor the demarcation \nprocess with the Pará Land Institute (ITERPA), the body responsible for the process of demarcating \nquilombola  territory.  Alongside  the  administrative  process  under  way  at  ITERPA,  the  State  Public \nProsecution Ministry instigated a public civil inquiry to investigate the claims made by the members \nof the quilombola community regarding the activities of palm tree-growing companies, particularly in \nterms of land conflicts involving an area that is awaiting land title. Because of these administrative \nprocesses, Biopalma has had several meetings with ITERPA, the quilombola communities and the \nState  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  to  resolve  the  situation  through  negotiation.  At  the  moment,  the \nvalidity  of  the  land  titles  for  overlapping  properties  claimed  by  Biopalma  and  ITERPA  is  being \nevaluated. \n\nLaunched  in  February  2010,  Biopalma’s   Family   Farming   Program  consists  of  a  partnership  to \nproduce  palm  oil  fruit  with  rural  farming  families  in  northeast  Pará.  The  farmers  are  funded  via \nBanco  da  Amazônia,  Banco  do  Brasil  and  Banco  do  Estado  do  Pará  (Banpará),  with  credit  lines \nsupplied  by  the  National  Program  to  Strengthen  Family  Farming  (PRONAF  –  ECO  DENDÊ),  a \nfederal  government  program  to  acquire  saplings,  maintain  plantations  and  grant  financial  support \nfor subsistence needs in the first three years after planting until the first crops are harvested. \n\nAround  650  families  are  partners  of  this  Biopalma  program,  dedicating  part  of  their  lands  to  palm \ntree  plantations  and  receiving  technical  assistance,  as  well  as  guaranteed  purchases  of  raw \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n35 \n\n \n \n \n\fmaterials  for  30  years  of  production.  Farmers  already  at  the  harvesting  stage,  i.e.  at  least  three \nyears  after  planting,  have  seen  a  significant  increase  in  their  purchasing  power,  which  is  also \nresulting in growth in the acquisition of goods and services in  the  program’s  areas of influence. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  to  strengthen  family  farming  among  the  producers  served  by  the  program, \nBiopalma  conducts  monitoring  and  provides  technical  support  needed  for  the  families  to  develop \ntheir agricultural production, given that they also grow other crops on the same property. \n\nOne  of  the  ways  used  to  encourage  families  to  plant  a  variety  of  crops  is  the  “Productivity  Trio,” a \nprogram  formalized  through  a  partnership  between  Biopalma  and  Embrapa  that  involves  a \ncombination of three components of a cassava production system and their application at the family \nproperties in question.  \n\nThe Productivity Trio has the capacity to  use the spaces between  the rows of palm trees to grow \ncassava  roots  without  harming  the  perfect  plant  development  of  the  palm  trees.  The  Productivity \nTrio  has  been  implemented  in  cleared  areas  where  the  slash  and  burn  technique  had  previously \nbeen usual. By using the Trio system, it has been possible to double cassava yields  without using \nfertilizer, by focusing on using the best spacing to plant seedlings, clearing the areas and selecting \ncassava seedlings. As the planted palm trees take  three  years to begin producing fruit, and given \nthat cassava crops are the foundation of family farming in the area, cassava is grown between the \nrows of palm trees, in line with the following principles: \n\n  Non-encouragement of monoculture in family farming; \n\n  Diversification  of  production,  given  that  many  other  crops  besides  cassava  may  be \nintercropped (including corn, rice, beans and  watermelon), provided that technical spacing \ncriteria are followed, as guided by Biopalma’s  technical  team; \n\n  Guaranteed food security for the families benefited by Biopalma’s  Family  Farming  Program; \n\n  Guaranteed income even before oil palm fruit production begins,  given that the palm trees \n\ncomplement income produced by other food crops (beans, corn, rice and fruits). \n\nBiopalma  is  a  company  with  the  mission  to  produce  palm  oil  and  byproducts  in  a  sustainable \nmanner.  Our  operational  excellence  makes  us  a  leading  company  in  the  market,  and  this \nrecognition  has  only  been  possible  thanks  to  work  performed  with  respect  for  safety  and  the \nenvironment. \n\n20)  Belo Monte \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Um dos projetos mais polêmicos em que a Vale está envolvida, na sua \ncrescente busca por energia, é a construção da usina hidrelétrica de Belo Monte na Volta Grande \ndo Rio Xingu, no estado do Pará.

As  motivações  para  a  redução  da  sua \nparticipação  no  Nesa  não  são  totalmente  claras.  Os  grandes  atrasos  na  construção  e  as \nconstantes  atualizações  de  custos  evidenciam  que  Belo  Monte  não  é  economicamente  viável, \ncomo os movimentos sociais apontam há décadas.” \n\nEnglish version: “One  of   the  most  controversial  projects  in   which   Vale   is  involved,  in  its   growing  \npursuit of energy, is the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant in the Volta Grande (“Big  \nBend”)  of  the  Xingu River, in the state of Pará.

Major  delays  in  construction  and  constant  cost  increases \ndemonstrate that Belo Monte is not economically viable, as social movements have been saying for \ndecades.” \n\nVale’s Response \n\nIn March 2015, Vale transferred its 9% stake in Norte Energia Participações S.A. (the Belo Monte \nhydroelectric  power  plant)  to  Aliança  Norte  Energia  Participações  (Aliança  Norte),  a  joint  venture \nbetween Vale and Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nVale now indirectly holds a 4.59% interest in Belo Monte, while Cemig GT has a 4.41% stake in the \nproject through Aliança Norte. This  reduction  in  Vale’s  interest  in  Belo Monte is in line with its global \nstrategy  to  focus  on  its  core  business,  without  harming  the  availability  of  electric  power  for  its \noperations. \n\nThrough  Aliança  Norte,  Vale  appoints  one  member  and  a  respective  alternate  member  to  Norte \nEnergia’s   Board   of   Directors,   with   the   right   to   one   vote   at   meetings,   where   subjects   need   to   be  \napproved  by  a  vote  of  at  least  eight  members.  Vale  and  Cemig  GT  alternately  appoint  Aliança \nNorte’s   member   of   the   Board   of   Directors   every   three   years,   as   determined   in   Aliança   Norte’s  \nshareholders agreement. \n\nEnvironmental and social issues, among other strategic topics, are discussed by the Environmental \nAdvisory  Committee,   whose   members   are   appointed   by   Norte   Energia’s   shareholders.   Vale,  \nthrough  Aliança  Norte,  appoints  one  representative  to  this  committee  and  a  respective  alternate \nmember  until  the  end  of  the  Belo  Monte  hydroelectric  project’s  implementation  phase.  Starting from \nthe  operational  phase,  Cemig  GT  and  Vale  will  then  alternately  appoint  their  representative  every \nthree   years.   The   committee’s   main   objective   is   to   analyze   social   and   environmental   subjects   and  \nrecommend  whether  or  not  to  approve  measures  to  Norte  Energia’s   Board   of   Directors,   which   is  \ncomposed of 12 members appointed by shareholders \n\nNorte  Energia  provides  frequent  information  on  their  site.

There are also no plans to resettle villages, in line with the \nproject’s  commitment  to  reduce  its  impacts on the surrounding area and local communities. \n\nDuring  its  implementation  phase,  the  project  is  investing  around  R$4.23  billion  in  social  and \nenvironmental initiatives, of which R$2.74 billion had been spent by February 2015 (64% of the total \nplanned  amount).  The  management  of  social  and  environmental  aspects  is  guided  by  the  Basic \nEnvironmental  Plan,  which  is  being  implemented  through  117  programs,  plans  and  projects, \nencompassing  social, \ninvestments,  aimed  at \ncompensating  for  and  mitigating  the  potential  impacts  identified  in  the  environmental  viability \nstudies.  \n\nland-related  and  physical-biotic \n\nindigenous, \n\nSocial investments in local municipalities and indigenous communities represent around 60% of the \nbudget, covering social, cultural, economic and infrastructure aspects. \n\nThey include initiatives to  monitor and  improve health, education, training,  income generation and \nappreciation  of  cultural  and  intangible  heritage.  Of  these  investments,  108  projects  have  been \ncompleted  to  build  or  renovate  schools,  basic  health  centers  and  hospitals  (in  rural  and  urban \nareas), and by the end of the project there should be 136 new facilities. In programs for indigenous \npeople, more than R$226.3 million of the planned R$358.7 million has already been invested. \n\nAs part of social and environmental requirements related to the creation of Belo  Monte’s  reservoir,  \nwork  is  under  way  to  comply  with  the  National  Solid  Waste  Plan,  which  has  involved  remediating \nexisting dumps, completed in October 2012, and implementing sanitary landfills, in operation since \nearly  2013,  for  the  municipalities  of  Altamira  and  Vitória  do  Xingu,  benefiting  a  population  of \napproximately 120,000 people.  \n\nAlso  in  2013,  work  began  on  building  these  municipalities’   entire   water   and   sewage  systems, \ninvolving  investments  of  around  R$500  million  and  completed  in  late  2014,  significantly  improving \nthe way urban waste is disposed of in the region, where conditions used to be much worse than in \nBrazil as a whole. \n\nAs  the  reservoir  is  formed,  the  urban  population  living  in  areas  of  “palafitas”  (houses  on  stilts)  in  the  \ncity  of  Altamira  is  being  resettled  in  new  neighborhoods.

It is also important to emphasize \nthat  since  the  1980s  the  company  has  used  control  measures  to  impede  this  kind  of  occurrence, \nand has been conducting marine monitoring of the bay for 26 years. \n\nSechura   Bay   (Bahía   de   Sechura)   in   Peru,   located   near   Miski   Mayo   mining   company   (Vale’s  \nsubsidiary) is constantly monitored by OEFA, the Peruvian environmental inspection agency. OEFA \nensures   that   the   particulate  material   from   phosphate   rock   released   in   the   mining   company’s   truck  \nboarding area is within the limits established by law. Other renowned institutes in the country, such \nas the Technological Institute of Production (Instituto Tecnológico de la Producción  – ITP) and the \nPeruvian  Sea  Institute  (Instituto  del  Mar  del  Perú  –  IMARPE),  state  that  the  Sechura  Bay \ncontaminant factors are not related to the mining activity. Additionally, we report that the phosphate \nis transported in fully covered conveyor belts, which prevent contact of the product with the air. This \nmeasure is part of the continuous improvement action plan put in place by Miski Mayo in 2011. The \ncompany  reinforces  its  commitment  to  the  environmental  preservation  of  the  regions  where  it \noperates. In 2012 it urged authorities and other companies in the Piura region to join efforts towards \nproper sanitation in the Sechura Bay in Peru. As a result, in 2014 a Supreme Resolution (nº 288-\n2014-PCM) was issued and a number of meetings and participatory monitoring activities under this \ninitiative took place. As for the previous consultation in San Martin de Sechura; the process is not \ncarried out by the investment project lead, but by the relevant governmental body which, in the case \nof the mining sector in Peru, is the Ministry of Energy and Mines. In order to approve inception of \nMiski Mayo operations, the Ministry established that there was no need for a previous consultation, \ngiven that San Martín de Sechura Community is not an indigenous population. In addition to that, at \nthat particular moment, previous consultation processes had not been regulated by local legislation \n(which  entered  into  force  in  2011).  The  Vice  ministry  of  Intercultural  Affairs  within  the  Ministry  of \nCulture,  which  is  the  body  in  charge  of  recognizing  Indigenous  populations  in  Peru,  does  not \nacknowledge  the  presence  of  Indigenous  populations  in  the  Piura  department,  where  the  San \nMartín de Sechura community  is located. Even so, the company established a  lasting relationship \nwith neighborhood communities, providing them with information on the enterprise, clarifying doubts \nand  supporting  the  community  grievance  process,  which  is  fundamental  for  proper  social  impact \nmanagement.  \n\n22)  Piquiá de baixo, Açailândia, Maranhão \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “A luta pelo território em Piquiá de Baixo.

A  gravidade dos \nfatos,  bem  como  a  ausência  de  medidas  efetivas  por  parte  do  Estado  brasileiro  e  das  empresas \npara coibir a perpetuação das violações, fez com que, em 09 de janeiro de 2014, quatro Relatorias \nEspeciais  das  Nações  Unidas  solicitassem  ao  Estado  Brasileiro  informações  a  respeito  da \ncontaminação de que tem sido vítima a comunidade de Piquiá de Baixo. \n\nOs  Relatores  Especiais  das  Nações  Unidas  Anand  Grover,  sobre  o  direito  de  todos  ao  gozo  do \nmais alto nível de saúde  mental e física, Marc Pallemaerts, sobre as implicações para os direitos \nhumanos  da  disposição  e  gestão  ambientalmente  adequada  de  substâncias  e  dejetos  perigosos, \nCatarina  Albuquerque,  para  o  direito  humano  ao  saneamento  e  água  portável  e  Alexandra \nGuáqueta,  do  Grupo  de  Trabalho  sobre  direitos  humanos,  corporações  transnacionais  e  outras \nempresas,  solicitaram  ao  Estado  brasileiro  que  apresentasse  respostas  a  dez  perguntas  que \ncompreendem  desde  a  matéria  fática  até  as  medidas  preventivas  uti  lizadas  pelo  Estado  para \nevitar  que  as  atividades  das  empresas  sigam  provocando  os  mesmos  impactos  nos  direitos \nhumanos da comunidade, além das medidas de responsabilização das empresas envolvidas. \n\nPara  viabilizar  o  reassentamento  e,  na  falta  de  alternativas,  a  Associação  Comunitária  dos \nMoradores  do  Pequiá  assumiu  a  condução  do  processo  e  apresentou  projeto  de  financiamento \njunto à Caixa Econômica Federal, pelo Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida Entidades.

The  severity  of  the  facts  and  the  lack  of  effective \nmeasures taken by the Brazilian state and companies to curb the perpetuation of violations led the \nUnited Nations to submit four Special Reports to the Brazilian state on January 9, 2014, requesting \ninformation about the contamination that the community of Piquiá de Baixo has suffered. \n\nThe United Nations special rapporteurs Anand Grover (regarding the right of all people to enjoy the \nhighest  level  of  mental  and  physical  health),  Marc  Pallemaerts  (regarding  the  implications  for \nhuman  rights  of  the  environmentally  appropriate  disposal  and  management  of  dangerous \nsubstances and waste), Catarina Albuquerque (regarding the human right to sanitation and drinking \nwater)  and  Alexandra  Guáqueta  (a  member  of  the Working  Group  on  human  rights,  transnational \ncorporations  and  other  companies)  have  asked  the  Brazilian  state  to  present  responses  to  10 \nquestions ranging from factual matters to the preventive measures used by the state to prevent the \ncompanies’  activities  from  continuing  to  have  the  same  impacts on  the  community’s  human  rights, \nas well as measures to hold the companies involved liable. \n\nTo enable the resettlement and in the absence of any other options, the Community Association of \nResidents of Pequiá took over the process and submitted a funding proposal to  Caixa Econômica \nFederal  (CEF),  as   part   of   the   ‘Minha  Casa  Minha  Vida  Entidades’   public   housing   program.  The \nprogram’s   resources   will   pay  for  around  70%  of  the  work  to  build  the  houses  and  basic \ninfrastructure of the new neighborhood. The Vale Foundation and Maranhão State Pig Iron Industry \nAssociation  (SIFEMA)  made  a  commitment  to  the  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  to  provide  the \nremaining resources during this construction stage. In December 2014, the project was technically \napproved by CEF and since then it has been awaiting selection by the Cities Ministry. As part of the \nprocess  of  contracting  for  the  project,  the  parties  responsible  for  funding  the  construction  of  the \nnecessary public and social facilities have not  yet been determined. Vale, recognizing its share of \nthe  responsibility,  should  review  its  practices  to  ensure  that  its  operations  and  those  of  steel \ncompanies respect national and international  environmental  laws and standards regarding  air and \nwater quality.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nThe main source of the problems affecting the community of Piquiá de Baixo is pig iron production \nemissions  in  the  Açailândia  steelmaking  complex.  Vale  participates  in  the  production  chain  by \nsupplying iron ore and transporting pig iron. Despite that the impacts generated by pig iron plants \nare not directly related to Vale, which has not had any pig iron operations in the region since 2010, \nwhen  Vale  seized  and  sold  its  pig  iron  assets,  we  maintain  dialogue  with  the  community.  This \ndialogue, which has included local civil society organizations and the public authorities, is aimed at \ndiagnosing  the  problems  indicated  by  the  community  and  participating  in  solutions  arising  from \nindustrial activities in the pig iron chain. \n\nTo  meet  a  request  from  the  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  in  Açailândia,  Vale,  through  the  Vale \nFoundation, produced a socioeconomic diagnosis of the 330 families in the community in question. \nThis diagnosis involved extensive community participation, and was completed and submitted to the \nPublic  Prosecution  Ministry  at  the  start  of  2011.  During  the  process,  a  commission  of  30  families \nwas  established  to  represent  all  the  families  involved.  The  aim  of  this  work  was  to  identify  the \nfamilies’   profile,  involving  visits  to  support  the  project  to  construct  a  new  neighborhood  to  house \nthem, in line with the desire expressed by the community.  \n\nIn  October  2014,  the  Vale  Foundation  formally  entered  into  a  partnership  with  the  Community \nAssociation of Piquiá and CAIXA, undertaking to support the construction of 312 houses to rehouse \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Porém,  observa-se  nos  projetos  da  Vale  o  desenvolvimento  de \nprogramas paliativos, que se aproveitam da omissão do próprio Estado nas localidades.

A Fundação Vale funciona através de Parceria \nSocial  Público  Privada  que,  como  a  própria  empresa  designa,  é  um  pacto  entre  governo,  setor \nprivado e sociedade civil para a promoção do desenvolvimento dos territórios, gozando a empresa \nde  benefícios  de  isenção  fiscal.  O  que  não  se  evidencia  é  como  as  suas  atividades  de \nresponsabilidade  social  interferem  nos  processos  decisórios  nas  instâncias  públicas.  Um  caso \nexemplar são as parcerias com as Secretarias Municipais de Educação no oferecimento de cursos \npara  o  desenvolvimento  profissional  de  professores,  diretores  e  supervisores  das  escolas  que \nbuscam  a  formação  profissional  continuada.  Esses  cursos,  organizados  e  realizados  pela \nFundação  Vale,  configuram-se  como  um  importante  instrumento  para  a  capilaridade  da  ideologia \nda empresa na sociedade, tornando a sua visão hegemônica e atuando diretamente na formação \nda subjetividade social. Além de contribuir para a construção de uma imagem bastante positiva da \nempresa,  o  investimento  em  setores  como  educação,  saúde,  cultura  e  meio  ambiente  oferece \ndiversas  possibilidades  de  exposição  de  dados  e  fatos  não  estritamente  financeiros  da  Vale,  e \nservem para a geração de valor social à empresa, influenciando o seu valor e papel no mercado. O \nlançamento  anual  do  seu  Relatório  de  Sustentabilidade  é  parte  dessa  estratégia  de  legitimação \nsocial.” \n\nEnglish version: “Through the Vale Foundation, Vale S.A. invests in numerous projects related to \neducation for infants, young people and adults, both for its workers and in the communities near its \noperations.  These   projects   are   part   of   the   company’s   strategy   to   seek   legitimacy,  both  among \nsociety  and  in  the  markets.  Mining  is  a  sector  recognized  for  its  major  social  and  environmental \nimpacts.  As  a  result,  programs  linked  to  the  social  responsibility  of  companies  are  designed  to \nminimize  the  effects  inherent  to  mining  activity.  However,   in   Vale’s   projects   one   may   note   the  \ndevelopment of palliative  measures  that  take  advantage  of  the  state’s  omissions in the localities in \nquestion. In other words, Vale claims for itself a role that belongs to the state. The Vale Foundation \nfunctions  through  public-private  social  partnerships,  which  as  the  company  itself  describes,  are \npacts  between  government,  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  to  promote  regional  development, \nenabling  the  company  to  benefit  from  tax  incentives.  What  is  not  evident  is  how  its  social \nresponsibility  activities  interfere  with  decision-making  processes  within  the  public  authorities.  A \ngood  example  of  this  is  Vale’s   partnerships   with   Municipal   Education   Secretariats  to  offer \nprofessional  development  courses  for  teachers,  directors  and  supervisors  at  schools  looking  for \ncontinuing professional training. These courses, organized and conducted by the Vale Foundation, \nare  an  important  instrument  to   deploy   the   company’s   ideology  in  society,  making  its  vision \nhegemonic  and  directly  affecting  the  formation  of  social  subjectivity.  Besides  contributing  to  the \nconstruction  of  a  very  positive  image  for  the  company,  investment  in  sectors  such  as  education, \nhealth,  culture  and  the  environment  offer  various  possibilities  to  expose  facts  and  figures  that  are \nnot strictly financial about Vale, and serve to generate social value for the company, influencing its \nmarket value and role. The annual launch of its Sustainability Report is part of this strategy of social \nlegitimation.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nThe   Vale   Foundation’s   education   area  carries  out  projects  in  the  regions  where  Vale  operates,  in \npartnership  with  the  local  public  authorities  and   NGO’s,  creating  shared  agendas  and  working  in \nalignment  with  public  guidelines  and  policies  in  the  educational  area.  Accordingly,  we  understand \nthat our programs are part of the set of efforts being made at the moment to improve education. Our \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

These  partnerships \nare  designed  to  form  an  inter-sector  alliance  that  results  in  the  construction  of  a  shared  work \nagenda with the following aims:  \n\n  Promote quality of life and human development; \n\n  Strengthen inter-sectoral interaction and public policies; \n\n  Expand democratic participation from an angle of citizenship inclusion; \n\n  Ensure the effectiveness of private sector social investments; \n\n  Uphold  collective  construction  and  the  role  of  citizens  as  both  beneficiaries  and  co-\n\nparticipants in the regional development process. \n\nThe  Vale  Foundation’s  Education  area runs continuing training projects for education professionals \nin  accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  public  education  policies.  Accordingly,  the  content  of  training \nprocesses  is  aligned  with  the  proposals  of  the  Education  Ministry  and  based  on  prevailing \nlegislation, especially the  Law on National  Education Guidelines and Foundations  (Law 9,394/96). \nOur  training  projects  are  executed  by  renowned  institutions  in  the  education  area,  such  as  public \nuniversities  and  NGOs,  and  based  on  academic  research  results.  The  teaching  materials  used  in \nthis  training  are  provided  digitally  on   the   Vale   Foundation’s   website,  in  order  to  ensure  the \ntransparency of the approach used and permit in-depth knowledge about the activities conducted. \n\nIn  2014,  we  trained  552  teachers  and  42  school  managers.  Also  this  year,  we  held  a  range  of \nmeetings  with   the   authors   of   children’s   books,  with  the  participation  of  over  2,000  teachers  and \n4,500 students. In these meetings over 1,800 cases containing over 18,000 books were provided to \n1st  to  3rd  year  elementary  school  classes.  In  addition,  the  Vale  Foundation  has  seven  Learning \nHouses,  integration  spaces  for  the  exchange  of  experience  and  access  to  different  educational \nactivities that are available to the whole community. \n\nWe also clarify that the Vale Foundation is a duly constituted non-profit institution that possesses a \nFederal  Public  Utility  Title,  meaning  that  it  is  exempt  from  taxes  on  its  revenues  inherent  to  its \nactivities, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, article 150, VI, c.

An example of this kind of investment by the company was \nthe  launch  of  the  Vale-Capes  Science  and  Sustainability  Awards,  created  through  a  partnership \nbetween the Brazilian Education Ministry’s  graduate  education  support  agency (Capes) and Vale. \n\nEstablished  during  the  Rio  +20  Conference,  this  scheme  distributes  prizes  for  PhD  and  MA \ndissertations associated with environmental and social topics. Vale’s  partnership  with  one  of  Brazil’s  \nleading public institutions in the field of knowledge production is a way for the company to validate \nits image as an important promoter of new technologies and practices for sustainable development, \ncloaking  its  action  as  one  of  the  main  players  responsible  for  serious  social  and  environmental \nconflicts, both in Brazil and other countries. Furthermore, this partnership harms scientific autonomy \nin the study of relations between the environment and society in Brazil, especially with regard to the \nmining sector.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nSince 2009, when it created its Technology and Innovation Department, Vale has been establishing \ndistinctive ways of interacting with the science and technology community. This movement is based \non   the   company’s   perception  that  its  frontiers  need  to  be  expanded  to  permit  broader  and  more \nstructured  dialogue  with  other  players.  By  expanding  its  frontiers  and  developing  closer \nrelationships with academic institutions, the company shows that it values institutional coordination \nand  the  pursuit  of  complementary  interests  and  ways  of  working.  This  stance  is  aligned  with  the \nprinciple of open innovation, through which divergent views give way to cooperation and institutional \ncoordination.  \n\nIn  line  with  this  model,  Vale  has  developed  several  initiatives  together  with  the  academic \ncommunity,  including  the  launches  of  public  contests  in  partnership  with  government  entities  to \npromote  scientific  knowledge.

The initiative \nwas implemented through a national public contest, in which any student who completed an MA or \nPhD  course  in  2001,  at  any  Brazilian  university,  could  take  part.  In  its  latest  edition  (2014),  127 \npapers  were  submitted  from  all  over  Brazil  (90  MA  and  37  PhD  dissertations),  up  from  110  the \nprevious year. The award-winning papers included studies about the use of solar energy and social \ntechnologies  to  combat  poverty,  both  from  states  that  do  not  have  Vale  operations.  Given  the \ninitiative’s  success, Capes will not only maintain the awards in the coming years, but also proposes \nto hold a seminar regarding the winning entries for the next edition. \n\nVale  believes  that  a  modern  and  developed  society  is  the  result  of  dialogue,  in  which  differences \nare  viewed  as  opportunities  and  solutions  are  constructed  through  institutional  cooperation. \nAccordingly, university-company relationships are an ideal solution. \n\n29) \n\nCOMEFC \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Em 2013, no Maranhão, 23 prefeituras decidiram se reunir para criar o \nConsórcio dos Municípios da Estrada de Ferro Carajás (Comefc).

Vale’s  activities  have  made  a \nsignificant contribution to GDP, allowing mining regions to improve their HDI over the last 70 years \nin  the  State  of  Minas  Gerais  and  over  the  last  30  years  in  the  North  of  Brazil.  There  is  no \nquestioning  that  mining  activities  in  Brazil  have  had  a  positive  impact  at  the  national  and  local \nlevels. Numerous studies conducted by different specialists offer evidence to this end. One of them \nwas conducted by Oxford Policy Management, ICMM and IBRAM and can be accessed  on  ICMM’s  \nwebsite:  http://www.icmm.com/document/5423.  Two  other  reports  about  the  positive  impacts  of \nmining  in  Brazil  worth  mentioning  are:  www.fjp.mg.gov.br/index.php/noticias-em-destaque/1974-\nfundacao-joao-pinheiro-divulga-o-pib-dos-municipios-de-minas-gerais; \nwww.mdic.gov.br/sitio/interna/interna.php?area=2&menu=208. \n\nIn Mozambique and other countries where it operates, Vale is committed to achieving similar results \nand contributing to local and national development.  \n\nAlthough there is significant progress, we recognize there is still room for improvement, and Vale is \ncommitted  to  continuously  advancing  its  sustainability  performance.  That  said,  it  is  important  to \nclarify that the  allegation  that  Vale’s  activities  have  had  negative impacts in Brazil, Mozambique are \nbased  on  two  reports  that  have  partial  and  misleading  information:  the  2012  Public  Eye  and  the \n2015 Unsustainability Report. \n\nWe worked on the clarification and rectification  of the main allegations made against  Vale  in  both \nReports.

Desde 2012 \nestá  em  andamento  uma  Ação  Civil  Pública  (ACP)  que  contesta  a  legalidade  do  processo  de \nlicenciamento das obras de duplicação da Estrada de Ferro Carajás (EFC). A ACP questiona ainda \no fato de que as obras vêm sendo analisadas e licenciadas de forma fragmentada e por meio de \num  procedimento  simplificado  e  expedito,  fato  que  inviabiliza  as  análises  dos  impactos \nsinergéticos,  acumulativos  e indiretos.

Since  2012 a  public civil lawsuit \nhas  been  underway  that  contests  the  legality  of  the  licensing  process  for  the  work  to  expand  the \nCarajás  Railroad  (EFC).  The  public  civil  lawsuit  also  questions  the  fact  that  the  construction  work \nhas been analyzed and licensed in a fragmented manner and through a simplified, fast procedure, \nmaking  it  impossible  to  analyze  synergistic,  cumulative  and  indirect  impacts.  Vale  proposed,  and \nthe  Brazilian  environmental  regulator  (Ibama)  approved,  simplifying  the  licensing  process,  thereby \nexempting the company from the need for an environmental impact assessment (EIA-RIMA), public \nhearings  and  a  consultation  regarding  inquiries  about  the  prior,  free  and  informed  consent  of \nimpacted traditional communities.

The  entities  that  filed \nthe public civil lawsuit appealed this decision and the appeal should be heard soon by the Superior \nCourt of Justice, which may order the construction work to be halted once more.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nVale clarifies that the environmental licensing of the Carajás Railroad (EFC)’s  expansion was based \non the legal standards of the federal, state and municipal spheres. All the social and environmental \nstudies, plans and programs developed to mitigate the impacts caused by the work were properly \nsubmitted  and  compiled  in  the  Basic  Environmental  Plan  (PBA).  With  regard  to  indigenous  and \nquilombola \nspecific \nrecommendations  have  been  developed  for  each  affected  community.  All  these  steps  had  the \nparticipation  of \nintense  process  engagement  and \nconsultation,  offering  access  to  information  about  the  enterprise  before  the  implementation  had \nbegun,  discussing  their  worries  and  demands  and  working  on  short  and  long  term  mitigation \nprograms  \n\nindigenous  communities,  reflecting  an \n\nimpact  matrices \n\nanthropological \n\ncommunities, \n\ndiagnoses, \n\nand \n\nVale  acted  in  line  with  legal  provisions,  holding  a  public  and  transparent  process,  with  special \nconcern  for  technical  studies  regarding  indigenous  peoples  and  quilombola  communities,  and \nextensive  dialogue  with  them.  Communication  with  communities  near  the  railroad  is  permanent. \nPublic meetings were held with the affected communities on July 9, 10, 12 and 13, 2012, in addition \nto  meetings  dedicated  exclusively  to  quilombola  and  indigenous  communities.  These  public \nmeetings and hearings complied with the terms of CONAMA Resolution 09/86, which provides for \nprocedures for public participation within the scope of environmental licensing.  \n\nDue  to  the  regularity  of  the  studies  and  the  entire  public  consultation  process,  Vale  obtained  the \nrespective environmental licenses to install the project, and obtained approval from FUNAI and the \nPalmares Foundation to expand the railroad.  \n\nConcerning  the  Free,  Prior,  and  Informed  Consent  procedure  for  indigenous  and  traditional \npopulations, although Brazil abides by ILO Convention 169, through Legislative  Decree 143/2002, \nthe regulations stipulating procedures and the scope of rules is still under discussions.. Regardless \nof  this,  the  constant  and  transparent  dialogue  established  between  Vale  and  the  traditional \ncommunities  along  the  EFC,  as  well  as  the  provision  of  all  necessary  information  related  to  the \nproject  previous  of  its  implementation  to  these  communities,  in-person,  and  the  consultation  on \nwhich  and  how  the  mitigations  plans  should  be  developed  and  implemented  meet  the  essential \nobjective of ILO Convention 169. \n\nThe regularity of the environmental licensing process was reaffirmed in a court ruling of the Federal \nRegional Court (TRF), which recognized that the measures taken by Vale are in full compliance with \nthe requirements of the competent technical and environmental authorities. Note that the work does \nnot  involve  building  a  new  railroad  or  double-tracking  the  entire  length  of  the  existing  one,  but \nmerely  connecting  existing  railroad  yards  along  the  original  track,  which  will  generate  benefits  for \ngeneral  cargo  and  passenger  transportation,  besides  the  iron  ore.  Accordingly,  Vale  has  been \ninvesting  heavily  in  local  manpower  training  and  social  and  environmental  programs  to  boost  the \nlocal development of the region and its population. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Não  há  mineração  sem  desastre. \nNo  Pará  e  no  Maranhão,  meninos  e  meninas,  a  maioria  oriundos  dos  municípios  de  Marabá  e \nParauapebas, arriscam suas vidas viajando clandestinamente nos trens de carga ou nos trens de \npassageiros  da  Vale.

Em  seu \npercurso da mina ao porto, os trens da Vale atravessam mais de cem comunidades tradicionais e \nindígenas, dentre outros grupos sociais.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “Train  hopping  children.  There  is  no  mining  without  disaster.  In  Pará  and \nMaranhão,  boys  and  girls,  mostly  from  the  municipalities  of  Marabá  and  Parauapebas,  risk  their \nlives  by  traveling  clandestinely   on   Vale’s   freight   or   passenger   trains.  In  search  of  a  better  life  or \nescaping from their families, they try to reach São Luís in a state of extreme vulnerability, danger to \ntheir lives and utter lack of dignity. These children and teenagers hide among the iron ore, with only \ntheir  heads  appearing,  or  using  the  upper  part  of  a  soft  drink  bottle  as  a  funnel  through  which  to \nbreathe. Climbing into the iron ore railcars while the train is moving is extremely dangerous, leading \nin many cases to injury or mutilation. Cases of physical violence and threats against the children by \nVale’s   security   guards   have   also   been   reported.  Operating  for  three  decades  in  the  region,  Vale \ndoes not admit that this is an impact caused by mining and claims it is a consequence of existing \nsocioeconomic  problems.  In  their  journey  from  mine  to  port,  Vale’s   trains   cross   more   than   100  \ntraditional and indigenous communities, among other social groups.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nThe  phenomenon  known  as  the  “train  hopping  children”  consists  of  the  practice  of  children  and \nteenagers  covertly  entering  the  railcars  of  the  Carajás  Railroad  (EFC),  on  journeys  from \nParauapebas in Pará to São Luis in Maranhão, or vice versa. \n\nThe  EFC  extends  for  892  km  and  crosses  27  municipalities  (four  in  Pará  and  23  in  Maranhão), \npassing around 100 communities.  \n\nThe  Maranhão  State  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  filed  a  public  civil  lawsuit  in  2011,  and  in  the \nfollowing year a partial agreement was made to produce a Safety Plan to be implemented following \nanalysis and discussion between the parties. \n\nOn  March  16,  2012,  the  Maranhão  State  Public  Prosecution  Ministry,  together  with  several  public \nauthorities, deputies, representatives of public defender offices, the Pará State Public Prosecution \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

This  professional’s  fees  were  paid  by  the  company.   \n\nAt the invitation of the Pará State Public Prosecution Ministry, Vale attended the public hearing held \non  February  25  2015  in  Marabá,  where  it  presented  to  the  Ministry  and  other  stakeholders  the \nsafety study produced by the company and watched the presentation of the study conducted by a \nconsultant working for the Maranhão State Public Prosecution Ministry. \n\nTrain hopping by children and teenagers on freight trains is a social phenomenon, which according \nto research and studies arises mainly out of vulnerable situations in the municipalities of origin.  \n\nIn  line  with this situation,  in 2015  the Maranhão State Public  Prosecution Ministry, the  Pará  State \nPublic Prosecution Ministry and Vale signed an agreement to implement measures to eliminate or \nmitigate  clandestine  access  by  children  and  teenagers  to  freight  trains,  and  for  the  Public \nProsecution  Ministries  to take steps to ensure that  child  welfare councils, municipalities and  other \nentities meet their obligations, as part of a collective, multi-sector process to guarantee an effective \nsocial welfare policy that protects the rights of children and adolescents. \n\n5)  Silting of water sources, cracks, vibrations, pedestrian collisions and removals related to \n\nthe EFC  \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Ao  longo  da  Estrada  de  Ferro  Carajás  as  comunidades  sofrem  com  o  \nassoreamento de suas fontes hídricas, rachaduras nas estruturas de suas casas, atropelamentos \nde pessoas e animais, violação do direito de ir e vir das comunidades e remoções.” \n\nContudo,  apesar  de registrar as mortes de trabalhadores por acidentes do trabalho, a  Vale ainda \nnão divulga no seu relatório as mortes por atropelamento em suas ferrovias. \n\nEnglish version: “Along  the  Carajás  Railroad, communities suffer from the silting up of their water \nsources,  cracks  in  their  houses,  people  and  animals  being  run  over  by  trains,  the  violation  of \ncommunities’  right  to  come  and  go,  and  removals. \n\nHowever, despite recording the deaths of workers due to work accidents, Vale’s  report  still does not \ndisclose deaths due to people getting run over on its railroads.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nThe  Carajás  Railroad  (EFC)’s   safety   strip  is  designed  to  prevent  accidents  involving  railroad \noperations  in  areas  near  the  tracks.

Accordingly, \nperiodic inspections are carried out throughout the railroad to preserve the railroad safety strip.  \n\nWith regard to records of cracks in houses resulting from the impacts of railroad transportation, Vale \nadopts  mechanisms  to  inspect  and  survey  these  houses.  In  the  case  of  railroad  crossings,  Vale \nconducts  periodic  inspections  to  regularize  or  remove  illegal  crossings.  To  regularize  them,  the \ncompany counts the number of vehicles that use them in order to identify the need for signage and \ncrossing adjustments, or to install a road bridge. \n\nOfficial  railroad  crossings  are  those  that  have  been  approved  and  recognized  by  Vale,  and  they \nreceive proper signage and maintenance. The Carajás Railroad has 126 official railroad crossings \nalong its 892-km length, with an average distance between crossings of around 7 km.  \n\nAccording  to  the  National  Association  of  Railroad  Transportation  Companies  (ANTF),  the  EFC  is \nnow  considered   one   of   Brazil’s   leading   railroads,  not  only  due  to  its  freight  volumes,  but  also \nbecause it uses cutting-edge technology in its operations, making it highly productive, efficient and \nsafe.  To  guarantee  maximum  operational  safety  and  high  productivity  for  its  customers,  the  EFC \ncontinuously  invests  in  maintaining  and  expanding  its  assets,  including  by  acquiring  locomotives \nand specialist railcars to transport a variety of goods. \n\nDespite presenting continual improvements in the internationally adopted indicator of accidents per \nmillion  train-km  (mTKm),  which  takes  into  account  accidents  in  line  with  the  number  of  trains  and \ndistance  travelled,  we  know  we  still  need  to  do  more.  We  run  a  series  of  initiatives  to  mitigate \nimpacts and have teams dedicated to managing, monitoring, tracking and responding to incidents. \n\nOur mitigation initiatives include educational and awareness-raising campaigns in communities near \nthe  railroad,  modernization  and  expansion  of  signaling  systems,  the  identification  of  critical \nstretches  in  terms  of  environmental  risks,  weather  monitoring,  and  expansion  of  the  number  of \nsimulators and train operation training courses.

There  were  no  significant  lasting \nimpacts to the environment or to local indigenous populations.  \n\nFollowing the spill, demonstrations ensued by some residents of local communities that resulted in \ndamages to Vale property and delays in resuming production.   \n\nThe  CCCE  has  been  mandated  by  customary  chiefs  to  take  a  leadership  role  in  the  mediation \nprocess  with  all  community  stakeholders  involved.  A  mediation  process  was  set  up  through  the \nsubsequent  months  and  more  than  60  meetings  occurred  with  a  variety  of  stakeholder  groups \n(communities’   representatives,   South   Province   authorities,   municipalities,   customary   Senate,  \nunions,  tribal  chiefs,  NGOs,  Government,  among  others).  These  wide  consultations  allowed  the \nlocal population to follow the implementation of corrective and preventive actions defined by experts \nfrom  the  South  Province  and  VNC.  The  result  of  that  process  was  to  restore  and  normalize  the \nrelationship between Vale and local communities.  \n\nSince  the  resumption  of  operations  at  VNC,  the  Community  Relations  team  has  intensified  its \ninteractions with local communities and held several meetings with local tribes to initiate structuring \nprojects  for  communities.

As  a  result,  it  was  seen  that  the \natmospheric  quality  standards  defined  by  the  National  Environment  Council  are  being  complied \nwith, and that the contribution of industries is only predominant at the Senac Hotel station, on Boi \nIsland.  At  the  Enseada  do  Suá  and  Carapina  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  of  the  same \nmagnitude as the contribution  called  “human  activities” (re-suspension of soils and streets, vehicles \nand  burned  objects).  At  the  other  stations,  the  industrial  contribution  is  not  predominant,  with  a \nshare varying from 10% to 25% of total contributions.  \n\nThe  available  study,  however,  did  not  consider  the  environmental  improvements  implemented  at \nTubarão  Complex  in  recent  years,  as  it  was  completed  before  the  measures  provided  for  in  the \nEnvironmental Commitment Agreement were taken. As a result, for Vale it is essential to carry out \nnew  studies  to  update  and  expand  the  data,  to  determine  the  share  of  different  sources  in  the \ncomposition  of  the  “black  dust”  in  each  region  of  Greater  Vitória and enable strategic management \nof  the  region’s  air  quality.  \n\nThe  company  is  participating  in  new  studies  in  partnership  with  the  State  Public  Prosecution \nMinistry and the State Environment and Water Resources Institute. \n\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the company invested R$700 million in environmental controls. As a result \nof  these  investments,  Vale’s  entire  production  system  at  Tubarão Complex, from the arrival of iron \nore  until  its  loading  onto  ships,  is  equipped  with  the  most  modern  environmental  control \ntechnologies.  \n\nThis investment includes the following: the installation of wind fences, pioneering structures in Brazil \nthat reduce the wind speed around piles of iron ore and pellets, cutting the amount of dust carried \ninto the air by 77%; the application of dust polymers and suppressants, products that prevent dust \nemissions  in  piles  of  iron  ore  and  pellets;  the  use  of  new  longer  chutes  on  ship  loaders  to  direct \nproducts  into  vessel  holds;  the  enclosure  of  areas  where  products  are  transferred  from  one \nconveyor belt to another; and the operation of 25 electrostatic precipitators, equipment that is 99% \nefficient in controlling emissions in smokestacks. \n\nTubarão  Complex  also  has  an  Environmental  Control  Center,  which  uses  a  CCTV  system \ncomposed  of  22  continuously  operating  cameras  to  monitor  Vale’s   operations,  in  order  to \npreventively  guarantee  the  effectiveness  of  environmental  controls.  This  enables  immediate \ndecision making, with agility and efficiency, in the event of operational deviations. \n\nVale reiterates its commitment to the environment and the communities of Greater Vitória. \n\nVale  is  fully  willing  to  collaborate  with  the  Parliamentary  Commission  of  Inquiry  about  black  dust \ninstigated by the Legislative Assembly of Espírito Santo in order to investigate particulate emissions \nand their effect on the health of Greater  Vitória’s  people, and it reiterates that it is always open to \ndialogue with society. \n\n8)  Death of two workers in Sudbury, Canada \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

As  famílias  vivem com \ndificuldade  de  acesso  à  água,  terra,  energia,  em  terras  impróprias  para  a  agricultura,  e  não \nreceberam, até o momento, as indenizações integrais a que têm direito. As casas, construídas pela \nprópria  Vale,  já  passaram  por  reformas  ao  menos  três  vezes  devido  às  rachaduras,  aos \nvazamentos e à erosão que abala a estrutura das casas. Vários protestos já foram realizados pelas \nfamílias  reassentadas,  alguns  com  o  bloqueio  das  estradas  que  dão  acesso  à  mina  da  Vale.  As \nfamílias denunciam as precárias condições de vida a que estão sujeitas desde o final de 2009 e até \no momento  não  houve  nenhuma  resposta  satisfatória  da  empresa.  “Nos  prometeram  dois  hectares  \nde  terra,  só  deram  um,  e  uma  terra  ruim  que  não  rende  nada”,  João  Salicuchepa  Gimo,  que  mora  \ncom a mulher e sete filhos no assentamento de Cateme.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “In  Mozambique,  Vale  is  known  for  the  terrible  conditions  in  which  it  resettled \nmore than 1,300 families, removed from their lands occupied for generations to  make way for the \ncompany’s  coal  mining  project  in  Tete province. The families live with difficult access to water, land \nand  energy,  on  land  unsuited to farming, and they have  not  yet received the full compensation  to \nwhich  they  are  entitled.  The  houses,  built  by  Vale  itself,  have  already  undergone  renovations  at \nleast  three  times  due  to  cracks,  leaks  and  structural  erosion.  The  resettled  families  have  held \nvarious protests, in some cases blocking  the  roads  that  provide  access  to  Vale’s  mine. The families \nhave complained about the poor living conditions to which they have been subjected since the end \nof 2009, and so far there has been no satisfactory response from the company.  ‘They  promised  us  \ntwo hectares of  land  but  they  only  gave  us  one,  and  it’s  poor  land  that  doesn’t  produce  anything,’  \nsaid João Salicuchepa Gimo, who lives with his wife and seven children in the Cateme settlement.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nDespite  presenting  significant  progress,  Mozambique  is  a  country  that  still  poses  challenging \nsocioeconomic  conditions  for  businesses.

Following \nprocedures and guidelines established by the company based  on respect for human rights and in \nline with international standards, this program began in 2006 and involved social dialogue with the \ngovernment  and  communities.  The  family  transfer  stage  was  completed  in  2010,  with  the \nresettlement of 1,365 families into two new settlements: Cateme, with rural characteristics; and 25 \nde Setembro, with urban characteristics. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Based  on the findings of this research  and  analysis  of national and international human \nrights  safeguards,  we  identified  practical  recommendations  of  greatest  relevance  to  potential \nresettlement  resulting  from  various  development  projects  that  may  occur  in  Mozambique  in  the \ncoming years. \n\nThe  fact  that  Human  Rights  Watch  based  its  research  on  concrete  data  and  its  problem-solving \nattitude made this engagement process a rich learning experience for Vale and highly beneficial for \nthe resettled families. \n\nIn its report, Human Rights Watch recognized  Vale’s  efforts  to solve the problems presented by the \nresettled people and stressed that Vale and the government of Mozambique signed a memorandum \nof understanding, and almost all of the actions in this agreement have now been implemented.  \n\nVale in Mozambique has been working continuously to improve the new settlements and is striving \nto take measures to support these families, together with the spheres of government and based on \ndialogue with these communities.  \n\nThe process of producing the Resettlement Action Plan involved extensive engagement and public \nparticipation, consisting of three public hearings, 20 theater performances in the predominant local \nlanguage  (Nyungwe),  110  meetings  with  the  community  and  its  leaders  using  tools  such  as \nillustrated materials, 4,927 home visits to families and leaders for mobilization and social assistance \npurposes, and 639 social consultations until the start of resettlement. \n\nAs  part  of  the  process  of  implementing  the  Moatize  Coal  project,  the  following  infrastructure  was \nbuilt  or  renovated  for  the  community  in  the  Cateme  and  25  de  Setembro  areas:  an  elementary \nschool,  library,  teachers’   houses,   school   principal’s  house,  high  school,  information  technology \nroom, laboratory, health and maternity center, police station, streets, and electric power facilities. \n\nIn the neighborhood of Cateme, for example, Vale built two schools within the scope of the national \neducation system. One of them is Cateme Elementary School, which can accommodate up to 1,200 \nstudents,  with  18  classrooms  and  a  library.  Cateme  High  School,  in  turn,  is  designed  for  up  to \naround  650  students  and  has  12  classrooms,  a  library,  accommodation  for  270  students,  and  an \ninformation technology room. \n\nOn July 6, 2012, Vale and the central government signed a memorandum of understanding in order \nto  establish  coordinated  actions  between  the  public  sphere,  the  company  and  community \nrepresentatives  to  maintain  the  existing  infrastructure  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the \ncommunities of Cateme and 25 de Setembro. \n\nThe  following  actions  have  been  carried  out:  maintenance  of  public  drains  and  streets, \nimprovements  to  the  water  supply  system,  expansion  of  the  power  grid,  construction  of  sports \nfacility,  investments  in  agriculture,  development  of  solutions  to  support  public  transport,  and \ninvestments in health, such as the delivery of the 25 de Setembro Health Center and donation of an \nambulance.  \n\nActions  are  being  developed  to  establish  alternative  income  generation  sources,  such  as  the \nfollowing: \n\n  Production  and  sale  of  chickens  to  increase   families’   income.  This  project  has  supported \n197 poultry farmers (109 women and 88 men) who are in full production, making a profit of \nUS$250 to US$350 per batch.  \n\n  Vegetable program,  which  is  designed  to  increase  families’  income  by  growing  and  selling \nvegetables  (tomatoes,  lettuces,  kale,  cabbages,  eggplants,  cucumbers,  peppers  and \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

So far, 61 kits drip-feed  irrigation  systems  have  been  installed  in  the  families’  yards \n(39 belonging to women and 22 to men). \n\n  Cash crop program, benefiting 176 families involved in growing sesame seeds and peanuts. \n\nThese families receive technical assistance from Vale.  \n\n  Home orchard program, aimed  at  increasing  families’  income  by  producing  and  selling  fruit,  \nwhile  encouraging  fruit  consumption  to  improve  the  community’s   diet.  This  program \nbenefited 57 families, by acquiring 2,892 fruit trees (including mango, guava and lemon). \n\n  Development of poultry and horticulture value chain in Cateme, through the installation of a \n\nslaughterhouse and vegetable packing house.  \n\n  Holding  of  vocational  training  courses  on  electricity,  IT  and  construction  for  150  young \n\npeople in Cateme.  \n\nIn  order  to  reinforce  community  dialogue  and  engagement,  and  promote  civic  and  citizenship \nactivities,  Vale  has set up  a number of  community centers. Among  other purposes, these centers \nare  designed  to  share  information,  interests  and  expectations,  build  mutual  trust,  improve \nknowledge of local reality and support the community in finding solutions to demands raised during \nmeetings between the company and residents. The community centers involve the collaboration of \ncommunity  agents,  who  are  members  of  the  community  hired  by  Vale  to  facilitate  community \ndialogue.  \n\nThe actions conducted by Vale in region include the following: \n\n \n\nImplementation of a community radio station: In partnership with the Social Communication \nInstitute,  Vale  has  established  a  community  radio  station  in  Cateme  to  produce  programs \naimed at community development. \n\n  Health: Construction of “Mothers’  Waiting  House,” a building designed to receive pregnant \nwomen  awaiting  birth.  The  Cateme  Health  Center,  which   includes   the   Mothers’   Waiting  \nHouse, serves communities located within a 20-km radius. \n\n  Road  building:  As  a  way  of  supporting  the  communities  and  improving  Cateme’s  \n\naccessibility, Vale built an 8-km paved road, including two bridges. \n\n  Expansion of power grid: In response to community requests, Vale funded the expansion of \n\nthe power grid, to cover all the new neighborhoods of Cateme. \n\n \n\nIncrease  in  water  storage  capacity:  Vale  has  built  two  dams  in  Cateme,  raising  the  water \nstorage  capacity  to  supply  crops  and  livestock.  It  has  also  distributed  drums  to  facilitate \nwater transportation, reducing the amount of time spent on this activity.  \n\n  Promotion  of  livestock  farming:  Vale  donated  150  cattle  to  50  families.  Each  family \nreceived three  animals  (two  oxen  to  be  used  as  draft  animals  and  one  cow  for \nreproduction).  The  company  also  donated  25  Brahman  bulls  to  improve  the  genetics  of \nlocal cattle. \n\n  Training  on  rural  finance:  Around  800  families  have  done  training  on  savings  and  credit, \nleadership,  management  and  business  development,  and  how  to  establish  and  run \nassociations. This training culminated in the formation of eight associations and two unions \nin  the  community  of  Cateme.  The  aim  of  this  training  was  to  ensure  food  security  by \npromoting entrepreneurial  capabilities and skills to create and manage small self-sufficient \nenterprises to generate income. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Na  área  de  carregamento  e  descarregamento,  há  uma  alta  concentração  de  poeira,  que \ncausa a perda da  vegetação na região e coloca em risco a saúde dos habitantes. A partir de um \nestudo  realizado,  o  Instituto  de  Estudos  Sociais  e  Econômicos  Moçambicano  (Iese)  alertou  que \nMoatize  poderá  enfrentar  graves  problemas  de  poluição  atmosférica,  devido  às minas  de  carvão, \nalém  de  constatar  que  a  presença  no  ar  de  poluentes,  como  o  dióxido  de  enxofre,  óxidos  de \nnitrogénio  e  monóxido  de  carbono,  poderá  ser  prejudicial  para  a  saúde  da  população  em  longo \nprazo.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “In  the  district  of  Moatize,  in  Tete  province,  Mozambique,  home  to  one  of  the \nworld’s   largest   coal   deposits,   Vale  S.A.  is  engaged  in  open-pit  coal  mining.  In  the  loading  and \nunloading area, there is a high concentration of dust, causing a loss of vegetation in the region and \nendangering  the  health  of  its  inhabitants.  A  study  carried  out  by  the  Mozambican  Social  and \nEconomic  Study  Institute  (Iese)  warned  that  Moatize  may  suffer  serious  atmospheric  pollution \nproblems due to its coal mines, and found that the presence in the air of pollutants such as sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide  may  be  harmful  to  the  population’s  long-term health.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nWith regard to air quality, we have a real-time monitoring network with stations located inside and \noutside the concession area, measuring emissions levels. To gauge possible emissions arising from \nthe concession area, in April 2015 we set up a station within the community (in the boundary with \nthe concession area). We follow air quality legal standards. We monitor SO2, NO2, O3, PTS, PM10 \nand PM2.5. These parameters record concentrations below the standards at our monitoring station \nlocated  between  the  mining  concession  and  the  community,  indicating  a  low  impact  of  mining \nactivity. On the other hand, the monitoring station located inside the town of Moatize presents high \nlevels of particulate matter, indicating the influence of other activities on these concentrations. The \nconcentrations recorded so far at the station in the boundary of the community and the concession \narea may be associated with the effectiveness of the environmental particulate control measures in \nplace at the mine, namely fixed sprinkler systems in the stockyard, mist cannons at the run of mine \n(ROM)  pad,  sprinkling  of  temporary  access  roads,  and  the  application  of  a  bitumen-based \nbiodegradable   emulsion   called   “Dust-a-Side”   on   permanent   access   roads   to   reduce   particulate  \nmatter emissions. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Negando, deste modo, sua própria negligência e os \nimpactos  da  intensificação  da  extração  mineral  na  saúde  do  trabalhador.  Para  piorar,  a  empresa \ncostuma culpabilizar as vítimas. \n\nNo processo de intensificação da jornada de trabalho, a Vale conseguiu anular a jornada de turno \nrodízio de seis horas. Este turno garante, minimamente, que, diante de um trabalho desgastante, \ndecorrente  do  revezamento  da  jornada  entre  os  períodos  diurno  e  noturno,  além  de  perigoso  e \ninsalubre  como  o  da  mineração,  os  trabalhadores  consigam  algum  tipo  de  bem-estar  e  tenham \ntempo  livre  fora  das  minas.  O  aumento  da  jornada  de  trabalho  para  oito  horas  resulta  em  mais \nacidentes,  mais  afastamentos  por  problemas  de  saúde  e  no  aumento  de  uma  doença  que  vem \nassolando os trabalhadores mineiros: a depressão.” \n\nEnglish version: “In  Canada,  Minas  Gerais  and  Parauapebas,   labor unions  denounce the under-\nreporting of work accidents, increase in length of working days, high amount of overtime demanded, \nincrease in pressure and  harassment within the company, co-opting of unions, and persecution of \nunion leaders. \n\nIts  2013  Sustainability  Report  mentions  some  accidents  that  occurred  within  its  operational  sites. \nHowever,  Vale  does  not  take  responsibility  for  these  accidents,  nor  for  the  seven  deaths  that \noccurred.  In  this  way,  it  denies  its  own  negligence  and  the  impacts  of  intensification  of  mineral \nextraction  on  workers’  health. To make things worse, the company continues to blame victims. \n\nAs part  of the  working  day intensification  process, Vale has managed to end the six-hour rotating \nshift working day. This system ensures that, given the stress involved in taking turns doing day and \nnight  shifts,  as  well  as  the  dangerous  and  unhealthy  nature  of mining  work,  workers  obtain  some \nkind of wellbeing and have free time away from the mines.

O  sindicato \nMetabase Inconfidentes, em Minas Gerais, por exemplo, acusa a Vale de engessar as ações dos \nsindicatos e criar empecilhos às tentativas de garantir melhores condições de vida e trabalho. Um \ndos mais recentes casos foi a perseguição a dirigentes, que culminou com a demissão do diretor \nsindical  Vander  Luis  Ferreira,  em  junho  de  2014,  sem  qualquer  justificativa  razoável.  Na  época, \nestavam  ocorrendo  várias  manifestações  de  trabalhadores  e  da  população  em  geral  que \nreivindicavam  condições  básicas  de  trabalho,  segurança,  saúde  e  transporte  nas  localidades  em \nque a Vale e outras mineradoras atuam. O diretor foi penalizado por ter ousado criticar a empresa \ndiante da imprensa. Este tem sido o padrão histórico de atuação da Vale, tanto no Brasil como no \nexterior.

Durante  essas  duas  décadas,  a \nempresa  e  o  próprio  movimento  sindical  cooptado  alegavam  a  inexistência  de  oposição  entre  os \ntrabalhadores, abafando a permissiva influência da empresa e a insatisfação dos trabalhadores.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “Contrary  to  Vale’s  claims,  workers  and  communities  report  a  non-existence  of \ndialogue,  intimidating  practices  and  a  permanent  policy  of  co-opting  the  labor  movement  and  its \nrepresentatives in order to control criticism. The Metabase Inconfidentes union in Minas Gerais, for \nexample,  accuses  Vale  of  stifling  the  actions  of  unions  and  creating  obstacles  to  attempts  to \nguarantee better living and working conditions. One of the most recent cases was the  persecution \nof leaders, which culminated in the dismissal of union director  Vander Luis Ferreira in June 2014, \nwithout  any  reasonable  grounds.  At  the  time,  various  protests  were  taking  place  among  workers \nand  the  general  public  to  demand  basic  working,  safety,  health  and  transport  conditions  in  the \nlocations  where  Vale  and  other  miners  operate.  The  director  was  penalized  for  having  dared  to \ncriticize the company in the press. This  has  been  Vale’s  standard conduct over time, both in Brazil \nand  abroad.  In  2008,  the  Petrochemical  Industry  Workers  Union  (Sindiquímica)  in  Paraná[8] \nsubmitted   a   complaint   about   Vale’s   anti-union  practices  to  the  International  Labor  Organization \n(ILO). \n\nAt  the  operation  in  Voisey’s Bay, Labrador, Canada, relations between Vale and the union were not \ncompletely repaired, and the legacy of the 18-month strike (2009-2011) remains. There are reports \nthat  following  the  end  of  the  strike,  Vale  continues  to  have  arbitrary  management  practices  in  the \nworkplace. Vale  continues  to  hinder  workers’  lives  by  pursuing  agreements  in  cases of lawsuits and \narbitration. The  company’s  management  style  is  often  interpreted as a strategy to subtly undermine \nunions’  power  and  isolate  democratically  elected union leaders. \n\nDisrespect for free association and co-opting of union. The Carajás Metabase Union in Pará is the \nlargest  mining  union  in  the  country,  and  because  it  is  located  at  the  heart  of  Vale’s  main  mine,  it  has  \na strategic role for the company. Vale’s  practice  of  co-opting the union came to light in 2014, when \nafter  20  years  a  group  of  workers  managed  to  register  a  team  of  candidates  to  compete  for  the \nunion’s  presidency  without  being  defeated  behind  the  scenes. Throughout these two decades, the \ncompany  and  the  co-opted  union  movement  itself  alleged  a  lack  of  opposition  among  workers, \nstifling  the  company’s  permissive  influence  and  workers’  dissatisfaction.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nVale rigorously complies with legislation and respects union freedom and collective bargaining. We \nenter into collective agreements with all the unions that represent our employees and the decisions \nof   workers’   assemblies   are  sovereign  and  fully  respected  by  the  company. We do  not  interfere  in \nany way in internal union processes and  unions’  legitimate  relations  with  workers. \n\nIn  line  with  our  code  of  ethics,  Vale  does  not  tolerate  any  kind  of  discrimination,  including  with \nregard to union membership. \n\nOur  collective  work  agreement  contains  a  clause  related  to  “Respecting   and   Valuing  Employees: \npreventing  bullying.”  This  important  item,  negotiated  with  all  unions  in  Brazil,  has  improved  our \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Cases such as those involving harassment of \nany kind,  including regarding  unions, may  be reported, and  they  will be  responded to  without any \ninterference from other parts of the company. \n\nWith regard to the dismissal of the mentioned union leader, the company announces that a process \nwas conducted to investigate a breach of internal regulations according to the Brazilian Law. \n\nThe  collective  agreement  also  contains  a  clause  to  allow  union  leaders  to  enter  company \noperations in order to carry out unionization campaigns. Unions have used this option and no union \nentities or employees have suffered any interference in doing so. \n\nOur health and safety systems are also discussed with the unions. Once every six months, we hold \na  workshop  attended  by  representatives  of  all  unions,  as  well  as  representatives  of  central  union \norganizations.  At  these  events,  the  company  presents  its  workplace  safety  systems  and  control \nmechanisms in a very transparent manner. Information about accidents, including their causes, and \nways of responding to and preventing them, is transparent and easy to interpret. Unions can have \naccess to this information whenever they consider this necessary. \n\n16)  Water: Apolo Project, São Luiz Mine, Samarco, and  Voisey’s Bay \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “A  mineração  compromete  não  apenas  o  uso,  mas  o  acúmulo  e  a \nrenovação  das  águas,  provocando  o  fim  das  nascentes.  Além  dos  impactos  ambientais,  há  um \naumento  crescente  do  uso  de  grandes  volumes  de  água  como  insumo  gratuito  pelas  grandes \nmineradoras, especialmente no que se refere aos minerodutos. \n\nA água é o principal insumo do setor da mineração, sendo utilizada no processamento e transporte \ndo minério. Os impactos desta atividade sobre as águas são extremamente graves, englobando a \ndestruição  de  lençóis  de  água  no  subsolo;  piora  na  qualidade  da  água  no  momento  de  sua \ndevolução, em relação à sua retirada; diminuição da sua disponibilidade; e contaminação de rios, \nmares  e  nascentes  com  rejeitos  químicos,  entre  outros.  Desse  modo,  a  mineração  compromete \nnão  apenas  o  uso,  mas  o  acúmulo  e  a  renovação  das  águas,  provocando  o  fim  das  nascentes. \nAlém  dos  impactos  ambientais,  há  um  aumento  crescente  do  uso  de  grandes  volumes  de  água \ncomo  insumo  gratuito  pelas  grandes  mineradoras,  especialmente  no  que  se  refere  aos \nminerodutos. Em apenas uma hora de funcionamento, eles utilizam água suficiente para abastecer \nao menos uma cidade com 500 mil habitantes no mesmo período de tempo. Em 2012, houve mais \noutorgas para o uso de água na mineração do que para a indústria no Brasil. \n\nNo  Canadá,  o  projeto  de  extração  de  níquel  Voisey’s  Bay, da Vale, é bastante polêmico devido à \ncontaminação  do  Lago  Sandy,  que  possui  um  ecossistema  único.  Utilizado  como  local  para \ndespejo de rejeitos, o lago foi convertido em uma bacia com mais de 400 mil toneladas de dejetos, \nde acordo com denúncias de organizações locais. Além da Vale ser ré na maior Ação Civil Pública \nda história do Canadá por  problemas ambientais, ela  foi condenada,  em 2010, ao pagamento  de \ncerca de C$ 36 milhões (dólares canadenses) em indenização para mais de sete mil moradores de \nPort Colborne, em Ontário.  \n\nEm  Minas  Gerais,  berço  da  criação  da  Vale,  são  inúmeros  os  casos  de  conflitos  entre  o  uso  da \nágua  para  as  operações  da  empresa  e  o  abastecimento  da  população.

A expansão desta \nmina  aconteceu  em  2007,  e  a  cava  foi  realizada  muito  perto  da  comunidade  e  da  fonte  de \nabastecimento do distrito. Os moradores já notam que algumas nascentes estão assoreadas e que \na vazão dos cursos  d’água  diminuiu  consideravelmente,  além  dos problemas decorrentes da poeira \nda  mina  e  da  poluição  do  ar  também  terem  se  agravado  muito.  Mesmo  assim,  a  Vale  planeja \nreabrir  a  mina  Tamanduá,  que  estava  fora  de  atividade  há  cerca  de  quinze  anos.  Esta  mina \nlocaliza-se ainda mais próxima da comunidade do Morro da Água Quente, e perigosamente perto \nda  fonte  de  água  que  abastece  a  sede  do  município  de  Catas  Altas.  Ou  seja,  as  duas  fontes  de \nabastecimento  da  cidade  estão  em  risco  devido  às  operações  da  Vale.  Trata-se  da  segurança \nhídrica de mais de cinco mil pessoas.  \n\nOutro  grave  conflito  de  uso  da  água  pela  Vale  se  encontra  no  modal  de  escoamento  dos \nminerodutos, onde a polpa do minério de ferro é bombeada através da água durante 24 horas por \ndia. A Samarco (empresa em que a Vale detém 50% das ações) opera três minerodutos em Minas \nGerais, que saem da mina Alegria, em Mariana, e vão até o porto do Ubu, em Anchieta, no Espírito \nSanto.  Cada  um  deles  possui  mais  de  400  km  de  extensão.  Os  três  minerodutos  gastam  uma \nmédia de 4.400m³/hora. Depois de décadas destruindo os mananciais dos municípios de Mariana e \nOuro Preto, a empresa precisou captar água para os minerodutos e as usinas da Samarco no Rio \nConceição,  localizado  no  distrito  de  Brumal,  na  cidade  de  Santa  Bárbara.  A  adutora  construída \npara estes fins utiliza 82% do potencial hídrico do rio. Moradores da região informam que na época \nda estiagem o rio termina, literalmente, no ponto de  captação para o duto.  É importante ressaltar \nque, em 2010, um dos minerodutos da Samarco rompeu no município de Espera Feliz, causando \num grave desastre ambiental.” \n\nDestruição da Serra do Gandarela e de seus recursos hídricos \n\nHá  7  anos  o  Movimento  pela  Preservação  da  Serra  do  Gandarela,  do  qual  participam  diversas \norganizações e cidadãos de Minas Gerais e de todo o Brasil, atua no enfrentamento às pretensões \nminerárias  da  Vale.  A  Serra  do  Gandarela  abriga  a  última  grande  área  intacta  do  quadrilátero \nferrífero-aquífero e o mais importante aquífero e mananciais de água de alta qualidade da região, \nafluentes das bacias hidrográficas dos rios das Velhas (Bacia do Rio São Francisco) e Piracicaba \n(Bacia  do  Rio  Doce).  Por  esses  motivos,  a  sociedade  civil  organizada  solicitou  a  criação  de  um \nParque  Nacional  e  de  uma  Reserva  de  Desenvolvimento  Sustentável  (RDS).  Desconsiderando  a \nenorme  relevância  ambiental,  paisagística,  científica  e  cultural  da  região,  assim  como  o  amplo \ndebate  social  sobre  o  tema  e  sua  tramitação  no  âmbito  técnico  do  Instituto  Chico  Mendes  de \nConservação  da  Biodiversidade (ICMBio), o  Ministério do Meio Ambiente (MMA) encaminhou  e a \npresidente Dilma Rousseff criou, através de decreto em 13 de outubro de 2014, o Parque Nacional \nda  Serra  do  Gandarela[33],  sem  contemplar  em  sua  demarcação  as  áreas  que  reúnem  o  maior \nnúmero  de  atributos  que  justificam  a  criação  da  Unidade  de  Conservação  federal.  Assim, \ninestimável  patrimônio  socioambiental,  comprometendo \ncolocaram  sob  ameaça  esse \nirremediavelmente  mananciais  essenciais  para  as  cidades  vizinhas,  como  Caeté,  Nova  Lima, \nRaposos,  Rio  Acima,  Santa  Bárbara  e  Barão  de  Cocais,  além  da  última  reserva  estratégica  de \nágua para o abastecimento de Belo Horizonte e sua região metropolitana. Em um período em que \nhá graves ameaças ao abastecimento de água e conflitos de uso na própria região Sudeste, não \nfaz  nenhum  sentido  criar  um  Parque  Nacional  excluindo  de  seus  limites  áreas  de  extrema \nrelevância ambiental e  hídrica. Muito menos permitir nesta área  a exploração mineral pretendida, \nprincipalmente  pela  Vale  com  os  projetos  Apolo,  Piacó  e  Baú.  A  Vale  fez  gestões  para  reduzir  a \nárea  do  Parque  Nacional.  Desde  2007,  a  empresa  insiste  em  concretizar  seus  empreendimentos \nminerários  na  região  e,  para  isso,  já  foram  diversas  as  suas  tentativas  para  ter  a  Mina  Apolo \nlicenciada. Esta empresa, portanto, não respeita a relevância da Serra do Gandarela, nem sequer \nno sentido da garantia de água para milhões de pessoas.” \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts of water \nare used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. \n\nWater  is  the  mining   sector’s   main  input,  and  it  is  used  in  processing  and  transporting  ore.  The \nimpacts  of  this  activity  on  water  are  extremely  serious,  including  the  destruction  of  underground \nwater tables, deterioration of water quality when it is returned compared to when it was extracted, a \nreduction  in  its  availability,  and  contamination  of  rivers,  seas  and  springs  with  chemical  waste, \namong  other  things.  Thus,  mining  harms  not  just  the  use  of  water,  but  also  its  accumulation  and \nrenewal, causing an end to springs. Besides the environmental impacts, increasingly large amounts \nof water are used as a free input by large miners, especially in ore slurry pipelines. In just one hour \nof  operation,  these  pipelines  use  enough  water  to  supply  a  city  of  at  least  500,000  inhabitants \nduring  this  period.  In  2012,  there  were  more  permits  for  water  use  in  mining  than  in  industry  in \nBrazil. \n\nIn Canada, Vale’s  Voisey’s  Bay nickel mining project is very controversial due to the contamination \nof  Sandy  Pond,  which  had  a  unique  ecosystem.  Used  as  a  dumping  ground  for  waste,  the  pond \nwas  converted  into  a  basin  containing  more  than  400,000  metric  tons  of  waste,  according  to \ncomplaints from local organizations. As well as  Vale being the defendant in the largest public civil \nlawsuit  in   Canada’s   history   for   environmental  problems,  in  2010  it  was  sentenced  to  pay  around \nC$36 million (Canadian dollars) as compensation to more than 7,000 residents of Port Colborne in \nOntario.  \n\nIn Minas Gerais, Vale’s  birthplace,  there are numerous cases of conflicts between the use of water \nfor the company’s  operations  and  to  supply  the  population. In the municipality of Catas Altas, Vale \nextracts  iron  ore  from  São  Luiz  Mine  in  the  district  of  Morro  da  Água  Quente.  This  mine  was \nexpanded  in  2007,  and  mining  has  since  taken  place  very  near  the  community   and   the   district’s  \nwater  supply  source.  Residents  have  noted  that  some  springs  are  silting  up  and  that  the  flow  of \nwatercourses has reduced considerably. In addition, problems arising  from  the  mine’s  dust  and  air  \npollution have also become much worse. Despite this, Vale plans to reopen Tamanduá Mine, which \nwas  inactive  for  around  15  years.  This mine  is  located  even  closer  to  the  community  of  Morro  da \nÁgua  Quente,  and  dangerously  near  the  water  source  that  supplies  the  main  town  in  the \nmunicipality of Catas Altas. In  other  words,  the  town’s  two  water  sources  are  jeopardized  by  Vale’s  \noperations. The water security of more than 5,000 people is at stake. \n\nAnother serious conflict  regarding  Vale’s  water  use  is  found  in  its ore slurry pipelines, in which iron \nore slurry is pumped using water for 24 hours a day. Samarco (a company in which Vale has a 50% \nstake) operates three ore slurry pipelines in Minas Gerais, from Alegria Mine in Mariana to the Port \nof  Ubu  in  Anchieta,  Espírito  Santo.  Each  of  these  pipelines  is  more  than  400  km  long.  The  three \npipelines consume an average of  4,400 m³ of water per hour. After decades destroying springs in \nthe municipalities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, the company needed to extract water for  Samarco’s \nore  slurry  pipelines  and  plants  from  the  Conceição  River,  located  in  the  district  of  Brumal,  in  the \nmunicipality  of  Santa  Bárbara.  The  water pipe built for this  purpose uses  82%  of  the  river’s   water \npotential. Residents of the region say that in the dry season, the river literally dries up completely at \nthe   water   pipe’s   inflow   point.  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  2010,  one  of  Samarco’s   ore   slurry  \npipelines burst in the municipality of Espera Feliz, causing a major environmental disaster. \n\nDestruction of Gandarela Hills and their water resources \n\nFor  seven  years,  the  Movement  to  Preserve  the  Gandarela  Hills,  featuring  the  involvement  of \nvarious organizations and citizens from Minas Gerais and across Brazil, has been fighting against \nVale’s  mining  plans. The Gandarela Hills are home to the last large intact area of the ‘iron-aquifer \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

For these reasons, organized civil  society requested the creation  of a National  Park \nand  a  Sustainable  Development  Reserve.  Disregarding   the   region’s   enormous   environmental, \nlandscape, scientific and cultural relevance, as well as extensive social debate about the topic and \nits processing within the technical scope of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation \n(ICMBio),  the  Environment  Ministry  submitted  plans  for,  and  President  Dilma  Rousseff  created, \nthrough  a  decree  on  October  13,  2014,  the  Gandarela  Hills  National  Park[33],  without  including \nwithin its boundaries the areas with the largest number of attributes that justified the creation of the \nfederal Conservation Unit. Thus, they endangered this priceless social and environmental heritage, \nirreparably  harming  essential  water  sources  for  neighboring  municipalities,  such  as  Caeté,  Nova \nLima, Raposos, Rio Acima, Santa Bárbara and Barão de Cocais, as well as the last strategic water \nreserve to supply Belo Horizonte and its metropolitan region. At a time when there are serious water \nsupply   threats   and   usage   conflicts   in   Brazil’s   Southeast   region,  it  does  not  make  any  sense  to \ncreate  a  National  Park  whose  boundaries  exclude  areas  of  extreme  environmental  and  water \nresource  relevance.  It  makes  even  less  sense  to  permit  mining  exploration  there,  especially  that \nplanned  by  Vale  through  its  Apolo,  Piacó  and  Baú  projects.  Vale  made  efforts  to  reduce  the \nNational   Park’s   area.  Since  2007,  the  company  has  been  insisting  on  implementing  its  mining \nprojects in the region, and to this end it has made various attempts to get Apolo Mine licensed. This \ncompany, therefore, does not respect the importance of the Gandarela Hills, not even to guarantee \nwater for millions of people.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nApolo Project \n\nVale  began  studies  for  the  Apolo  Project  around  2006,  conducting  hydrogeological  studies  that \nsupported  the  respective  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  in  its  diagnosis  and  prognosis  of  the \nproject’s   impacts   on   the   region’s   water   resources.  The  results  of  these  studies  indicate  that  the \nApolo Project will not harm the water supply of Belo Horizonte and adjacent cities, and any impacts \nwill  be  duly  mitigated  in  line  with  prevailing  environmental  legislation  and  demands  by  the \nenvironmental licensing authority. \n\nThe Apolo Project’s  area  is  home  to  the water supply sources for the cities of Barão de Cocais and \nCaeté,  and  part  of  the  city  of  Belo  Horizonte.  The  main  allegation  against  the  project  among \norganized civil society is that there are several springs in its area of influence and that this is likely \nto affect the water supply of part of the local population. \n\nAlso regarding water supply issues, considering the study to evaluate water availability in the basins \nof the upper stretches of the Velhas and Paraopeba rivers, which are home to springs that feed the \nmetropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, COPASA’s  water  extraction  facility  from  the Velhas River is \nlocated around 7 km upstream from where it is joined by the Prata Stream, which is the watercourse \ninfluenced by the Apolo Project’s  implementation  area. \n\nTherefore, we  clarify  that  the  project’s  area  of  influence  is  not  related  to  the  water  extraction  points  \nused for the water supply in question. In addition, all water withdrawal points that currently supply \nthe metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte are located in areas of influence of mining projects, but no \nimpacts by these projects  on  water stocks allocated for public supply  have  ever been detected or \nforecast.  We  also  stress  that  in  our  environmental  controls,  we  have  also  created  an  extensive \nnetwork to monitor indicators, such as the quality and flow of watercourses. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Since then, the project has not moved forward. It is currently suspended. \n\nIt is important to note that Vale will only start implementing the Apolo Project once its environmental \nlicense has been duly approved, and in accordance with prevailing environmental legislation. \n\nCatas Altas \n\nIn 2010, Vale obtained an operating license to expand its activities at São Luiz Mine. \n\nVale clarifies that its activities do not interfere with water extraction points used to supply the district \nof Morro da Água Quente  and Catas Altas, which are found upstream  from  the  mine’s  operations. \nThe company monitors the flow and quality of water in the watercourses located around the project. \nThe  results  of  this  monitoring  have  been  in  accordance  with  the  parameters  determined  by \nlegislation. \n\nWith regard to particulate matter emissions, the company takes measures to control dust and it has \nan  air  quality  monitoring  network  to  measure  particulate  levels  in  the  area  around  the  operation. \nThe monitoring results have been within the limits determined by legislation. \n\nAll this monitoring work is officially registered with the environmental authority, in accordance with \nthe  operating  license’s  conditions. \n\nSamarco \n\n The   water   resource   management   is   a   fundamental   issue   on   Samarco’s   operations   and   plans.  \nSeveral  studies  and  project  have  being  developed  in  order  to  adopt  more  sustainable  practices. \nThis  work  is  oriented  by  the  aims  of  optimize  and  rationalize  the  water  use,  reduce  the  need  of \nmake-up  water,  increase  recirculation  water  rate  and  ensure  the  water  quality  discarded  to \nenvironment. \n\nIt’s   important   to   highlight   that   Samarco   does   not   withdraw   water   specifically   to   feed   the   pipelines.  \nThe water to the transport came from iron ore processing withdraw. So, regardless the pipeline, the \nwithdraw water is necessary due the industrial process nature. Part of water is treated and returns \nto water bodies close to company with quality level according the law requirements. About 90% of \nwater demanded by Samarco is recycled and the part used on pipeline is separated and used again \nin the pelletizing process in Espírito Santo. Those initiatives avoid, in large scale, the need of new \nwithdraw out of the environment. Nowadays Samarco uses 1632m3/h of water to transport ore pulp \nand not 4400m3/h as described. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The information about the use of 82% of the \nriver  capacity  is  unfounded.  According  to  the  IGAM  Ordinance  nº49/2010,  article  5º,  §1º,   “The \nmaximum limit of consumption withdraws to be permitted in the portion of water basing limited for a \nconsidered section, in natural conditions, will be 30% of Q7,10 (minimum flow rate in 7 (seven) days \nand  10  (ten)  years  of  recurrence)  being  assured  downstream  of  the  withdraw  minimum  residual \nflows  equal  of  70%  of  the  Q7,10”.  So,  the  water  used  by  Samarco  doesn’t  restrict others withdraws \nin  different  points  of  Santa  Bárbara  river.  As  established  by  the  law  above    on  that  specific  point \nwould be  allowed  withdraw of 3467m3/h and Samarco is allowed to  withdraw up to 2050m3/h, as \nthe flow rate defined by the permit – “Portaria  de  Outorga  Nº01323/2001”.   \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  in  2012  was  published  the  Resolution  SEMAD-IGAM  nº1548,  March \n29th, 2012 changing the permitted withdraw flow rate to 50% of Q7,10. On this conditions would be \nallowed to withdraw 5778m3/h on that point of Santa Bárbara river. \n\nThe  Federal  law  13199/99  (National  law  of  waters)  item  I,  Art.  3º  established  “the  right  of  access  of  \nall   to   water   resources,   priority   to   public   supply   and   ecosystem   maintenance”.   So   the   Samarco’s  \nwithdraws do not compete with human supply. In 38 years of pipelines operation there is no records \nof conflicts for water use in the neighborhood of company operations. \n\nRelated to the pipeline leaking in 2010 it should be noticed this is a localized occurrence identified \nand treated by the company with agility and transparency. \n\nSamarco,  immediately  after  the  identification  of  the  occurrence  informed  and  involved  the \ncompetent  authorities  and  took  care  of  all  work  to  rehabilitate  the  area.  The  action  was  properly \nfollowed  by  the  competent  authority  and  received  the  municipality  formal  recognition  for  the \ncompany responsibility and especially for the way of conduction the actions related to the fact. \n\nVoyces Bay \n\nVale is committed to long term sustainable development  – Vale’s  approach to sustainability entails \nbalancing environmental, social and economic factors from a macro perspective to achieve a result \nthat prioritizes the greater good and the best interests of the communities in which it operates.  The \noutcomes  of  the  Sandy  Pond  and   Port   Colborne   legal   matters   demonstrate   Vale’s   respect   for   the  \nenvironment and record of compliance with prevailing laws and regulations.  \n\nSandy Pond  \n\nThe  “Sandy  Pond  Alliance  for  the  Protection  of  Canadian  Waters”  filed an Application in the Federal \nCourt of Canada in June 2010  asking that  the  Metal  Mining Effluent  Regulations (\"MMER\")  under \nthe Fisheries Act, which permit the use of a lake or pond as a Tailings Impoundment Area (\"TIA\"), \nbe  declared  void  and  unlawful.  The  Application  does  not  seek  a  specific  remedy  or  order  against \nVale  but  rather  named  the  Government  of  Canada  and  challenged  the  Government  decision  to \nenact certain MMER provisions. The Sandy Pond Alliance position was that the Fisheries Minister \nand the Cabinet were not authorized under the Fisheries Act to enact regulations which permit the \nuse  of  a  fish  habitat  (i.e.,  a  lake  or  pond)  for  tailings,  the  result  of  which  is  the  destruction  of \nfreshwater aquatic life in the habitat. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The status of this matter is that the Sandy Pond Alliance \napplication was rejected by the Court without impact to Vale.   \n\nThe  Sandy  Pond  site  emerged  as  the  clear  and  most  responsible  selection  after  detailed \nexamination and comparison of several possible sites for the RSF.  A requirement related to the use \nof  Sandy  Pond  is  the  protection  of  fish  and  fish  habitat  under  the  Fisheries  Act  of  Canada.  The \nDepartment  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans   (DFO)   operates   on   the   “No   Net   Loss”   principle:   any   loss   of  \nproductive  fish  habitat  has  to  be  offset  in  an  acceptable  manner  so  that  there  is  no  net  loss  in \ncapacity.  Fish  habitat  can  be  altered  only  if  authorized  by  the  Minister  of  Fisheries.  Such \nauthorization  is  granted  only  if  an  acceptable  Fish  Habitat  Compensation  Plan  is  in  place  and  a \nbinding agreement is reached on its implementation. \n\nVale has legally relocated the freshwater aquatic life from Sandy Pond and continues to responsibly \nuse  Sandy  Pond   as   a   residue   storage   site   for   Vale’s   Long   Harbour   processing   plant   operations.    \nThis  is  all  in  accordance  with  prevailing  laws  and  regulations.    The  Sandy  Pond  residue  storage \nfacility (RSF) is one of 19 authorized impoundment areas in Canada. \n\nPCR Class Action Lawsuit \n\nA  class  action  lawsuit  in  Ontario  court  alleged  that  historic  emissions   from   Vale’s   Port   Colborne  \nrefinery had resulted in elevated nickel levels in the soil  and adversely affected property values of \nneighboring properties.  Vale acknowledged that there is nickel in the soil and that the majority of it \ncame  from  the  historical  (pre-1960)  operation  of  the  nickel  refinery  in  Port  Colborne.  Vale  put \nforward the position that the refinery was at all times operated in compliance with the environmental \nregulation  of  the  day  and  that  the  level  of  nickel  in  soil  was  below  the  standards  set  to  protect \nhuman health.  \n\nAt trial, the judge awarded damages to the Class Action plaintiffs in the amount of CDN$36 million \nplus  legal  costs.  This  decision  was  subsequently  reversed  by  the  Ontario  Court  of  Appeal, \naccepting  all  of  Vale’s  positions.  Thus  no  payment  by  Vale  to the Plaintiffs was required.  \n\nVale  recognizes  the  historical  soil  contamination  and  has  worked  to  undertake  Risk  Assessments \n(RAs),  as  required  by  the  Ontario  Ministry  of  the  Environment  (MOE).  The  RAs  evaluated  human \nhealth risk, ecological risk and risk to agricultural crops.  The studies provided further evidence that \nthe level of soil contamination does not represent a health risk to the  community.  The  MOE’s  review  \nof  Vale’s  RAs  is  ongoing.  Vale  continues  to  implement  its  risk  management  plan  to  address  areas  \nwith higher nickel soil contamination. \n\n17)  Xikrin: compensation programs \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “No  Pará,  o  povo  Xikrin  realizou  diversos  protestos  em  2014.

During  one  of \nthem, the  entrance  to  Vale’s  Onça Puma project in the Ourilândia do Norte region was blocked and \nproduction  halted.  The  indigenous  people  allege  that  nickel  mining  is  causing  extensive  harm  to \npeople’s   health   and   affecting   the   Cateté  River,  which  serves  the  community.  According  to  the \nFederal Prosecution Ministry, despite the health impacts on the Xikrin people, Vale has not begun \nany  compensation  program  and  has  not  complied  with  any  of  the  established  conditions.  Another \nVale  project,  the  Salobo  copper  extraction  project,  is  also  causing  negative  consequence  for  this \nsame people, by affecting areas where they collect nuts. For this reason, Salobo is the object of a \npublic civil inquiry under way at the Federal Prosecutor’s  Office  in  Marabá, Pará.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nOnça Puma \n\nAll  the  stages  of  the  Onça  Puma  project  were  planned  so  as  to  prevent  and  safeguard  the \nindigenous  people  and  their  territories  from  any  negative  consequences  that  may  arise  from  its \nimplementation or during its operational phase.  \n\nVale  also  understands  that,  following  the  completion  of  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté  Ethno-Ecological \nStudies,  which  detailed  the  impacts  on  these  indigenous  areas  more  directly,  and  proposed \nmitigating  actions,  strategies  and  measures  for  them,  any  detailed  information  needed  for  the \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA-RIMA)  has  already  been  supplied.  Based  on  the  impacts \nidentified  in  this  study,  a  Basic  Environmental  Plan  featuring  appropriate  mitigation  programs  was \nproduced  with  the  indigenous  community  participation.  However,  the  indigenous  people  are  not \nallowing  the  programs  that  were  defined,  with  their  participation  and  decision,  to  be  implemented \nwithin their indigenous land. They want extra financial resources to be paid by the company for their \nconsumption needs. The mitigation plan is established to have the financial resources being applied \nin  environmental  conservation,  health,  safety  improvement,  land  securing  and  monitoring,  cultural \nstrengthening  and  productive  activities,  in  an  equitable  way.  They  are  not  supposed  to  pay  for \ncosting  and  acquisition  of  consumer  goods  that  have  no  correlation  with  the  impacts  and  often \ngenerate  new  negative  impacts  to  these  populations,  including  their  socio-cultural  aspects  and \nhealth.   The direct financial transfer is not either equitably distributed by them. Therefore, some get \nmore  resources  than  others,  generating  new  internal  ruptures.  The  simple  increase  of  resources \nposes more threat to these people. A strong long term sustainable plan with good governance and \nmanagement  is  needed.    Vale  has  been  conducting  all  the  activities  outside  the  indigenous  land \ndefined in the Basic Environmental Plan, including the following: (i) Monitoring of water quality in the \nXikrin do Cateté indigenous land (monitoring of concentrations of heavy metals that could affect the \nindigenous  people’s  health);;  and  (ii)  Actions  to  mitigate  the  silting of the Cateté River (proposal for \nstructures to control this silting). This monitoring work has shown no change in turbidity that could \ninfluence   the   water   body’s   visual   characteristics.   Regarding   heavy   metals,   the   anomalies   found  \n(higher  concentrations)  are  related  to  regional  and/or  local  geology,  including  hydro-chemical \nprocesses,  water-rock  interactions,  the  time  that  water  spends  in  the  aquifer,  and  speed  of \ninfiltration. \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  since  1982  Vale  has  provided  support  to  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté \nindigenous  people,  complementing  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  Brazilian  state,  providing \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The project is fully \nsituated inside the Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest, a conservation unit protected by the competent \nenvironmental  authority,  and  human  occupation  in  the  location  is  prohibited.  Due  to  the \nconsiderable distance between the project and the indigenous villages where the  Xikrin do Cateté \npeople  live,  as  well  as  the  strict  environmental  control  systems  inherent  to  the  project,  these \ncircumstances  allow  us  to  affirm  that  there  are  no  significant  impacts  on  the  physical,  biotic  and \nsocioeconomic  environment  affecting  the  indigenous  land.  Discussions  have  been  held  with  the \nXikrin do Cateté people since the start of the Salobo Project. Although  they  did  not  use  the  project’s  \narea  before  it  began,  their  use  of  this  area  has  since  been  facilitated,  thereby  expanding  their \noptions  for  collecting  nuts  –  a  traditional  activity  that  the  company  now  supports  annually  on  a \nvoluntary basis. \n\n18)  Mãe Maria Indigenous Land \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal  Portuguese  text:  “Em  2015,  o  MPF  pediu  à  Justiça  Federal  que  obrigue  a  mineradora \nVale a voltar imediatamente a dar apoio à saúde dos indígenas da Terra Indígena Mãe Maria, em \nBom Jesus do Tocantins, no sudeste do Pará.

The  three  villages  without  Agreements  in  place  are  receiving  urgent  and \nemergency services, as well as high-complexity or high-cost specialist  treatments,  reflecting  Vale’s  \ncommitment  to  respect  the  communities  it  interacts  with,  in  order  to  promote  the  development  of \nlasting  and  healthy  relations  with  the  Gavião  people.

No  entanto,  a  Biovale  é  denunciada  por  conflitos  territoriais,  desmatamento  e \ncontaminação  por  agrotóxicos  de  igarapés,  que  alimentam  inúmeros  rios  da  região.  Em  2014,  o \nInstituto  Evandro  Chagas  comprovou  a  contaminação  por  agrotóxico  em  plantações  de  dendê, \nregistradas em um relatório de perícia feita nos municípios de São Domingos do Capim, Concórdia \ndo  Pará, Bujaru  e  Acará.

However,  Biovale  has  been  denounced  for \nterritorial  conflicts,  deforestation  and  pesticide  contamination  of  streams   feeding   the   region’s  \nnumerous rivers. In 2014, The Evandro Chagas Institute found pesticide contamination in palm tree \nplantations, as recorded in a report by a specialist produced in the municipalities of São Domingos \ndo  Capim,  Concórdia  do  Pará,  Bujaru  and  Acará.  Furthermore,  since  2008  members  of  a \nquilombola community in Concórdia, Pará, have accused the company of pressuring farmers to sell \ntheir  lands,  threatening  them  with  expropriation,  and  Tembé  indigenous  people  in  the  Turé-\nMariquita  territory   have   complained   about   the   impacts   of   the   company’s   activities   on   their   lands, \nthrough  pesticide  contamination.  In  2014,  these  indigenous  people  seized  eight  cars  and  tractors \nbelonging  to  Biopalma  in  protest.  In  other  words,  behind  the  image  of  a  company  that  is \nsustainable, responsible and concerned about future generations, there lies the same old practice \nof usurping and neglecting territories and communities. With regard to food prices, notwithstanding \nfactors  such  as  seasonal  situations,  crop  failures  and  sales  obstacles,  the  technical  supervisor  of \nthe Pará Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese), Roberto Sena, \nbelieves there is a relationship between the advance of palm trees and the rise in food prices.The \nproblem of family farming is the lack of a production policy; people have stopped growing cassava \nin  favor  of  palm  trees,’  he  says.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nBiopalma operates strictly according to labor and environmental legislation, and it clarifies that it has \nhad access to the “Technical report to evaluate surface water and bottom sediment located in areas \npotentially  impacted  by  palm  oil  tree  cultivation  in  the  municipalities  of  Concórdia  do  Pará  and \nBujaru,” produced by the Evandro Chagas Institute. This document does not contain any evidence \nof  pesticide-contaminated  surface  water,  and  its  analyses  of  sediments  detected  residues  of  DDT \nand Endossulfan – products that are not used by Biopalma. \n\nThe  company  emphasizes  that  it  does  not  have  any  activities  inside  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion.  Despite  this,  it  carries  out  sustainable  projects  to  support  the  indigenous  community, \nfocused  on  education,  health, \nfood  security,  basic  sanitation,  maintenance,  and  access \ninfrastructure.  For  example,  the  company  has  equipped  a  health  center  and  installed  micro  water \nsupply  facilities,  among  other  things,  all  in  accordance  with  the  ethno-environmental  report \nproduced in 2011 and updated in August 2012, and under Funai’s  supervision. \n\nIt should be noted that despite the actions taken by Biopalma to support the indigenous community \nof the Turé Mariquita territory, on December 24, 2014 indigenous person Lucinho Tembé began to \nlead  a  series  of  illegal  actions  against  the  company,  including  the  unlawful  seizure  of  vehicles, \ninterruptions of activities, threats to company employees, and theft of objects and fuel. In exchange \nfor the seized goods, the indigenous people presented a series of demands, which included, among \nother materials items, a monthly transfer of cash unconnected to any actions. The goods were only \nrecovered by Biopalma following a court ruling by the judge of the Second Federal Court of Belém. \nWe  emphasize  that  there  is  no  proof  of  any  impacts  caused  by  Biopalma’s   activities   on   the  \nindigenous territory. In addition, the study conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute did not cover \nthe municipality of Tome Açu, where the indigenous community in question is located. \n\nThus,  the  Federal  Prosecution  Ministry  filed  Injunction  in  order  to  investigate  the  alleged \ncontamination  of  the  indigenous  territory.  Biopalma  was  summoned  and  it  presented  its  defense. \nFollowing the legal procedures, the lawsuit was dismissed  by the judge of the Ninth Federal Court \nof Belém. \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv. Graça Aranha, 26, 20° andar \n20030-900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brasil \nVale S.A. \n\n34 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEven  though  the  lawsuit  was  dismissed,  Biopalma    started  to  hold  meetings  with  the  indigenous \ncommunity  and  FUNAI  with  the  aim  at  reaching  an  agreement  to  ensure  good  relations  with  the \nparties  involved.  The  indigenous  leaders  have  presented  their  claims  and  Biopalma  is  evaluating \ntheir  pertinence in relation  to their areas of activity, namely  education, health, food security,  basic \nsanitation, maintenance, and access infrastructure. At the moment there are no direct conflicts.  \n\nRegarding the allegation of deforestation,  it should be noted that the  Biopalma project has a  zero \nrate of deforestation, as it is exclusively planting palm trees in areas already altered, in line with the \nobligations  arising  from  environmental  legislation  and  the  company’s   objectives  and  principles  to \nconserve the biodiversity and ecosystem around it. As a result, the company is maintaining natural \nareas  of  habitat,  thereby  contributing  to  environmental  balance  and  the  conservation  of  natural \nresources in the region. \n\nIn the last six (6) months, it was identified that the  company’s  areas  allocated for “Reserva Legal”  \nsites  (legally  mandated  minimum  areas  of  native  habitat)  and/or  considered  Permanent \nPreservation  areas  have  been  systematically  invaded  for  illegal  logging,  especially  in  the \nmunicipalities of Acará, Tomé Açú and Concórdia do Pará. \n\nIn order to reduce incidents of illegal logging, Biopalma filed crime reports at the police station in the \nmunicipality where each property in question is located, and made a request to the Pará Specialist \nEnvironmental Police Department (DEMA) to launch a police inquiry to put a definitive end to such \nactions,  which  harm  not  only  the  company,  but  society  as  a  whole.  Biopalma  has  also  reported \nthese cases to the environmental authorities.  As a result of the measures taken by  Biopalma, the \nCivil  Police  have  already  carried  out  two  operations  in  the  region,  culminating  in  the  seizure  of \nillegally extracted timber.  \n\nRegarding the aforementioned territorial conflicts, Biopalma states that at no time has it made any \nkind  of  threats  to  rural  farmers  located  in  the  region  to  sell  their  lands,  and  it  has  certainly  not \nundertaken  any  planting  work  and/or  acquired  properties  belonging  to  the  indigenous  territory  in \nquestion. As stated before, Biopalma has been planting in already degraded areas. \n\nWith  regard  to  the  conflict  with  the  quilombola  community,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  request  to \ndemarcate  the  Amarqualta  quilombola  territory  was  filed  in  2011,  after  Biopalma  acquired  the \nproperties.  As  soon  as  it  became  aware  of  the  request  for  quilombola  demarcation,  the  company \nsuspended the planting of palm trees in the contested area and began to monitor the demarcation \nprocess with the Pará Land Institute (ITERPA), the body responsible for the process of demarcating \nquilombola  territory.  Alongside  the  administrative  process  under  way  at  ITERPA,  the  State  Public \nProsecution Ministry instigated a public civil inquiry to investigate the claims made by the members \nof the quilombola community regarding the activities of palm tree-growing companies, particularly in \nterms of land conflicts involving an area that is awaiting land title. Because of these administrative \nprocesses, Biopalma has had several meetings with ITERPA, the quilombola communities and the \nState  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  to  resolve  the  situation  through  negotiation.  At  the  moment,  the \nvalidity  of  the  land  titles  for  overlapping  properties  claimed  by  Biopalma  and  ITERPA  is  being \nevaluated. \n\nLaunched  in  February  2010,  Biopalma’s   Family   Farming   Program  consists  of  a  partnership  to \nproduce  palm  oil  fruit  with  rural  farming  families  in  northeast  Pará.  The  farmers  are  funded  via \nBanco  da  Amazônia,  Banco  do  Brasil  and  Banco  do  Estado  do  Pará  (Banpará),  with  credit  lines \nsupplied  by  the  National  Program  to  Strengthen  Family  Farming  (PRONAF  –  ECO  DENDÊ),  a \nfederal  government  program  to  acquire  saplings,  maintain  plantations  and  grant  financial  support \nfor subsistence needs in the first three years after planting until the first crops are harvested. \n\nAround  650  families  are  partners  of  this  Biopalma  program,  dedicating  part  of  their  lands  to  palm \ntree  plantations  and  receiving  technical  assistance,  as  well  as  guaranteed  purchases  of  raw \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

Farmers  already  at  the  harvesting  stage,  i.e.  at  least  three \nyears  after  planting,  have  seen  a  significant  increase  in  their  purchasing  power,  which  is  also \nresulting in growth in the acquisition of goods and services in  the  program’s  areas of influence. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  to  strengthen  family  farming  among  the  producers  served  by  the  program, \nBiopalma  conducts  monitoring  and  provides  technical  support  needed  for  the  families  to  develop \ntheir agricultural production, given that they also grow other crops on the same property. \n\nOne  of  the  ways  used  to  encourage  families  to  plant  a  variety  of  crops  is  the  “Productivity  Trio,” a \nprogram  formalized  through  a  partnership  between  Biopalma  and  Embrapa  that  involves  a \ncombination of three components of a cassava production system and their application at the family \nproperties in question.  \n\nThe Productivity Trio has the capacity to  use the spaces between  the rows of palm trees to grow \ncassava  roots  without  harming  the  perfect  plant  development  of  the  palm  trees.  The  Productivity \nTrio  has  been  implemented  in  cleared  areas  where  the  slash  and  burn  technique  had  previously \nbeen usual. By using the Trio system, it has been possible to double cassava yields  without using \nfertilizer, by focusing on using the best spacing to plant seedlings, clearing the areas and selecting \ncassava seedlings. As the planted palm trees take  three  years to begin producing fruit, and given \nthat cassava crops are the foundation of family farming in the area, cassava is grown between the \nrows of palm trees, in line with the following principles: \n\n  Non-encouragement of monoculture in family farming; \n\n  Diversification  of  production,  given  that  many  other  crops  besides  cassava  may  be \nintercropped (including corn, rice, beans and  watermelon), provided that technical spacing \ncriteria are followed, as guided by Biopalma’s  technical  team; \n\n  Guaranteed food security for the families benefited by Biopalma’s  Family  Farming  Program; \n\n  Guaranteed income even before oil palm fruit production begins,  given that the palm trees \n\ncomplement income produced by other food crops (beans, corn, rice and fruits). \n\nBiopalma  is  a  company  with  the  mission  to  produce  palm  oil  and  byproducts  in  a  sustainable \nmanner.  Our  operational  excellence  makes  us  a  leading  company  in  the  market,  and  this \nrecognition  has  only  been  possible  thanks  to  work  performed  with  respect  for  safety  and  the \nenvironment. \n\n20)  Belo Monte \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Um dos projetos mais polêmicos em que a Vale está envolvida, na sua \ncrescente busca por energia, é a construção da usina hidrelétrica de Belo Monte na Volta Grande \ndo Rio Xingu, no estado do Pará.

As  motivações  para  a  redução  da  sua \nparticipação  no  Nesa  não  são  totalmente  claras.  Os  grandes  atrasos  na  construção  e  as \nconstantes  atualizações  de  custos  evidenciam  que  Belo  Monte  não  é  economicamente  viável, \ncomo os movimentos sociais apontam há décadas.” \n\nEnglish version: “One  of   the  most  controversial  projects  in   which   Vale   is  involved,  in  its   growing  \npursuit of energy, is the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant in the Volta Grande (“Big  \nBend”)  of  the  Xingu River, in the state of Pará.

Major  delays  in  construction  and  constant  cost  increases \ndemonstrate that Belo Monte is not economically viable, as social movements have been saying for \ndecades.” \n\nVale’s Response \n\nIn March 2015, Vale transferred its 9% stake in Norte Energia Participações S.A. (the Belo Monte \nhydroelectric  power  plant)  to  Aliança  Norte  Energia  Participações  (Aliança  Norte),  a  joint  venture \nbetween Vale and Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nVale now indirectly holds a 4.59% interest in Belo Monte, while Cemig GT has a 4.41% stake in the \nproject through Aliança Norte. This  reduction  in  Vale’s  interest  in  Belo Monte is in line with its global \nstrategy  to  focus  on  its  core  business,  without  harming  the  availability  of  electric  power  for  its \noperations. \n\nThrough  Aliança  Norte,  Vale  appoints  one  member  and  a  respective  alternate  member  to  Norte \nEnergia’s   Board   of   Directors,   with   the   right   to   one   vote   at   meetings,   where   subjects   need   to   be  \napproved  by  a  vote  of  at  least  eight  members.

There are also no plans to resettle villages, in line with the \nproject’s  commitment  to  reduce  its  impacts on the surrounding area and local communities. \n\nDuring  its  implementation  phase,  the  project  is  investing  around  R$4.23  billion  in  social  and \nenvironmental initiatives, of which R$2.74 billion had been spent by February 2015 (64% of the total \nplanned  amount).  The  management  of  social  and  environmental  aspects  is  guided  by  the  Basic \nEnvironmental  Plan,  which  is  being  implemented  through  117  programs,  plans  and  projects, \nencompassing  social, \ninvestments,  aimed  at \ncompensating  for  and  mitigating  the  potential  impacts  identified  in  the  environmental  viability \nstudies.  \n\nland-related  and  physical-biotic \n\nindigenous, \n\nSocial investments in local municipalities and indigenous communities represent around 60% of the \nbudget, covering social, cultural, economic and infrastructure aspects. \n\nThey include initiatives to  monitor and  improve health, education, training,  income generation and \nappreciation  of  cultural  and  intangible  heritage.  Of  these  investments,  108  projects  have  been \ncompleted  to  build  or  renovate  schools,  basic  health  centers  and  hospitals  (in  rural  and  urban \nareas), and by the end of the project there should be 136 new facilities. In programs for indigenous \npeople, more than R$226.3 million of the planned R$358.7 million has already been invested. \n\nAs part of social and environmental requirements related to the creation of Belo  Monte’s  reservoir,  \nwork  is  under  way  to  comply  with  the  National  Solid  Waste  Plan,  which  has  involved  remediating \nexisting dumps, completed in October 2012, and implementing sanitary landfills, in operation since \nearly  2013,  for  the  municipalities  of  Altamira  and  Vitória  do  Xingu,  benefiting  a  population  of \napproximately 120,000 people.  \n\nAlso  in  2013,  work  began  on  building  these  municipalities’   entire   water   and   sewage  systems, \ninvolving  investments  of  around  R$500  million  and  completed  in  late  2014,  significantly  improving \nthe way urban waste is disposed of in the region, where conditions used to be much worse than in \nBrazil as a whole. \n\nAs  the  reservoir  is  formed,  the  urban  population  living  in  areas  of  “palafitas”  (houses  on  stilts)  in  the  \ncity  of  Altamira  is  being  resettled  in  new  neighborhoods.

As a result, in 2014 a Supreme Resolution (nº 288-\n2014-PCM) was issued and a number of meetings and participatory monitoring activities under this \ninitiative took place. As for the previous consultation in San Martin de Sechura; the process is not \ncarried out by the investment project lead, but by the relevant governmental body which, in the case \nof the mining sector in Peru, is the Ministry of Energy and Mines. In order to approve inception of \nMiski Mayo operations, the Ministry established that there was no need for a previous consultation, \ngiven that San Martín de Sechura Community is not an indigenous population. In addition to that, at \nthat particular moment, previous consultation processes had not been regulated by local legislation \n(which  entered  into  force  in  2011).  The  Vice  ministry  of  Intercultural  Affairs  within  the  Ministry  of \nCulture,  which  is  the  body  in  charge  of  recognizing  Indigenous  populations  in  Peru,  does  not \nacknowledge  the  presence  of  Indigenous  populations  in  the  Piura  department,  where  the  San \nMartín de Sechura community  is located.

A Fundação Vale e o SIFEMA (Sindicato das Indústrias de Ferro Gusa do \nEstado do Maranhão) se comprometeram perante o Ministério Público a complementar os recursos \nfaltantes  nessa etapa da construção.  Em dezembro de 2014 o  projeto foi tecnicamente aprovado \npela  CEF  e  desde  então  aguarda  seleção  pelo  Ministério  das  Cidades.  Com  a  contratação  do \nprojeto, faltará ainda definir os responsáveis pelo financiamento da construção dos equipamentos \npúblicos e sociais necessários. A empresa Vale, ao reconhecer a sua parcela de responsabilidade, \ndeveria  rever  suas  práticas  para  que  suas  operações  e  as  das  empresas  siderúrgicas  venham  a \nrespeitar as leis e os padrões ambientais nacionais e internacionais referentes à qualidade do ar e \nda água.” \n\nEnglish  version:  “The  struggle  for  territory  in  Piquiá  de  Baixo.  Steelmaking  activity  in  Piquiá  de \nBaixo,  a  neighborhood  of  Açailândia,  Maranhão,  conducted  in  close  partnership  with  Vale,  is \ngenerating serious health problems among thousands of people who live nearby. Vale supplies the \nraw  material  to  the  steel  mills  and  transports  their  manufactured  goods  using  the  EFC,  which \npasses  next  to  the  neighborhood.  There  are  five  plants  that  process  the  mining   company’s   iron,  \nspewing  into  the  air  toxic  fumes  that  continually  provoke  diseases  and  deaths.  Despite  blatantly \nviolating   Vale’s   ‘Suppliers’   Code   of   Ethics   and   Conduct,’  the  steelmakers  rely  on  the  company  to \ntransport 100% of the pig iron they produce via the Carajás Railroad. Since 2005, the Community \nAssociation  of  Residents  of  Piquiá  de  Baixo  has  demanded  measures  to  control  and  reduce  this \npollution,  to  hold  the  companies  liable   for   the   damage   caused   to   residents’   health,   and   to  \ncollectively  resettle  the  community,  which  consists  of  312  families,  to  another  area  free  from \ncontamination. \n\nThe  resettlement  proposed  for  Piquiá  de  Baixo  does  not  only  involve  delivering  minimum  living \nconditions for homeless people, but will also make it possible to restore  the  families’  quality  of  life,  \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The  severity  of  the  facts  and  the  lack  of  effective \nmeasures taken by the Brazilian state and companies to curb the perpetuation of violations led the \nUnited Nations to submit four Special Reports to the Brazilian state on January 9, 2014, requesting \ninformation about the contamination that the community of Piquiá de Baixo has suffered. \n\nThe United Nations special rapporteurs Anand Grover (regarding the right of all people to enjoy the \nhighest  level  of  mental  and  physical  health),  Marc  Pallemaerts  (regarding  the  implications  for \nhuman  rights  of  the  environmentally  appropriate  disposal  and  management  of  dangerous \nsubstances and waste), Catarina Albuquerque (regarding the human right to sanitation and drinking \nwater)  and  Alexandra  Guáqueta  (a  member  of  the Working  Group  on  human  rights,  transnational \ncorporations  and  other  companies)  have  asked  the  Brazilian  state  to  present  responses  to  10 \nquestions ranging from factual matters to the preventive measures used by the state to prevent the \ncompanies’  activities  from  continuing  to  have  the  same  impacts on  the  community’s  human  rights, \nas well as measures to hold the companies involved liable. \n\nTo enable the resettlement and in the absence of any other options, the Community Association of \nResidents of Pequiá took over the process and submitted a funding proposal to  Caixa Econômica \nFederal  (CEF),  as   part   of   the   ‘Minha  Casa  Minha  Vida  Entidades’   public   housing   program.  The \nprogram’s   resources   will   pay  for  around  70%  of  the  work  to  build  the  houses  and  basic \ninfrastructure of the new neighborhood. The Vale Foundation and Maranhão State Pig Iron Industry \nAssociation  (SIFEMA)  made  a  commitment  to  the  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  to  provide  the \nremaining resources during this construction stage. In December 2014, the project was technically \napproved by CEF and since then it has been awaiting selection by the Cities Ministry. As part of the \nprocess  of  contracting  for  the  project,  the  parties  responsible  for  funding  the  construction  of  the \nnecessary public and social facilities have not  yet been determined. Vale, recognizing its share of \nthe  responsibility,  should  review  its  practices  to  ensure  that  its  operations  and  those  of  steel \ncompanies respect national and international  environmental  laws and standards regarding  air and \nwater quality.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nThe main source of the problems affecting the community of Piquiá de Baixo is pig iron production \nemissions  in  the  Açailândia  steelmaking  complex.  Vale  participates  in  the  production  chain  by \nsupplying iron ore and transporting pig iron. Despite that the impacts generated by pig iron plants \nare not directly related to Vale, which has not had any pig iron operations in the region since 2010, \nwhen  Vale  seized  and  sold  its  pig  iron  assets,  we  maintain  dialogue  with  the  community.  This \ndialogue, which has included local civil society organizations and the public authorities, is aimed at \ndiagnosing  the  problems  indicated  by  the  community  and  participating  in  solutions  arising  from \nindustrial activities in the pig iron chain. \n\nTo  meet  a  request  from  the  Public  Prosecution  Ministry  in  Açailândia,  Vale,  through  the  Vale \nFoundation, produced a socioeconomic diagnosis of the 330 families in the community in question. \nThis diagnosis involved extensive community participation, and was completed and submitted to the \nPublic  Prosecution  Ministry  at  the  start  of  2011.  During  the  process,  a  commission  of  30  families \nwas  established  to  represent  all  the  families  involved.  The  aim  of  this  work  was  to  identify  the \nfamilies’   profile,  involving  visits  to  support  the  project  to  construct  a  new  neighborhood  to  house \nthem, in line with the desire expressed by the community.  \n\nIn  October  2014,  the  Vale  Foundation  formally  entered  into  a  partnership  with  the  Community \nAssociation of Piquiá and CAIXA, undertaking to support the construction of 312 houses to rehouse \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

This  proposal  is  being \nanalyzed  by  CAIXA  and  awaiting  selection  by  the  Cities  Ministry  to  contract  the  project.

By trying to challenge the process of recognizing \nthe  quilombola  lands,  Vale  once  more  demonstrates  its  modus  operandi  to  enable  its  projects  by \ndepriving social groups of free enjoyment of the different social, economic, environmental, cultural \nand  historical  possibilities  of  their  territories.  In  September  2014,  the  EFC  was  occupied  by  rural \nworkers  from  35  quilombola  communities  in  Maranhão,  who  demanded  a  series  of  measures  to \nguarantee  their  territorial  rights.

These  partnerships \nare  designed  to  form  an  inter-sector  alliance  that  results  in  the  construction  of  a  shared  work \nagenda with the following aims:  \n\n  Promote quality of life and human development; \n\n  Strengthen inter-sectoral interaction and public policies; \n\n  Expand democratic participation from an angle of citizenship inclusion; \n\n  Ensure the effectiveness of private sector social investments; \n\n  Uphold  collective  construction  and  the  role  of  citizens  as  both  beneficiaries  and  co-\n\nparticipants in the regional development process. \n\nThe  Vale  Foundation’s  Education  area runs continuing training projects for education professionals \nin  accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  public  education  policies.  Accordingly,  the  content  of  training \nprocesses  is  aligned  with  the  proposals  of  the  Education  Ministry  and  based  on  prevailing \nlegislation, especially the  Law on National  Education Guidelines and Foundations  (Law 9,394/96). \nOur  training  projects  are  executed  by  renowned  institutions  in  the  education  area,  such  as  public \nuniversities  and  NGOs,  and  based  on  academic  research  results.  The  teaching  materials  used  in \nthis  training  are  provided  digitally  on   the   Vale   Foundation’s   website,  in  order  to  ensure  the \ntransparency of the approach used and permit in-depth knowledge about the activities conducted. \n\nIn  2014,  we  trained  552  teachers  and  42  school  managers.  Also  this  year,  we  held  a  range  of \nmeetings  with   the   authors   of   children’s   books,  with  the  participation  of  over  2,000  teachers  and \n4,500 students. In these meetings over 1,800 cases containing over 18,000 books were provided to \n1st  to  3rd  year  elementary  school  classes.  In  addition,  the  Vale  Foundation  has  seven  Learning \nHouses,  integration  spaces  for  the  exchange  of  experience  and  access  to  different  educational \nactivities that are available to the whole community. \n\nWe also clarify that the Vale Foundation is a duly constituted non-profit institution that possesses a \nFederal  Public  Utility  Title,  meaning  that  it  is  exempt  from  taxes  on  its  revenues  inherent  to  its \nactivities, in accordance with the Federal Constitution, article 150, VI, c. This characteristic enables \ncompanies to make donations of sums that would otherwise be paid in corporate income tax. \n\n27) \n\nSocial management tools and Sustainability Action Plan \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Diálogo social, gestão de demandas, estudos socioeconômicos, plano \nplurianual  de   dispêndios   sociais:   ferramenta   de   aferição   do   chamado   “risco   social”,   ou   seja,   de  \ndeterminar  as  chances  de  que  uma  comunidade  possa  se  mobilizar  para  o  debate  e  o \nquestionamento dos projetos; cooptação e divisão de comunidades. \n\nAtravés  de  ações  de  assistência  social,  em  especial  do  Programa  de  Ação  de  Sustentabilidade \n(PAS),   a   Vale   aplica   uma   série   de   “políticas   de   resignação”,   oferecendo   respostas   simbólicas  \nlimitadas  sob  a  forma  de  compensação  ou  mitigação.” \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

A  parceria  da  Vale  com  uma  das \ninstituições  públicas  de  maior  relevância  na  produção  de  conhecimento  do  país  é  uma  forma  da \nempresa  validar  sua  imagem  de  grande  incentivadora  de  novas  tecnologias  e  práticas  para  o \ninvisibilizando  sua  atuação  como  um  dos  maiores  atores \ndesenvolvimento  sustentável, \nresponsáveis  por  graves  conflitos  socioambientais,  tanto  no  Brasil  como  em  outros  países.

An example of this kind of investment by the company was \nthe  launch  of  the  Vale-Capes  Science  and  Sustainability  Awards,  created  through  a  partnership \nbetween the Brazilian Education Ministry’s  graduate  education  support  agency (Capes) and Vale. \n\nEstablished  during  the  Rio  +20  Conference,  this  scheme  distributes  prizes  for  PhD  and  MA \ndissertations associated with environmental and social topics. Vale’s  partnership  with  one  of  Brazil’s  \nleading public institutions in the field of knowledge production is a way for the company to validate \nits image as an important promoter of new technologies and practices for sustainable development, \ncloaking  its  action  as  one  of  the  main  players  responsible  for  serious  social  and  environmental \nconflicts, both in Brazil and other countries. Furthermore, this partnership harms scientific autonomy \nin the study of relations between the environment and society in Brazil, especially with regard to the \nmining sector.” \n\nVale’s  Response \n\nSince 2009, when it created its Technology and Innovation Department, Vale has been establishing \ndistinctive ways of interacting with the science and technology community. This movement is based \non   the   company’s   perception  that  its  frontiers  need  to  be  expanded  to  permit  broader  and  more \nstructured  dialogue  with  other  players.  By  expanding  its  frontiers  and  developing  closer \nrelationships with academic institutions, the company shows that it values institutional coordination \nand  the  pursuit  of  complementary  interests  and  ways  of  working.  This  stance  is  aligned  with  the \nprinciple of open innovation, through which divergent views give way to cooperation and institutional \ncoordination.  \n\nIn  line  with  this  model,  Vale  has  developed  several  initiatives  together  with  the  academic \ncommunity,  including  the  launches  of  public  contests  in  partnership  with  government  entities  to \npromote  scientific  knowledge.  These  initiatives  include  the  Vale-Capes  Science  and  Sustainability \n\nEthics and Conduct Office \nAv.

The initiative \nwas implemented through a national public contest, in which any student who completed an MA or \nPhD  course  in  2001,  at  any  Brazilian  university,  could  take  part.  In  its  latest  edition  (2014),  127 \npapers  were  submitted  from  all  over  Brazil  (90  MA  and  37  PhD  dissertations),  up  from  110  the \nprevious year. The award-winning papers included studies about the use of solar energy and social \ntechnologies  to  combat  poverty,  both  from  states  that  do  not  have  Vale  operations.  Given  the \ninitiative’s  success, Capes will not only maintain the awards in the coming years, but also proposes \nto hold a seminar regarding the winning entries for the next edition. \n\nVale  believes  that  a  modern  and  developed  society  is  the  result  of  dialogue,  in  which  differences \nare  viewed  as  opportunities  and  solutions  are  constructed  through  institutional  cooperation. \nAccordingly, university-company relationships are an ideal solution. \n\n29) \n\nCOMEFC \n\nText of 2015 Unsustainability Report \n\nOriginal Portuguese text: “Em 2013, no Maranhão, 23 prefeituras decidiram se reunir para criar o \nConsórcio dos Municípios da Estrada de Ferro Carajás (Comefc).

Furthermore, it will indirectly have a \nnegative effect on other fundamental rights such as Freedom of Association.  \n\nH&M firmly believes that employees in the garment industry should have the right to legal employment \ncontracts. We always require that the suppliers we work with follow national legislation and implement \nawards from the Arbitration Council Foundation. Today, a majority of the employees at the supplier \nfactories in Cambodia are employed on fixed duration contracts due to many years of misinterpretation \nof the labour legislation. Such a frequent use of fixed duration contracts is not acceptable for H&M.  \n\nTo achieve a change towards un-fixed duration contracts, that are valid for an unlimited time, H&M has \nimplemented stricter requirements towards the suppliers that we work with. Since 2015, the suppliers \nmust guarantee that workers that have been employed for two years should have an un-fixed duration \ncontract.  \n\n  Our stricter requirement is supported by the Arbitration Council Foundation, AFC.  \n  Suppliers that employ workers over two years on fixed duration contracts will be seen as being \n\nin violation of our code of conduct requirements. \n\n  All suppliers with this violation will be required to create a remediation plan for how to transfer \n\nworkers from fixed to un-fixed duration contracts. \n\n  Our factory auditors will then follow up on the implementation of these plans.  \n\nThe illegal use of short-term employment is an industry-wide problem and therefore, we also work \nclosely with other stakeholders in the industry such as suppliers, employers associations, trade unions, \ncivil society and other buyers as well as engage with the Cambodian government. Our work to \nstrengthen social dialogue and industrial relations is also an important component to ensure respect for \nworkers’ rights in Cambodia. By engaging in these ways we will contribute to pushing this important \nwork forward. \n\nFor further information about our sustainability program, please visit http://www.hm.com/sustainability"}

Many of the issues described such as involuntary overtime, harsh language and \ndiscrimination of trade union representatives are examples of systemic problems in the industry which \nwe are addressing in our own sustainability program as well as in collaboration with trade unions, other \ncompanies and stakeholders. \n\nMonitoring our suppliers is an important part of our work and has been for more than 15 years, and we \nhave seen improvement in many areas, which for instance is demonstrated by the continuous increase \nof our ICoC compliance score (H&M Sustainability Report 2014 p.31). But we believe that bringing about \nsustainable change on complex issues, such as wages or freedom of association, require more than just \nmonitoring and work to create sustainable progress with the active participation of our suppliers’ \nfactories and their employees. To tackle issues at an industry – or country – level, we also believe in \nengaging with industry bodies and governments, as well as trade unions, NGOs and other brands. With \nour engagement in ACT and the collaboration with IndustriALL Global Union we jointly work to address \nindustry wide issues such as Fair Living Wages, Freedom of Association, Collective Bargaining and \nhighlighting the importance of job creation and industry development. \n\nThis is a vital part of our approach and our daily work. With the support of our global team, our regional \nsustainability and supply chain teams in India therefore focus particularly on three major areas: \n\nCapacity building & supplier ownership \n\nLasting improvements require our suppliers to understand their sustainability issues better and to see \nthe benefits of good social and environmental performance. In the long run, we want our suppliers to \ntake charge of their own sustainability. Besides auditing their progress, we focus on supporting our \nsuppliers by building up management knowledge and capabilities and helping them to assess their own \nperformance so that they can detect opportunities to improve their business as well as their \nsustainability performance, including working conditions. \n\nRaising workers’ awareness of their rights and Social Dialogue \n\nOur suppliers’ employees also need to be equipped with knowledge about their rights and how to claim \ntheir rights. Ultimately, we want them to be able to influence their situation through dialogue with their \nemployers and through our work for well-functioning industrial relations in collaboration with our \npartners our aim is to enable them to do this. Achieving well-functioning industrial relations remains a \nchallenge today as many sourcing countries, including India, lack adequate systems for industrial \n\n \n \n \n \n\frelations and, even if they do exist, workers’ committees and/or trade unions do not always have the \ncapabilities or the enabling environment function effectively. \n\nTo tackle these challenges, we have in recent years run projects like “Right & Responsibilities \nInformation Films” to raise workers’ awareness of their rights. This project was designed to train \nworkers through multiple films based on Overtime, Health and Safety, Abuse and Grievance, Good \nWorking Environment and Workers Representation. The project was initiated in 2013 in Bangalore and \nlater scaled up to Tirupur. Currently almost all workers working at our supplier factories in Bangalore \nand Tirupur are trained on Rights and Responsibilities films. \n\nIn 2015 we have initiated a “Social Dialogue Project” with the goal to establish democratically elected \nworker committees at our supplier factories. Our first goal is to have democratically elected worker \nrepresentation, trade unions or worker committees, at all strategic factories by 2018. Currently 10 \nfactories in Bangalore are part of this project in the initial phase and more than 7500 workers will get \ntrained on the importance and effectiveness of Social Dialogue and Communication systems in the \nworkplace.  \n\nFair Living Wage \n\nWages in our supply chain are a key focus of our sustainability work. We want all workers in our supplier \nfactories to earn a fair living wage. A fair living wage should always meet the basic needs of the workers \nand their families as well as provide some discretionary income and it should be negotiated between the \nparties on the labour market, ideally through collective bargaining. A key part of our Fair Living Wage \nRoadmap, is to work with our strategic suppliers to implement the Fair Wage Method, which should \nensure that well managed pay structures are in place addressing skill recognitions, incentive programs, \nadditional bonuses and legal benefits which are well communicated and understood by the workers.  \nOur goal for 2018 is that all our strategic suppliers should have improved pay structures for fair living \nwages in place. \n\nFor further information about our Fair Living Wage roadmap, please visit: \nFair Living Wage Roadmap on the H&M webpage \nFair Living Wage roadmap, Half-year update \n\nFor further information about our Industrial Relations strategy, please read more here: \nH&M Sustainability Report 2014, page 49-51 \nGlobal Framework Agreement between IndustriALL Global Union, IF Metall and H&M \n\nFor further information about our sustainability program, please visit http://www.hm.com/sustainability"}

To further speed up the remediation, we are currently working closely together with IndustriALL to \nensure the most efficient remediation in H&M supply chain and to use our combined leverage where needed. \nWe will continue our long-term investment by fully supporting our business partners in improving and \nupgrading their production facilities to safer and higher international standards as well as their management \ncapabilities, allowing them to become competitive in a sustainable way. \n\nFire exits are one of the most fundamental requirements for a supplier in order to be allowed to produce for \nH&M. There have always been clear escape routes in our suppliers factories although they are in the process \nof being improved in accordance with new standards. We are in close dialogue with the suppliers and are \nfollowing up on the work that remains to be done. According to the latest information, the total amount of \nissues that have been handled has increased by 80 percent since October 2015 \n\nWe are fully transparent with our supplier list and as such we welcome critical investigations. We appreciate \nthat the report authors gives credit to this transparency in helping to make the report possible, and since last \nreport The Accord publically available data is now updated to better reflect the current actual status of \nremediation, which help the dialogue about improvement and gaps to address. \n\nComment on the recent fire in Matrix Sweater Ltd \n\nAfter the fire in Matrix Sweater Ltd., Accord and Alliance have done investigations and both recommends not \nto continue production until further investigations, assessments, and remediation have been done. There are \nmainly two reasons given for currently recommend that the building remain vacant until certain measures are \ntaken. \n\n1. Due to extensive structural damage to the 7th and 8th floor, a concern arises over the safety of all \nthe lower floors until a structural remediation plan which considers immediate and longer term \nremediation requirements is done. Until the structural assessment is done by a credible engineering \nfirm, and all immediate actions to ensure the safety of building occupants is completed, no occupation \nof the building is recommended. We will be telling our brands the same message. \n\n2. Due to extensive firefighting water usage and potential damage to electrical systems, a certified \nelectrician must check the electrical system prior to re-energizing the system. Until such time, no \noccupation of the building is recommended. \n\nWe strongly recommend Matrix to not start any production until Accord/Alliance recommended actions have \nbeen taken and factory is deemed safe for production again. It is very important that Matrix clearly \ncommunicates what is going on to workers and ensure them they will be compensated and taken care of \nresponsibly. H&M will ensure support to Matrix in this process, and we want to state that Matrix Sweater Ltd is \nfully cooperating in a responsible manner on the recommendations.   \n\nWe can at this time not give an estimate how long the factory will be suspended.  \n\nFeb 4, 2016: Accord statement and information on the fire at Matrix Sweaters Ltd \nhttp://bangladeshaccord.org/2016/02/statement-on-fire-at-matrix-sweaters-ltd/  \n\nSep 30, 2015: Fire and building safety in Bangladesh \nhttp://about.hm.com/en/news/newsroom/news.html/en/fire-and-building-safety-in-bangladesh.html \n\nOct 6, 2015: H&M comments on the report on the Bangladesh Fire and Building Safety \nhttp://about.hm.com/en/news/newsroom/news.html/en/hm-comments-on-the-report-on-the-bangladesh-fire-and-building-safety.html \n\nFor further information about the Accord and official status, please visit http://bangladeshaccord.org/  \n\nFor further information about our sustainability program, please visit http://www.hm.com/sustainability"}

H&M has one of the highest sustainability standards in the textile industry for its suppliers \nand have for many years put great efforts in the manufacturing countries to improve working conditions \nand strengthen workers' rights. We are humble about the challenge of long-term change for all the people \nwho make H&M's products. Meanwhile, we are confident that our presence in Cambodia and other \nproducing countries has a positive effect. By being present in the production countries, reach agreements \ntogether with manufacturers and evaluate our own part, we can slowly but surely contribute to lasting \nimprovements. \n\nWe take a positive view on wage increases and we want suppliers to pay their employees a fair living \nwage. As mentioned in the report, we have developed a Fair Living Wage strategy that involves not only \nbuyers but also suppliers, factory employees and governments. It has been drawn up in consultation with \nglobal trade unions, suppliers and non-profit organizations. Our approach is that wages should be \nnegotiated between the parties on the labour market. Our initial goal is that all our strategic suppliers \nshould have pay structures allowing fair living wages in place by 2018. Implementation and scaling up is \nprogressing with 68 factories during 2015 and additional 80 factories during 2016. \n\nAccording to the ILO and global unions, there is no universal benchmark on how to calculate a living \nwage. Instead, they stress the importance of promoting freedom of association and collective bargaining \nas necessary for workers and employers to negotiate wages and conditions of work. We share this view \nand that is why we focus on improved industrial relations rather than setting a certain wage living wage \nlevel. \n\nHowever, as we are well aware that the opportunities for employees to negotiate are limited in many \ncountries, we are involved in projects and programs aiming for a strengthening of employees’ rights and \ntheir ability to negotiate through trade unions or other elected employee representatives. We are running \nindustrial relations and social dialogue projects in place in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India and \nEthiopia. In 2016 we will also start the same projects in Myanmar.  \n\nIn Cambodia, we contribute to industrial relations with training in for example negotiation and conflict \nmanagement together with ILO, the Swedish trade union IF Metall and SIDA. The customised training \nprogrammes consist of workplace cooperation, labour law and dispute resolution, effective \ncommunication and negotiation skill with the aim to build trust and stronger relations between workers \nand management. During 2015, amongst others 1,213 union representatives and 1,030 factory managers \nhave completed the industrial relation training and all participating factories and their trade union \nrepresentatives have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on improving industrial relations as well as \nan agreement to eliminate unfair labour practices.  \n\nCollaboration is crucial to achieve real change and that is also why H&M is collaborating with different \nparties in the textile industry. We work together with our suppliers but also with local and global trade \nunions and governments. Together with other brands and the global trade union IndustriALL, we work on \na strategy to improve wages in the garment industry. H&M has also signed a General Framework \nAgreement with IndustriALL aiming for a well-functioning dialogue between the employer and the \nemployee at the supplier factories that work with H&M. The GFA is highly relevant for Cambodia given the \nnumerous and active trade unions there, and our investment and involvement in improving industrial \nrelations in the country. The GFA supports H&M’s already existing work to promote freedom of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fassociation, collective bargaining and peaceful conflict solution in all the countries where we have \nsuppliers.  \n\nBesides from collaboration, we also believe transparency is a key catalyst of positive change. Therefore, \nwe have published our supplier list and we constantly keep track of where our products are being \nproduced. In this way we can focus our sustainability program and continuously improve the working \nconditions for the 1.6 million workers who are employed by our suppliers. We also publish our \nsustainability result in our yearly published Sustainability Report. \n\nOur goal is for all employees in the textile industry to earn a fair living wage, however; development takes \ntime. We want to further accelerate our work, but we must be patient since it is a complex issue that \naffects not only the suppliers we work with, but also other actors. Raising wages in the textile industry is a \nshared responsibility involving a number of stakeholders with which we have continuous dialogue with.  \n\nFor further information about our Fair Living Wage roadmap, please visit: \nFair Living Wage Roadmap on the H&M webpage \nFair Living Wage roadmap, Half-year update \n\nFor further information about our sustainability program, please visit http://www.hm.com/sustainability"}

We thought it important to highlight that Facing Finance did not contact us at any point \nin  the  compilation  of  their  report.  As  such,  it  includes  some  factual  errors  and \ninconsistencies which we detail accordingly below.  \n\n2. Importantly, the report notes ‘Inditex (Zara) has also been implicated in forced labour in \nsweatshops in Argentina’ with a reference to an Al  Jazeera article. This is incorrect. It \nrefers to an instance when La Alameda, an Argentinian NGO denounced the existence of \nthree irregular workshops supposedly sourcing several brands, including Zara. In fact, this \n\n \n \n \n \n\faccusation is completely untrue, as the Court in Buenos Aires has definitely proved and \nconfirmed in one sentence. \n\n3. The content of the report also incorrectly describes Inditex’s ‘proximity model’ where it \nsays  ‘meaning  production  takes  place  close  to  the  brand’s  consumer  markets’  and \ndescribes this as the reason for Inditex’s proportion of sourced products in Brazil. In fact \nour ‘proximity sourcing model’ refers to the fact that 60% of Inditex’s production takes \nplace in or close to its distribution centres in Spain. Less than 35% of products sold \nby  Zara  Brasil  are  made  in  Brazil  which  in  fact  represents  less  than  1%  of  global \nmanufacturing for Inditex. \n\n4. In the Facing Finance report’s methodology it included companies with a focus on recent \nevents (to include events in the previous three years). It does not happen in the Inditex \npage.  We  note  that  a  large  part  of  the  report’s  section  on  Inditex  is  related  to  a  case \ninvolving a supplier of Inditex which occurred back in 2011, five years ago. This does not \nreflect the current picture of Brazil’s supply chain. Actually, there have been several \ninitiatives that no other company has taken in the supervision of the supply chain and in \noffering  customers  specific  details  of  the  suppliers’  performance.  Some  of  them  are \nmentioned below.  \n\nThe Facing Finance story raises a number of points, so we hope to build understanding \nby commenting on each specifically.  \n\nConfirmed facts of Inditex Responsible Performance \nA) Actual initiatives taken in Brazil. We note that a large portion of the section on Inditex \nwas  lifted  verbatim  out  of  the  SOMO  Reporter  Brazil  (May,  2015)  (‘From  moral \nresponsibility to legal liability? http://www.somo.nl/’). Yet Facing Finance’s report focused \non  the  historical  background  section  of  this  SOMO  report,  but  missed  details  of  the \nsignificant efforts carried out by Inditex since 2012 to guarantee the correct performance \nin terms of labour rights in the Brazilian companies that manufacture its products.  \n\nWe kindly ask you to review the conclusions of the report itself on page 55 of the SOMO \n(http://www.somo.nl/publications-\nreport \nn/Publication_4188/picture/image_view_fullscreen) \nthough  we  can  also  provide  a \nsummary of the actions Inditex has taken in Brazil here: \n\n• \nSince  2011,  Inditex  has  reported  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of \ninspections  performed  at  its  Brazilian  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  either  by  the \n\n \n\fcompany’s own staff or by outside consultants. To be exact, since 2012, Inditex has \ncarried  out  more  than  2,800  audits  to  the  Brazilian  companies  that  manufacture  its \nproducts,  supported  by  the  most  demanding  international  procedures  based  on  our \nFramework  Agreement  with  the  Global  Federation  of  Unions  (IndustriALL,  which \nrepresents  50  million  workers  in  144  Countries)  and  performed  by  prestigious \ninternational and independent agencies as Intertek, SGS and Apcer. Inditex can firmly \nguarantee  the  correct  performance  of  this  Brazilian  supply  chain  in  terms  of  labour \nstandards. \n\nNot  only  did  the  company  increase  the  number  of  audits,  it  also  strengthened  its \nmonitoring mechanisms, in cooperation with the Brazilian Textile, Garment, Leather and \nFootwear Workers’ Federation. \n\n• \nInditex undertook efforts to stimulate suppliers’ compliance with the Inditex code of \nconduct  by  creating  a  good  practices  manual  for  suppliers;  by  adopting  a  social \ncompliance  certification  scheme;  and  by  implementing  pilot  projects  at  suppliers  in \ncooperation with UNIETHOS. \n\nTogether with Brazilian civil society organizations, the company has also promoted \n• \ninvestments in immigrant communities’ projects. The results of which can so far be \nsummarized as so:  \n\n-  Creation  of  an  Emergency  Fund  which  has  helped  over  40,000  people. \n-  10,000  people  attended  in  the  effort  to  support  the  documentation  of  migrant \nworkers. \n- 90,000 participants in various activities designed to help vulnerable immigrants \nand youths. \n-  Professional  training  projects  in  the  garment  sector  and  related  activities. \n- Funding for the creation of the CIC, which is expected to benefit 1,000 immigrants \neach  day.  The  institution  supports  the  regularization  of  their  migratory  situation \npromoting vocational training. \n-  Overall investment in community projects of over BRL14 million.  \n-  In  this  same line,  Inditex has  collaborated closely with  renowned NGOs  on this \ntask, including CDHIC, CAMI and Missão Paz.  \n\nZara Brasil announced in May 2014 the launch of the ‘Manufactured in Brazil’ \n• \n(‘Fabricado no Brasil’) initiative. All the labels of garments made in the country have \na QR code to allow full access to information about the manufacturing details of each \n\n \n\fand every garment, including social and working conditions across the production line. \nThis is a radical and unprecedented initiative to open up our supply chain in Brazil. We \nbelieve  this  is  a  sign  of  our  commitment  to  improving  conditions,  which  we  believe \nsurpasses that of our peers. \n\n• \nZara  Brasil’s  complaints  hotline  was  significantly  strengthened  when  the \ncompany outsourced the operation of the service to the Center for Human Rights and \nImmigrant  Citizenship  (CDHIC),  thereby  providing  an  avenue  for  “legal  and  social \nreferrals of accounts by immigrants of any nationality who want[ed] to report cases of \ndiscrimination and/or working conditions analogous to slavery”. \n\nB)  Legal defense. The Facing  Finance  report  also  referenced the  pending  legal  case \nbetween Zara Brasil and the Brazilian authorities regarding the Cadastro (so called dirty \nlist) instigated in 2012, stating ‘Zara’s irresponsible legal strategy undermines Brazilian \nefforts to eradicate modern-day slavery’. We refute this statement. We viewed this case \nas an administrative process and as a democratic right to defend the company's reputation \nof what it understands as an unfair decision that in no way impacted Inditex’ continued \neffort to improve working conditions in Brazil. Inditex continues to amply demonstrate its \ncommitment to fighting for better social and labour conditions.  \n\nImportantly, it is worth highlighting that the Cadastro was suspended in December 2014 \nby  the  Federal  Court  of  Justice  (Supremo  Tribunal  Federal)  of  Brazil  because  of  the \nconstitutional claim filed by an entrepreneur organization, as such, it does not now legally \nworks. And to be sure, Zara Brasil has also never been included in it. \n\nC) Untrue picture of the supply chain. Finally, the Facing Finance report also references \na  report by  the Brazilian  Labour  ministry  which  alleged  that  7,000 workers  were badly \ntreated since 2012. We should highlight that this is an unfair accusation as none of these \nalleged  violations  were  regarding  human  rights  issues  or  modern  slavery.  First  of  all, \nInditex is one of many Brazilian brands producing in those Brazilian factories. Then, most \nof  the  alleged  violations  were  minor  administrative  infringements  such  as  adequate \nseating in staff rooms, that took place two or three years ago (they were recovered in 2015 \nfrom files from between 2012 and 2014) and many of which have been identified through \nInditex' own audits and consequently resolved. \n\nIt is important to highlight that, in any case, during all of that time, the Labour ministry did \nnot once notify Zara Brasil of any irregularities. It is surprising that in many of these cases \ncompanies inspected by the Regional Department of Employment also were not notified. \n\n\fAs a result, this could have prevented steps from being taken to correct issues, should \nthey  not  have  been  picked  up  by  our  own  audits.  This  is  an  important  point,  since \naccording to the Good Conduct Undertaking (TAC) signed on 19 December 2011 Inditex \nshould have been notified of these violations immediately after being found, so they could \nbe corrected within ten days.  \n\nThis also seemed to be a major contradiction implied by denouncing violations in Brazilian \ntextile  business’s  facilities  yet  not  taking  any immediate  corrective action  to  ensure  an \nimprovement in employment conditions.  \n\nAnd, as we have mentioned, it is also worth pointing out that the Labour ministry only \nnamed Zara Brasil in this report, in spite of the fact that Zara Brasil accounted for less than \n15% of the total production of suppliers named.  \n\nThis report is currently under discussion with the Brazilian authorities. \n\nTo summarize regarding Brazil, we also think it useful to include comments from Jyrki \nRaina,  General  Secretary  of  the  IndustriALL  Global  Union,  regarding  Inditex’s  supply \nchain  in  Brazil.  IndustriALL,  as  you  know,  represents  over  50  million  workers  in  142 \ncountries,  including  the  members  of  Brazil’s  garment  sector  union  Sindicato  das \nCostureiras, and fights tirelessly to improve working conditions worldwide. He notes that \n\"a number of joint missions that have been carried out by IndustriALL affiliates and Inditex \nrepresentatives to make improvements in Brazilian factories\", and adds that \"Inditex has \ndeveloped robust systems to prevent, control and remediate potential breaches of \nthe GFA and the company's Code of Conduct [...] Their main objective is to protect and \nstrengthen  workers'  rights  while  training  the  management  and  workers  to  achieve  a \ncommon understanding\". \"With committed partners such as Inditex we are definitely on \nthe right path for ensuring sustainable conditions  of work throughout the global supply \nchain\". \n\nD) Misleading mention to Pull & Bear. Finally, the Facing Finance report referenced \nirregularities found by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights at a factory in \nBangladesh supplying to Pull&Bear. This case is precisely the opposite of what the article \nintends to say. It is actually an example of how the Sustainability Team works at Inditex \nand how to react with a supplier, helping them to reach the best practices.  \n\nThis case is brilliantly summarized in the following article by the Institute for Global Labour \nand  Human Rights:  http://www.globallabourrights.org/alerts/bangladesh-unprecedented-\nturnaround-at-jeans-plus-factory. \n\n\fTo briefly summarize the case, the action taken by Inditex allowed to confirm that: \n\n- Jeans Plus management guarantees that all workers receive their Friday holiday off each \nweek. \n\n- Factory remains open no later than 7:00 p.m. (50% of the workers were released at 5:00 \np.m., while the other 50% worked work until 7:00.) \n\n- Pregnant women workers receive their full maternity benefits. \n\n- All workers receive legal sick leave and earn leave benefits. \n\n- Jeans Plus management guarantees full compliance with all Bangladeshi labor laws. \n\n- Mid-level managers and supervisors were instructed to assure an appropriate treatment \nto workers decently.  \n\nWe highly appreciated the commitment of both the management with the implementation \nof  this  measure  and  the  NGO  Global  Labour  and  Human  Rights  which  has  actively \nfollowed the issue. These fast actions were acknowledged and commended by the IGLHR \nand do feel free to contact them directly should there be any doubts.  \n\nFrom  Inditex’  perspective,  this  is  one  of  the  many  cases  of  the  never-ending  task  to \nguarantee the sustainability in the supply chain, always looking at the medium and long \nterm period. \n\nThank  you  indeed  for  getting  in  touch  for  comment  and  if  you  would  like  any  further \ninformation, or to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to let us know. We keep at \nyour disposal for any further information or clarification required. \n\nBest wishes, \n\nInditex External Relations."}

This programme helps us assess and \naddress labour and human rights issues – including those raised in the latest report of Facing \nFinance – across our value chain in an ongoing manner. Other issues raised in this report are \naddressed through our policies, procedures and commitments to product safety and quality, \nwater stewardship and environmental sustainability. \n\nForced  labour  and  other  human  rights  abuses  have  no  place  in  our  supply  chain.  We  are \ncommitted to eliminating them in the seafood supply chain in Thailand, working alongside others. \nOur mandatory Nestlé Supplier Code and Responsible Sourcing Guideline (RSG) on Fish and \nSeafood require all of our suppliers to respect human rights and to comply with all applicable \nlabour laws. \n\nNestlé’s  NGO  partner  Verité  spent  three  months  in  2015  collecting  information  from  fishing \nvessels, ports, mills and farms to identify where and why forced labour and human rights abuses \nmay be taking place in Thailand. Using the recommendations provided, we published an action \nplan  in  late  2015  for  preventing  unacceptable  practices.  We  also  made  Verité’s  key  findings \npublically available to help wider efforts to stop abuses from taking place.  \n\nWe have made significant progress in implementing our action plan, alongside Vérité, suppliers \nand in partnership with the Government of Thailand.  This includes establishing traceability for \n99% of our seafood supplied from Thailand, a vital step towards verifying employment, living and \nworking conditions on the vessels  used in our supply chain. Progress has also been made in \nproviding training for boat workers, establishing a grievance mechanism for reporting abuses and \nin  funding  a  demonstration  boat  for  training  and  sharing  best  practice  among  boat  owners, \ncaptains and workers.   \n\nWe will continue to provide updates on both our achievements and the challenges in implementing \nour plan.  \n\nAlongside  this,  Nestlé  is  participating  in  an  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  Working \nGroup  to  identify  further  ways  of  improving  general  labour  conditions  in  Thailand’s  seafood \nindustry. This group has developed training guidelines for factories, primary processors and fish \nfarms to help end unfair practices, and tools to support the inspection of fishing vessels to identify \nwhere forced and child labour is taking place.  \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn addition, we have recently joined the Shrimp Sustainable Supply Chain Task Force (SSSCTF), \nan international industry alliance including retailers, manufacturers, governments and NGOs. It is \ntasked with ensuring Thailand’s seafood supply chain is free from illegal and forced labour through \naccountability, verification and transparency.  \n\nWe are firmly opposed to all forms of child exploitation. Our Nestlé Supplier Code and Nestlé \nCorporate  Business  Principles  explicitly  cover  child  labour  and  we  are  taking  action  to \nprogressively eliminate it by assessing individual cases and tackling the root causes.  \n\nThese efforts are part of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan, which aims to improve the lives of cocoa farming \ncommunities  and  the  quality  of  the  cocoa  we  purchase.  In  2014,  we  set  up  our  Child  Labour \nRemediation and Monitoring System (CLMRS) in Côte d’Ivoire. This comprehensive mechanism \nis helping us and our partners, including the Fair Labour Association (FLA) to identify children at \nrisk in each cocoa community and the specific conditions that put them at risk. We then, together \nwith  our  partners,  work  with  individual  households  and  the  community  to  raise  awareness, \naddress  and  prevent  the  problem.  In  2015,  the  CLMRS  was  extended  to  a  further  18  co-\noperatives, taking the total to 40, and will cover all 79 Nestlé Cocoa Plan co-operatives by 2016.  \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first cocoa purchaser to set up such a system to tackle \nchild labour. Creating opportunities for children in cocoa growing communities to attend school is \none of the ways known to help reduce the incidence of child labour. To date, Nestlé has built and \nrefurbished 42 schools in communities most at need. These efforts, which have benefitted more \nthan 11,000 children so far, are part of our ongoing long-term commitment to tackle this issue. \nWe are also working to increase monitoring and accountability throughout  the various tiers of  our \nsupply chain.We provide annual updates on our progress in the Nestlé in Society report and on \nour Nestlé Cocoa Plan website.  \n\nWe are determined to eradicate the problem of child labour in our supply chain and we have made \nthis a priority for our company. We also recognise that the elimination of child labour is a shared \nresponsibility and that we are not able to address its root causes alone. However, through the \nCLMRS, we are able to better understand the extent of the problem and are better positioned to \nwork with the government,  NGOs, international organisations, other businesses, suppliers and \nthe  farmer  communities  themselves  to  make  sustained  progress  in  tackling  this  serious  and \ncomplex issue. \n\nAs a company which sources a significant amount of palm oil from Malaysia, we are concerned \nby serious allegations of labour abuses at plantations.  \n\nNestlé does not source from the region named in recent reports, and neither do we purchase \npalm oil from Felda Global Ventures, the company at the centre of the allegations. However, we \ndo have commercial relationships with suppliers which also operate in these areas and, as such, \nare closely monitoring the situation. We welcome commitments from Felda to act on the findings \nof  an  independent  investigation  into  the  allegations,  carried  out  by  Accreditation  Services \nInternational (ASI) on behalf of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Nestlé supports \nefforts  to  improve  transparency  in  the  palm  oil  supply  chain,  and  we  have  worked  with \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\forganisations including The Forest Trust to monitor and assess our suppliers regarding labour \nand  environmental  issues.  We  will  continue  to  work  proactively  with  our  partners  to  improve \npractices in the palm oil industry. \n\nRegarding the reference to Maggi noodles in India. The trust of our consumers and the safety of \nour products are our first priorities across all the markets in which we operate. In India, we have \nbuilt  a  reputation  for  consistently  delivering  products  that  meet  the  highest  quality  and  safety \nstandards  for  the  103  years  we  have  been  in  the  country  and  the  33  years  we  have  been \nproducing Maggi Noodles.  \n\nNestlé India has always maintained that Maggi Noodles are safe for consumption. Unfortunately, \nand in order to avoid consumer confusion, Nestlé India decided to stop selling Maggi noodles in \nthe country. This withdrawal was also carried out to comply with the recall order made by the \nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). We submitted samples of Maggi Noodles \nfrom more than 800 product batches to an external laboratory for independent analysis for lead. \nWe also tested samples from more than 1,850 batches at our own accredited laboratory. All the \nresults  of  these  internal  and  external  tests  showed  that  lead  levels  were  well  within  the  limits \nspecified by food safety regulations and that Maggi Noodles are safe to eat. Nestlé shared these \nresults with the authorities and the results are also available on our website for consumers. \n\nOn 9 November 2015, Maggi Noodles Masala was re-launched and ever since, the market has \nbeen working to reintroduce the full range of product variants on the market. We appreciate the \npositive  consumer  response to the  return  of Maggi Noodles to the market and  are working to \npromptly reintroduce all of its variants. We remain fully committed to working with the authorities \nto resolve the situation and uphold high quality standards in India. \n\nConsumers  choose  to  buy  bottled  water  because  it  provides  convenient,  healthy,  no-calorie \nhydration.  We  support  consumer  choice  and  encourage  the  consumption  of  water,  whether \nbottled or from the tap, as part of a healthy lifestyle. Bottled water does not compete with tap \nwater as the major source of drinking water for any population. It is also an important source of \ndrinking water when tap water infrastructure is temporarily unavailable, such as in the wake of \nnatural  disasters.  Bottled  water  also  leads  other  packaged  beverage  products  with  respect  to \nenvironmental performance.  \n\nNestlé Waters is a comparatively small water user and is fully committed to responsible water \nmanagement. Nestlé’s group-wide Commitment on Water Stewardship guides our efforts. At each \nof our water bottling operations, we constantly monitor our water draws to ensure that we are not \nnegatively  impacting  local  watersheds  and  aquifers.  Nestlé  Waters  has  improved  water  use \nefficiency in its operations by 20% over the last five years and collaborates with other stakeholders \nto help ensure the long-term sustainability of the watersheds in which we operate.  \n\nAccess to water is a basic human right. All people have the right to clean water to meet their \nhydration and basic hygiene needs. Guidance by the World Health Organization and the United \nNations puts this at 50 to 100 litres of water per person per day. We have explicitly incorporated \nthe recognition of and respect for the human right to water into our Nestlé Corporate Business \nPrinciples. In the Nestlé Water Stewardship Commitment, we commit to ensuring that this right is \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\frespected through measures such as diligence processes to evaluate our potential impact on a \ncommunity’s right to water, as well as the long-term availability of water resources. \n\nWe are proud to be recognised as a leading company in addressing the challenges of climate \nchange  along  our  entire  value  chain.  We  are  among  the  two  top  rated  companies  on  climate \nchange  in  Oxfam’s  Behind  the  Brand  Scorecard  and  we  have  retained  our  industry-leading \nposition in the ‘environmental dimension’ of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Series. In 2015, \nNestlé received an A- leadership score by the CDP Water programme and a score of 100 out of \n100 in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index.  \n\nWe know that based on the available evidence, the food and agriculture sectors will be among \nthose most affected by climate change. We have been following the scientific data for many years \nand in 2001, integrated climate change into our company-wide risk management processes. Our \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  reduction  and  disclosure  practices  have  been  consistently \nrecognised as being among the best in the industry as a result of our actions and forward-looking \nstrategy  for  addressing  climate  change  along  the  value  chain  of  our  products.  We  have  set \nourselves  three  new  objectives  to  reinforce  our  efforts  in  reducing  GHG  emissions  in  our \ndistribution operations and in our major warehouses, and using natural refrigerants in our new \nrefrigerated trucks.  \n\nIn 2015 we invested CHF 289 million in replacing synthetic refrigerants with natural alternatives \nin  our  industrial  refrigeration  systems.  We  have  put  our  full  support  behind  important    multi-\nstakeholder initiatives, including the Paris Pledge  for Action, a  universal climate agreement at \nCOP 21 in Paris, the American Business Act on Climate pledge as well as United Nations Global \nCompact’s “Caring for Climate” initiative, the world’s largest global coalition on climate issues. We \nbelieve meaningful progress on addressing the global challenge of climate change can only be \nachieved through comprehensive, multi-stakeholder efforts. We will continue to actively contribute \nto  such  efforts  and  the  global  dialogue  on  this  important  topic,  while  strengthening  our  public \ncommitments along our value chain and driving industry efforts on climate change. \n\n4"}

Nous avons \nconsulté le rapport du Collectif l’Ethique sur l'Etiquette et souhaitons apporter les précisions \nsuivantes. \n\nPour le Groupe adidas, les aspects financiers de sponsoring n'ont aucune incidence sur la gestion et \nla certification des conditions de travail dans notre supply chain. Et contrairement aux affirmations \ndu rapport de l'ONG, nous estimons respecter notre engagement en faisant preuve de responsabilité \ndans l'approvisionnement de nos produits.  \n\nDe notre point de vue, les déclarations du rapport font des généralités. Les pratiques \nd'approvisionnement et les tendances en matière de confection ne sont guère étayées, sont mal \ninformées et sont donc trompeuses. C'est pourquoi nous souhaitons apporter les clarifications \nsuivantes :  \n\n  La Chine reste un pays d'approvisionnement essentiel pour le Groupe adidas ; elle représente \nla plus grande concentration de sites de production pour notre chaîne d'approvisionnement \nmondiale. En plus des exportations, les opérations de confection chinoises sont également \ndestinées à un marché domestique en pleine croissance, dans un pays qui est désormais la \ndeuxième économie mondiale.  \n\n  Les décisions relatives aux passages de commandes sont complexes. Elles ne dépendent pas \nde la localisation d’un fournisseur dans un pays où les salaires sont les plus bas, mais d'un \nensemble de facteurs : la capacité de production disponible, la capacité d'un fournisseur à \nfabriquer un produit donné, les coûts de fonctionnement et les niveaux de productivité, les \navantages commerciaux pour le pays d'origine, l'accès au marché, la logistique ainsi que \nl'accès aux matériaux.  \n\n  La Lean manufacturing, lorsqu'elle est correctement mise en œuvre, offre aux travailleurs la \npossibilité de gagner des salaires plus élevés (par des programmes de bonus et de primes) \ntout en réduisant leurs horaires de travail. Ce système est généralement bénéfique.  \n\n  L'automatisation de certains processus de production aide en effet à gérer l'augmentation des \nfrais de production, mais l'introduction de la robotique et de technologies similaires dans des \npays tels que la Chine n'est pas uniquement motivée par l'augmentation des coûts des \nmatières et des salaires, mais aussi par le manque de main-d'œuvre. En effet, la prochaine \ngénération de demandeurs d'emploi n’aspire pas à travailler dans des usines, mais préfèrerait \ntrouver un poste dans un secteur des services en pleine croissance.  \n\n  La production automatisée de chaussures récemment lancée en Allemagne par le Groupe \nadidas est appelée une « Speed Factory ». Elle est destinée à répondre aux besoins des \nconsommateurs, par la création rapide de produits personnalisés. En fait, elle rapproche la \nproduction du marché local. Il s'agit d'une approche novatrice, mais elle ne saurait remplacer \ndirectement les processus de production de gros volumes existants dans les principaux pays \nexportateurs en Asie.  \n\n \n\nIl est faux d'affirmer que le droit du travail est plus souple ou que les travailleurs n'ont pas la \npossibilité de gagner des salaires décents en dehors de la Chine, où les politiques \ngouvernementales ont entraîné une augmentation progressive des salaires. Au Cambodge par \nexemple, 80 % des fournisseurs partenaires du Groupe adidas disposent de syndicats \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\findépendants. De plus, les salaires des usines de nos fournisseurs sont supérieurs à l'indice \ndu coût de la vie déterminé par les syndicats locaux. En Indonésie, 90 % de nos fournisseurs \nintègrent un ou plusieurs syndicats au sein de leurs usines de confection et 80 % de ces \nusines disposent d'accords collectifs suite à des négociations avec les syndicats. Au Vietnam, \nil est encourageant de constater que le gouvernement a accepté d'ouvrir la voie aux \norganisations syndicales, dans le cadre de son engagement dans l'accord de partenariat \ntranspacifique.  \n\n  Nous nous préoccupons du bien-être des travailleurs fabriquant nos produits et nous prenons \ndes mesures afin d'augmenter progressivement les rémunérations et d'offrir des salaires \njustes. Ces mesures sont prises en partenariat avec nos fournisseurs et la Fair Labor \nAssociation, un groupe de défense des droits du travail basé aux États-Unis. Sur chaque site \nde production majeur, nous comparons les salaires aux salaires minimums requis par le \ngouvernement, aux normes du secteur et à diverses autres mesures du salaire vital, car nous \nveillons à offrir une rémunération juste à nos travailleurs. Pour plus d'informations à ce sujet, \nveuillez consulter la page suivante : http://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/supply-\nchain/critical-issues-copy/#/fair-wages/ \n\n  Contrairement à ce qui a été affirmé dans le rapport, la falsification des horaires de travail ou \nde la comptabilité des salaires est une exception chez nos fournisseurs clés, qui représentent \nplus de 90 % de notre production mondiale. Nous avons travaillé en étroite collaboration avec \nnos fournisseurs clés afin de supprimer de telles pratiques. Ils sont des partenaires \nstratégiques à long terme et à ce titre, ils sont régulièrement évalués en bonne conformité \nconcernant le paiement approprié et en temps voulu des salaires et bénéfices, y compris la \nrémunération des heures supplémentaires, tout comme les droits aux congés et la couverture \nsociale.  \n\n  Enfin, nous disposons d'une politique et d'une approche bien développées concernant \n\nl'approvisionnement responsable, y compris avec un niveau de commandes visant à équilibrer \nle processus de confection, les approbations d'échanges de journées et un respect strict des \nréglementations, qui contribuent à réduire l'incidence d'un nombre excessif d'heures de \ntravail.  \n\n  Toutes ces réussites substantielles nous ont valu une reconnaissance positive et de bonnes \nnotations de la part de nombreuses parties prenantes.

And contrary to what has been \nstated in the NGO report, we believe we are living up to our commitment to act responsibly in \nsourcing our products.  \n\nThe report makes some general statements about sourcing practices and manufacturing trends \nwhich we feel lack facts, are misinformed and therefore misleading. We would like to offer the \nfollowing points of clarification: \n\n-  China remains a key sourcing country for the adidas Group; it represents the highest \nconcentration of production facilities in our global supply chain. As well as exports, \nmanufacturing operations in China serve the growing domestic market in a country \nwhich is now the world’s second largest economy.  \n\n-  Decisions on where to place orders are complex, they are not based on where one can \nsecure the lowest wages, but on the interplay of available production capacity, the \ntechnical capability of a supplier to make a specific product, operating overheads and \nproductivity levels, trade benefits for the country of origin, market access, logistics, as \nwell as access to materials. \n\n-  Lean manufacturing, when applied correctly, offers workers the prospect of higher \n\nwages (though bonus schemes and incentives) with fewer working hours. It is generally \nbeneficial. \n\n-  Automation of certain production processes does help in managing escalating \n\nproduction costs, but the introduction of robotics and other such technologies in \ncountries such as China is not driven solely by higher materials costs and wages, but by \nlabour shortages; the next generation of job seekers are not looking to work in factories, \nthey would prefer to find employment in the growing service sector.  \n\n-  The automated shoe production which adidas Group recently launched in Germany is \ncalled a “Speed Factory”. It is designed to respond to consumer needs, by creating \nquick-response tailored-made products.  Essentially it brings manufacturing closer to \nthe local market. It is an innovative approach, but it cannot directly displace the high \nvolume production processes that reside in the major exporting countries in Asia.  \nIt is not true that labour rights are fewer, or that workers are deprived of the opportunity \nto secure fair wages outside of China, where state policy has seen a progressive \nincrease in salaries. In Cambodia for instance, 80% of adidas Group’s supplier partners \n\n- \n\n1 \n\n \n \n\fhave independent trade unions and wage levels in our supplier factories exceed the cost \nof living benchmark which has been set by local trade unions. In Indonesia 90% of our \nsuppliers have one or more unions operating in their manufacturing plants and 80% of \nthose unionized factories have collective bargaining agreements in place. And in \nVietnam it is encouraging to see that the government has agreed to open up the space \nfor trade unions, as part of its commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  \n\n-  We are concerned about the welfare of the workers who make our products and we are \ntaking steps to progressively improve compensation levels and deliver a fair wage. We \nare doing so in partnership with our suppliers and with the Fair Labor Association, which \nis a US-based labour advocacy group. In each of our major production locations we are \nbenchmarking wages against government mandated minimum wages, industry norms \nand various living wage measures, as we work towards a fair wage for workers. For \nmore information on this topic please see http://www.adidas-\ngroup.com/en/sustainability/supply-chain/critical-issues-copy/#/fair-wages/  \n\n-  Contrary to what has been stated in the report, falsification of working hours or payroll \nrecords is a rarity in our key suppliers, which account for more than 90% of our global \nproduction. We have worked closely with our key suppliers to eliminate such practices \nand as our long term strategic partners they consistently achieve good compliance in \nterms of the proper and timely payment of wages and benefits, including overtime \npremiums, as well as leave entitlements and social insurance.   \n\n-  Finally, we have a well-developed policy and approach to responsible sourcing including \nlevel loading of orders to balance the flow of production, swap day approvals, and strict \nlegal compliance, which together reduces the incidence of excessive working hours. \n-  All  of  these  substantial  achievements  have resulted  in  positive  recognition  and ratings \nfrom our  many  stakeholders.  See,  for  example, those  listed  on  our  corporate  website: \nhttp://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/managing-sustainability/awards-\nrecognition/ \n\nWe trust these comments are helpful. \n\nSincerely, \n\nWilliam Anderson \nVice President  \nSocial and Environmental Affairs \nAsia Pacific \n\n2"}

We’ve made significant improvements, driving positive \nchange for workers in contract factories and across the industry. We’ve also learned some \nimportant lessons along the way. These lessons have compelled us to invest in making \nsubstantial changes to our manufacturing approach to ensure that it is truly a sustainable \nbusiness.  \n\nWe are transforming our approach to manufacturing because know that when workers are \nvalued, issues of compensation, overtime, workplace conditions and worker engagement will \nfundamentally shift. Compliance with Nike’s Code of Conduct has always been a non-\nnegotiable requirement for our contract factories. We are now focused on working with \nfewer, better factory partners that share our philosophy that valued workers create a \nproductive and sustainable business model.  \n\n  Today, we work with 655 factories, down from 930 in FY11.  \n  86% of our factories currently have achieved a performance rating that demonstrates \n\ntheir commitment to valuing workers and improving environmental standards.  \n\n• We’re committed to reaching 100% by the end of FY20.  \n\nAs our relationship with workers and factories continues to evolve, we remain committed to \nthe power that transparency in our supply chain brings to our role as an industry leader. \n\n• A decade ago, Nike was the first company in our industry to publicly disclose our contract \nfactory base through our Nike Manufacturing Map. \n\n• In 2012, we launched our Sustainable Manufacturing and Sourcing Index (SMSI), an index \nfor measuring contract factory performance that elevates labor and environment standards \nto an equal level with traditional measures of quality, cost and delivery. \n\nWe are investing in working with our factory partners to better engage and value their \nworkers. Since 2012, we have run a number of pilot research programs in four countries \ndedicated to, among other topics, testing leadership mindset and worker engagement, \n\n \n\fcreating new compensation and benefit models for workers, and delivering smartphone \nservices to support and meet the needs of workers. These efforts are aimed at engaging, \nempowering and connecting workers to help make positive changes inside and outside the \nworkplace.  \n\nThese programs are yielding encouraging results: workers report improvements in key \nelements of well-being, including health, financial stability, free time and relationships with \ncontract factory management. However, we know enforcing standards is not enough. In \naddition to Nike’s Code of Conduct standards, we are developing and applying a Lean \nmanagement system across our source base that focuses on new approaches to \nengagement, training, problem solving, communications, compensation and incentives for \nworkers.  \n\nWe are proud of our approach to enforcing standards and incentivizing new business \nmodels. But we know there is still work to be done and we can’t do it alone. Partnerships \nwith governments, NGOs, brands, unions, factory workers and manufacturers are integral to \ndriving long-lasting, systemic change across the industry.  \n\nAs a critical next step, we are advocating for a convergence of compliance standards across \nthe entire industry. By working with partners to harmonize standards, we can raise the bar in \nfar more factories, and ensure far more workers are protected, valued and engaged. We \nstand ready to work with others and share what we have learned and implemented in our \nsource base with the aim of creating a new standard.  \n\nThis commitment to sustainable labor innovation is addressed in depth in our recently \nreleased Sustainable Business Report (see: http://about.nike.com/pages/sustainable-\ninnovation). We invite you to read this report to see how Nike aims to transform \nmanufacturing across our industry. \n\nSincerely, Nike, Inc.”"}

Since the first day, we have been providing human and material resources to aid \nSamarco. However , these expenses did not affect the Vale´s 2015 results, as reported in our \nForm 20 -F. \n\nIt is important to highlight that in Vale’s 2015 20-F there is the following risk factor disclosed to \ninvestors: \n\n“Our obligations under a settlement agreement arising from the failure of Samarco’s \ntailings dam could have a material impact on our financial condition. \n\nSamarco and its shareholders, Vale and BHPB Brasil Ltda. (“BHPB”), a Brazilian subsidiary of \nBHP Billiton plc (“BHP Billiton”), entered into a settlement agreement on March 2, 2016 with \ngovernmental authorities, including the federal Attorney General of Brazil and the two Brazilian \nstates affected by the failure (Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais).

Samarco’s \nmanagement is working on a plan that would permit it to resume operations, but the feasibility, \ntiming and scope of restarting remain uncertain.  If Samarco does not meet its funding \nobligations, each of Vale and BHPB is obligated to provide funding to the foundation in \nproportion to its 50% interest in Samarco.  Vale does not currently expect to record a provision \nin its financial statements in respect of these obligations, but if Samarco is eventually unable to \nresume operations or to meet its funding obligations, Vale could determine that it should \nrecognize a provision. “ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAgreement established between Samarco, Vale e BHP Billiton and Federal, Minas Gerais \nand Espírito Santo governments  \n\nThe Agreement provides for a long-term remedial and compensation framework to address the \nimpacts of the Samarco accident.

Samarco and its shareholders are hopeful that Samarco will be able to resume \noperations and to generate all or a substantial part of the funding required under the agreement. \nTo the extent Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton \nBrasil is liable in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\nThe agreement was ratified by the Federal Court of Brazil, at a conciliation hearing held on May \n5th, at the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nVale’s 4.59% interest in Belo Monte is in line with its strategy to guarantee availability of electric \npower in the long term for its operations and in line with the Brazilian commitment to reduce \ngreenhouse gases emissions. \n\nIn March 2015, Vale transferred its 9% stake in Norte Energia Participações S.A. (the Belo \nMonte hydroelectric power plant) to Aliança Norte Energia Participações (Aliança Norte), a joint \nventure between Vale and Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nVale now indirectly holds a 4.59% interest in Belo Monte, while Cemig GT has a 4.41% stake in \nthe project through Aliança Norte. This reduction in Vale’s interest in Belo Monte is in line with \nits global strategy to focus on its core business, without harming the availability of electric power \nfor its operations. \n\nSince its entry into the Belo Monte project, Vale has hired professionals with extensive \nexperience in the implementation and operation of hydropower projects, especially in studies of \nenvironmental and socioeconomic impacts and indigenous issues. This allows Vale to track and \nverify that these issues are being addressed appropriately, from planning to execution of the \nproject, aiming at positive results and improving the quality and living conditions of the \ncommunities established in the region where the project is being built. \n\nThroughout its development, the plant design was deeply modified in order to restrict the impact \nof the activities on the environment and on the local population. The flooded area was reduced \nby 60 %, compared to the original design. The plant complex, including reservoirs, roads, \ntransmission lines, camps and other auxiliary structures, will occupy 559 Km2. Of this total, 156 \nkm2 (27%) needs to be deforested as the rest of the area consists of the riverbed and non-\nnative vegetation types, such as pastures, cultivated areas, and areas of mineral extraction. \n\nThe Belo Monte project has taken necessary precautions not to flood any indigenous lands and \nto avoid impacts in implementing the construction of sites, access roads, dam and other \nengineering structures needed to build the project. There are also no plans to resettle villages, \nin line with the project’s commitment to reduce its impacts on the surrounding area and local \ncommunities. \n\nDuring its implementation phase, the project is investing around R$4.23 billion in social and \nenvironmental initiatives, of which R$3.74 billion had been spent by March 2016 (88% of the \ntotal planned amount). The remaining disbursement will happen until 2019. \n\nThe management of social and environmental aspects is guided by the Basic Environmental \nPlan, which is being implemented through 117 programs, plans and projects, encompassing \nsocial, indigenous, land-related and physical-biotic investments, aimed at compensating for and \nmitigating the potential impacts identified in the environmental viability studies.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fSocial investments in local municipalities and indigenous communities represent around 60% of \nthe budget, covering social, cultural, economic and infrastructure aspects.  \n\nIn December 2015, about R $ 2.282 billion had been invested in social investments, being R$ \n497.83 million in health and sanitation, R$ 769,81 million in land acquisition and regularization, \nsocial communication, economic recovery for the population, preservation of cultural heritage \nand support for surrounding municipalities. \n\nThe modernization of the infrastructure of the city of Altamira was made, with the construction of \na linear park with 20 hectares, 7 new bridges in concrete and two pedestrian bridges. The entire \ncity waterfront was also revitalized with the construction of artificial beaches and structures for \nmarketing of fish and maintenance of vessels. \n\nWe highlight initiatives to monitor and improve health, education, training, income generation \nand appreciation of cultural and intangible heritage. Of these investments, 108 projects have \nbeen completed to build or renovate schools, benefiting 12,000 students from public education. \n\nIn the health area, 20 new primary health care units and a hospital with 104 beds were built and \nalready delivered to Altamira Prefecture. Until October 2015, R$ 5.220 million had been \ninvested in teams for the implementation of the Family Health Program (PSF). We highlight the \nstrategic investments to reduce cases of malaria in the region, achieving significant results with \nthe reduction of 99.1 % of recorded cases in the period from 2011 to 2015. \n\nIn the area of public safety, US$ 70 million were addressed to infrastructure and equipment \ninvestment through an agreement between Norte Energia and the Secretariat of Public Security \nof the State of Pará. \n\nAs part of social and environmental requirements related to the creation of Belo Monte’s \nreservoir, work is under way to comply with the National Solid Waste Plan, which has involved \nremediating existing dumps, completed in October 2012, and implementing sanitary landfills, in \noperation since early 2013, for the municipalities of Altamira and Vitória do Xingu, benefiting a \npopulation of approximately 120,000 people. \n\nAlso in 2013, work began on building these municipalities’ entire water and sewage systems, \ninvolving investments of around R$500 million and completed in late 2014, significantly \nimproving the way urban waste is disposed of in the region, where conditions used to be much \nworse than in Brazil as a whole. \n\nAs the reservoir is formed, the urban population previously living in areas of “palafitas” (houses \non stilts) in the city of Altamira has being resettled in new neighborhoods. R$ 727.36 million \nwere invested in the construction of five new neighborhoods with all sanitation infrastructure, \neducation and leisure in the city of Altamira, where the families living in the bayous region were \nrelocated.  \n\nThe implementation of the Basic Environmental Plan also involves actions for the physical-\nbioticenvironment, including research, monitoring and environmental conservation activities. \nThese mitigation and compensation initiatives include a Conservation Unit Implementation and \nManagement Action Support Project, an Action Plan to Conserve Endangered and Endemic \nFauna and Flora Species in the Lower and Middle Xingu Region, and an agreement with the \nChico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), encompassing more than 90 \nconservation initiatives. Other notable measures include the implementation of a tree nursery, \nthe restoration of degraded areas, water quality monitoring and control, and encouragement for \nsustainable fishing. \n\nTo meet the commitments provided for in the environmental licenses, the programs defined for \nthe Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous Component (PBA-CI), overseen by the National \nIndian  Foundation (FUNAI), establish thematic areas of activity that consider the indigenous \npeople’s expectations identified in consultation meetings held before the issuing of the \nenvironmental licenses. These programs cover Territorial Management, Special Indigenous \nPeople’s Health, Indigenous People’s School Education, Material and Intangible Cultural \nHeritage, Institutional Strengthening, Reallocation and Resettlement of Indigenous City Dwellers \nin Altamira, Environmental Supervision, Non-Indigenous Communication, and productive \nactivities involving a variety of subsistence and income-generation projects for indigenous \ncommunities.  \n\n \n \n\fThere is also an infrastructure program for villages in the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant’s \narea of influence, involving various works already executed, such as the following: Territorial \nProtection Units to support government actions to monitor indigenous lands; construction of an \nIndian House in Altamira to support indigenous village dwellers who are passing through the \ncity; landing strips to support aeromedical removals; highway renovation and maintenance; \nconstruction of flour mills; installation of a water supply and distribution system in villages \n(including artesian wells); and construction of sewage collection and treatment facilities. Work is \nalso under way to build schools and basic health facilities in the 34 villages located in the \nproject’s area of influence, besides other initiatives contained in the PBA-CI’s Operating Plan. \n\nIn programs for indigenous peoples, of the R $ 463.35 million expected to be invested by the \nend of 2016, more than R$ 287.7 million were already employed in the construction of 711 \nhouses, 34 basic health units , 29 water supplies systems, 21 airstrips and 34 houses for \nproduction of cassava flour in the villages. The Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous \nComponent benefits now about 3 500 indigenous residents of the villages located in the vicinity \nof the project. \n\nDuring the first two years, heavy investment was also made to support indigenous communities \nby donating a wide range of items, such as boats, boat engines, motor-generators, vehicles and \nfuel to support subsistence activities and cultural activities, as well as other items to improve the \npeople’s quality of life. \n\nThe project’s environmental licensing process also required the execution of initiatives to \ncontribute to governmental strategies for the socioeconomic development of the Xingu region. \nTo this end, in partnership with the state and federal governments, we highlight the Xingu \nRegional Sustainable Development Plan (PDRSX), which has a total budget of R$500 million. \nThis plan is aimed at implementing public policies in the following areas: Territorial Ordering and \nLand Use Regularization; Infrastructure; Promotion of Productive Sustainable Activities; Social \nInclusion; and a Management Model for Large Construction Projects. \n\nEnvironmental and social issues, among other strategic topics, are discussed by the \nEnvironmental Advisory Committee, whose members are appointed by Norte Energia’s \nshareholders. Vale, through Aliança Norte, appoints one representative to this committee and a \nrespective alternate member until the end of the Belo Monte hydroelectric project’s \nimplementation phase. Starting from the operational phase, Cemig GT and Vale will then \nalternately appoint their representative every three years. The committee’s main objective is to \nanalyze social and environmental subjects and recommend whether or not to approve \nmeasures to Norte Energia’s Board of Directors, which is composed of 12 members appointed \nby shareholders \n\nThrough Aliança Norte, Vale appoints one member and a respective alternate member to \nNorteEnergia’s Board of Directors, with the right to one vote at meetings, where subjects need \nto be approved by a vote of at least eight members. Vale and Cemig GT alternately appoint \nAliança Norte’s member of the Board of Directors every three years, as determined in Aliança \nNorte’s shareholders agreement. \n\nRegarding the media reports about the corruption scheme related to Belo Monte, as a result of \nthese allegations, Eletrobrás hired specialists to conduct an internal investigation on Norte \nEnergia. To date, there was no conclusive report. \n\nWe emphasize that the acquisition by Vale of stakes in the project occurred in 2011, a year after \nthe auction was done, and when the construction contracts were already signed.  \n\nVale´s administrator’s remuneration  \n\nUnder our bylaws, our shareholders are responsible for establishing the aggregate \ncompensation we pay to the members of our Board of Directors and our Board of Executive \nOfficers, and the Board of Directors allocates the compensation among its members and the \nBoard of Executive Officers. \n\nOur shareholders determine this annual aggregate compensation at the general shareholders’ \nmeeting each year.  In order to establish aggregate director and officer compensation, our \n\n \n \n \n \n\fshareholders usually take into account various factors, which range from attributes, experience \nand skills of our directors and executive officers to the recent performance of our operations.  \nOnce aggregate compensation is established, our Board of Directors is then responsible for \ndistributing such aggregate compensation in compliance with our bylaws among the directors \nand executive officers.  The Executive Development Committee makes recommendations to the \nBoard concerning the annual aggregate compensation of the executive officers.  In addition to \nfixed compensation, our executive officers are also eligible for bonuses and incentive payments. \n\nFixed compensation and in kind benefits include a base salary in cash, paid on a monthly basis, \nreimbursement for certain investments in private pension plans, health care, relocation \nexpenses, life insurance, driver and car expenses. \n\n Variable compensation consists of (i) an annual cash bonus, based on specific targets for each \nexecutive officer, approved by our Board of Directors, and (ii) payments tied to the performance \nof our shares under two programs, the Matching Program and the Performance Shares Units \n(PSU). \n\nProfit Sharing of Vale employees  \n\nThe Profit Sharing of employees is calculated based on individual and team results and on \ncompany's performance, having the cash flow and the spending on current investments as a \ntrigger. This indicator was below the set trigger, so there was no payment of Profit Sharing in \n2016. \n\nThe value of the trigger, measured by the cash generation indicator (Operating Cash Flow \nminus Current Investment), is $ 5.9 billion. As the value obtained was below the trigger, the \nProfit Sharing was zero. \n\nThe current model was created with the aim of strengthening the emphasis on meritocracy and \nmore accurately reflect the company's results. This methodology was negotiated and approved \nby the Unions through Collective Agreements signed in 2014, to take effect in 2014 and 2015. \n\nResources allocated for repairing and compensation of Samarco´s accident \n\nOn March 2nd, 2016, Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco) and its two shareholders, Vale S.A \n(Vale) and BHP Billiton Brasil LTDA (BHPB Brasil), have entered into an agreement with the \nFederal Government, represented by the Attorney General of Brazil, the States of Espírito \nSanto and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities (Brazilian Authorities) for the \nrestoration of the environment and communities affected by the Samarco dam failure on \nNovember 5th, 2015 (“Agreement”).  \n\nThe Agreement establishes the obligation for Samarco, Vale and BHPB to create a private \nfoundation, that will be responsible for implementing about 40 socio-economic and \nenvironmental programs to address the impacts of the accident. The document contains the \nemergency actions that have been conducted by Samarco since November, 2015, and \nproposes mid-term and long-term projects to remediate and compensate the impacts arising \nfrom the dam rupture. \n\nAccording to the Agreement, Samarco shall contribute to the Foundation the total amount of R$ \n4.4 billion, during its first three years, to fund the projects. From 2019 to 2021, annual \ncontributions to the Foundation will be set according to the annual implementation of the \nremaining planned remediation and compensation projects. The annual reference values for \nthese contributions will be between R $ 800 million and R$ 1.6 billion. In the following years, \nSamarco's contribution will be set on amounts sufficient for the execution of the remaining \nprojects of the programs established under the Agreement. To the extent Samarco does not \nmeet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil is liable in proportion to its 50 \nper cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSamarco accident and the Krenak \n\nSince 1997, Vale has established a relationship and support actions with the Indigenous People \nKrenak, when the group had its his territory officially established, boarding 6.5 km along the \nDoce River and the Estrada de Ferro Vitória Minas (EFVM), operated by Vale since 1940. \n\nIn November 2015, Vale started emergency additional support to the Indigenous People Krenak \nfocused on water supply among other inputs in order to minimize the immediate effects resulting \nfrom the Fundão Dam accident. Currently, Samarco is assuming the conduction of the actions \nrelated to the accident. \n\n \n \n \n\fRespostas em português  \n\nCausas do acidente da Samarco \n\nA barragem de Fundão, da mineradora Samarco, se rompeu na tarde de 5 de novembro de \n2015, no município de Mariana, em Minas Gerais, o que resultou no deslocamento de parte dos \nrejeitos de mineração ali depositados e no galgamento da barragem de Santarém. Não é \npossível, neste momento, confirmar as causas do ocorrido.  \n\nA Samarco abriu um canal para o público visando esclarecer, de forma transparente, todos os \ndetalhes sobre o caso. Acesse: http://bit.ly/Samarco. \n\nO acidente da Samarco e os resultados da Vale \n\nComo acionista da Samarco, juntamente com a BHP Billiton, a Vale tem promovido o suporte \ndas ações destinadas a garantir a integridade física, a segurança e os direitos fundamentais \ndas pessoas afetadas pelo acidente. Desde o primeiro dia, disponibilizamos recursos humanos \ne materiais para auxiliar a Samarco. No entanto, estas despesas não afetaram o resultado da \nVale de 2015, conforme informado no Relatório 20-F da companhia. \n\nÉ importante ressaltar que no Relatório 20-F de 2015 da Vale o seguinte risco foi relatado para \nos investidores: \n\n“Nossas obrigações nos termos do contrato de acordo decorrente da ruptura da \nbarragem da Samarco poderão ter um impacto substancial sobre nossa condição \nfinanceira \n\nA Samarco e seus acionistas, Vale e BHPB Brasil Ltda. (“BHPB”), uma subsidiária brasileira da \nBHP Billiton plc (“BHP Billiton”), firmaram um acordo no dia 2 de março de 2016 com órgãos \ngovernamentais, inclusive com a União Federal e com os dois Estados brasileiros afetados \npela ruptura da barragem (Espírito Santo e Minas Gerais). De acordo com o contrato, Samarco, \nVale e BHPB criarão uma fundação para desenvolver e implementar programas de \nrecuperação e compensação em valores substanciais ao longo de muitos anos.”  \n\n“Atualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, Vale e BHPB estarão \nobrigadas a alocar verbas para a fundação, proporcionais às suas respectivas participações \nacionárias de 50% na Samarco. A Vale não espera atualmente registrar uma provisão nas suas \ndemonstrações contábeis com relação a essas obrigações, mas se a Samarco for \neventualmente incapaz de retomar as operações ou cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, \npoderá vir a reconhecer eventual provisão.” \n\nAcordo firmado entre Samarco, Vale e BHP Billiton com a União e os governos de Minas \nGerais e do Espírito Santo  \n\nO acordo prevê ações de reparação e compensação de longo prazo para responder ao impacto \ndo acidente envolvendo a barragem da Samarco. Conforme os seus termos, a Samarco, a Vale \ne a BHP Billiton Brasil irão estabelecer uma fundação privada que será responsável pelo \ndesenvolvimento e execução dos programas ambientais e socioeconômicos de remediação e \ncompensação previstos naquele instrumento. \n\nAtualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. A Samarco e seus acionistas estão esperançosos que a Samarco seja capaz de \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fretomar as operações e gerar a totalidade ou uma parte substancial dos recursos necessários \nao cumprimento do acordo. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de aporte na fundação, \nVale e BHPB estarão obrigadas a alocar verbas para esse fim, proporcionais às suas \nrespectivas participações acionárias de 50% na Samarco.  \n\nO acordo foi homologado pela Justiça Federal brasileira, na audiência de conciliação realizada \nem 05 de maio de 2016 no Tribunal Regional Federal da 1ª Região. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nA participação de 4,59% na Hidrelétrica de Belo Monte é consistente com a nossa estratégia de \ngarantir fornecimento de energia elétrica no longo prazo para nossas operações e alinhada \ncom o compromisso brasileiro de redução de emissões de gases de efeito estufa. Em março de \n2015, a Vale transferiu a sua participação de 9% na Norte Energia Participações S.A (UHE \nBelo Monte) para a empresa Aliança Norte Energia Participações S.A. (Aliança Norte), joint \nventure formada entre a Vale e a Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nAtualmente a Vale detém, de forma indireta, a participação de 4,59% na Norte Energia (UHE \nBelo Monte) e a Cemig GT, por sua vez, detém 4,41% de participação em Belo Monte, através \nda Aliança Norte. Essa redução de participação em Belo Monte está em linha com a estratégia \nglobal da Vale de foco no seu core business, sem comprometer a disponibilidade de energia \npara suas operações. \n\nDesde a sua entrada no projeto de Belo Monte, a Vale contratou profissionais com vasta \nexperiência na implantação e operação de projetos hidrelétricos, especialmente em estudos de \nimpactos ambientais e socioeconômicos e questões indígenas. Isso nos permite acompanhar e \nverificar se esses assuntos estão sendo tratados de forma adequada desde o planejamento até \na execução do projeto, objetivando resultados positivos e a melhoria da qualidade e condição \nde vida das comunidades da região onde o projeto está sendo construído. \n\nAo longo de sua elaboração, o projeto da usina foi profundamente modificado com vistas a \nrestringir os impactos que poderiam acarretar ao meio ambiente e à população da região. A \nárea de inundação foi reduzida em 60% em comparação ao projeto original. O complexo da \nusina, que inclui reservatórios, estradas, linha de transmissão, acampamentos e outras \nestruturas auxiliares, ocupará 559 Km2. Deste total, será necessário desmatar 156 Km2 de \nfloresta (27%), porque o restante da área é composto pelo leito do rio e formações vegetais \nnão-nativas, como pastagens, áreas cultivadas, e áreas de extração mineral. \n\nO projeto de Belo Monte adotou todo o cuidado necessário para não inundar terras indígenas, \ne não ter impacto na implantação de canteiros de obras, pelas estradas de acesso, pela \nbarragem e demais estruturas de engenharia necessárias à construção do empreendimento. \nTampouco há previsão de realocação de aldeias, reafirmando o compromisso do projeto com a \nredução dos impactos sobre a área circundante e comunidades locais. \n\nDurante a fase de implantação, o projeto terá investimentos socioambientais de cerca de R$ \n4,23 bilhões, tendo sido investidos R$ 3,75 bilhões até março de 2016, representando 88% do \nvalor total previsto. Existe a previsão de desembolso do valor restante até 2019, quando se \nfinaliza a montagem das unidades geradoras da Casa de Força principal. A gestão dos \naspectos socioambientais é orientada pelo Plano Básico Ambiental (PBA), que se desdobra em \n117 programas, planos e projetos, englobando investimentos sociais, indígenas, fundiário e \nmeio físico-biótico, visando a compensação e mitigação dos impactos potenciais identificados \nnos estudos de viabilidade ambiental. \n\nOs investimentos sociais para os municípios e comunidades indígenas, localizados na região \ndo empreendimento, representam cerca de 60% do orçamento, englobando aspectos sociais, \nculturais, econômicos e de infraestrutura. Em dezembro de 2015 já haviam sido investidos \ncerca de R$ 2,282 bilhões em investimentos sociais, sendo R$ 497,83 milhões na área de \nsaúde e saneamento, R$ 769,81 milhões em ações de aquisição e regularização fundiária, \ncomunicação social, recomposição econômica para a população e preservação do patrimônio \ncultural e apoio aos municípios do entorno. Houve a modernização da infraestrutura da cidade \nde Altamira com a construção de um parque linear com área de 20 hectares, 7 novas pontes \nem concreto e 2 passarelas para pedestres. Toda a orla da cidade também foi revitalizada com \n\n \n \n \n \n\fa construção de praias artificiais e estruturas para comercialização do pescado e manutenção \ndas embarcações.. \n\nDestacam-se ações de controle e melhoria das condições de saúde, educação, capacitação, \ngeração de renda e valorização do patrimônio histórico cultural e imaterial. Destes \ninvestimentos foram concluídas 108 obras de construção e reforma de escolas, beneficiando \n12 mil alunos da rede pública de educação. Na área de saúde, 20 novas unidades básicas de \nsaúde e um hospital com 104 leitos construídos e já entregues à Prefeitura de Altamira, tendo \nsido investidos até outubro de 2015 R$ 5,220 milhões em equipes para implantação do \nPrograma de Saúde da Família (PSF). Destacam-se na área da saúde os investimentos \nestratégicos para redução dos casos de malária na região, alcançando resultados significativos \ncom a redução de 99,1% dos casos constatados da doença no período de 2011 a 2015. \n\nNa área da segurança pública, foram destinados, desde o início das obras, R$70 milhões em \ninfraestrutura e equipamentos através de convênio firmado entre a Norte Energia e a Secretaria \nde Segurança Pública do Estado do Pará. \n\nDentre as exigências socioambientais para formação do reservatório do aproveitamento \nhidrelétrico Belo Monte está em andamento o atendimento ao Plano Nacional de Resíduos \nSólidos, com a remediação dos atuais lixões, concluídos em outubro de 2012, e a implantação \nde aterros sanitários, em operação desde início de 2013, para os municípios de Altamira e \nVitória do Xingu, beneficiando uma população de aproximadamente 120.000 habitantes. \n\nAinda em 2013, iniciaram as obras de construção de todo o sistema de abastecimento de água \ne esgotamento e tratamento sanitário destes municípios, com investimentos da ordem de R$ \n500 milhões, concluídas no final de 2014, modificando significativamente o panorama atual das \ncondições gerais de destinação final de resíduos urbanos, que apresentam forte desvantagem \nem relação às condições a nível nacional. \n\nPara a formação do reservatório foi efetivada a realocação da população urbana das áreas de \npalafitas da cidade de Altamira, tendo sido investido R$ 727,36 milhões na construção de 5 \nnovos bairros com toda infraestrutura de saneamento, educação e lazer na cidade de Altamira, \n\nonde foram realocadas as famílias moradoras da região dos igarapés. A implantação do Plano \nBásico Ambiental (PBA) desenvolve ainda ações para o meio físico-biótico, com pesquisas, \nmonitoramentos e atividades de conservação ambiental. Dentre estas ações de mitigação e \ncompensação, destacam-se o Projeto de Apoio às Ações de Implantação e Manejo de Unidade \nde Conservação e o Plano de Ação para Conservação das Espécies da Fauna e Flora \nAmeaçadas e Endêmicas na Região do Baixo e Médio Xingu, convênio com o Instituto Chico \nMendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio), onde estão previstas mais de 90 ações \nconservacionistas. Cabe ainda ressaltar a implantação do Viveiro de Mudas, Recuperação de \nÁreas Degradadas, Monitoramento e Controle da Qualidade de Água e Incentivo e Apoio à \nPesca Sustentável. \n\nEm atendimento ao compromisso previsto nas licenças ambientais, os programas definidos \npara o Plano Básico Ambiental - Componente Indígena (PBA-CI), sob a orientação da \nFundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI), estabelecem eixos temáticos de atuação em que foram \nconsideradas as expectativas indígenas identificadas durante as reuniões de consultas prévias \nà emissão das licenças ambientais, incluindo os Programas de Gestão Territorial, Saúde \nEspecial Indígena, Educação Escolar Indígena, Patrimônio Cultural Material e Imaterial, \nFortalecimento Institucional, Realocação e Reassentamento dos Indígenas Citadinos de \nAltamira, Supervisão Ambiental, Comunicação Não Indígena, Programa de atividades \nprodutivas com diversos projetos de subsistência e geração de renda para as comunidades \nindígenas e o Programa de infraestrutura nas aldeias da área de influência da UHE Belo Monte \ncom diversas obras já executadas, como: Unidades de Proteção Territorial em apoio às ações \nde Governo para o monitoramento das terras indígenas, Construção da Casa do Índio em \nAltamira para apoiar os indígenas aldeados em trânsito na cidade, pistas de pouso para apoio \nnas remoções aeromédicas, reformas e manutenções em estradas, construções de casas de \nfarinha, de sistema de abastecimento e distribuição de água nas aldeias (poços artesianos), \ncaptação e tratamento sanitário, entre outras, assim como já em curso a construção de escolas \ne Unidades Básicas de Saúde nas 34 aldeias localizadas na área de influência do \nempreendimento e demais ações contidas no Plano Operativo do PBA do Componente \nIndígena. Em programas para povos indígenas, dos R$ 463,35 milhões previstos para serem \ninvestidos até o final de 2016 já foram empregados mais de R$ 287,7 milhões na construção de \n\n \n \n\f711 casas de moradias, 34 unidades básicas de saúde, 29 sistemas de abastecimentos de \nágua, 21 pistas de pouso e 34 casas para produção de farinha de mandioca nas aldeias. O \nPlano Básico Ambiental Indígena beneficia hoje cerca de 3,5 mil indígenas moradores das \naldeias localizadas no entorno do Projeto Belo Monte e que são atendidos pela Norte Energia. \n\nDurante os 02 primeiros anos houve também um grande investimento em apoio para as \ncomunidades indígenas com a doação de diversos itens como: embarcações, motores \nnáuticos, motores geradores, veículos, combustível em apoio nas suas atividades de \nsubsistência e atividades culturais e demais itens para o melhoramento da qualidade dessa \npopulação. \n\nConsidera-se ainda, no processo de licenciamento ambiental do empreendimento, o \ndesenvolvimento de ações que contribuam com estratégias governamentais para o \ndesenvolvimento socioeconômico da região do Xingu. Nesta direção, em parceria com os \ngovernos Estadual e Federal, destaca-se o Plano de Desenvolvimento Regional Sustentável do \nXingu (PDRSX), com orçamento total de R$ 500 milhões, que objetiva a implementação de \npolíticas públicas com eixos de ação para o Ordenamento Territorial e Regularização Fundiária, \nInfraestrutura, Fomento às Atividades Produtivas Sustentáveis, Inclusão Social e Modelo de \nGestão para Grandes Obras. \n\nAs questões ambientais e sociais, entre outros assuntos estratégicos, são tratadas no Comitê \nConsultivo Ambiental, onde os membros são nomeados por cada acionista. A Vale, através da \nAliança Norte, indica um representante no Comitê Consultivo Ambiental e seu respectivo \nsuplente, sendo essa indicação alternada com a Cemig GT, a partir da fase de operação, a \ncada período de 3 anos. O principal objetivo do Comitê Consultivo Ambiental é analisar as \nquestões socioambientais e recomendar a sua aprovação ou não ao Conselho de \nAdministração. O Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia é formado por 12 membros \nindicados pelos acionistas. A Vale, por sua vez, através da Aliança Norte, indica um membro e \nseu respectivo suplente, com direito a um voto nas reuniões do referido órgão, onde as \nmatérias são aprovadas a partir do voto afirmativo de, pelos menos, 8 membros. Além disso, a \nindicação do membro para o Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia, a ser feita pela \nAliança Norte, é alternada entre Vale e Cemig GT a cada período de 3 anos, conforme definido \nno Acordo de Acionistas da Aliança Norte. \n\nCom relação às notícias veiculadas na mídia sobre esquema de corrupção em Belo Monte, em \nfunção destas, a Eletrobrás contratou especialistas para os trabalhos de investigação na Norte \nEnergia. Nesta data ainda não há um relatório conclusivo emitido. Há expectativa de que o \nrelatório final seja emitido ainda em junho de 2016. \n\nRessaltamos que a aquisição pela Vale de participação no projeto ocorreu em 2011, um ano \napós o leilão, e em um momento em que os contratos do consórcio construtor já estavam \nfirmados. \n\nRemuneração da administração Vale \n\nDe acordo com nosso estatuto social, nossos acionistas são responsáveis por estabelecer a \nremuneração agregada que pagamos aos membros de nosso Conselho de Administração e \nnossa Diretoria, e o Conselho de Administração distribui a remuneração entre seus membros e \na Diretoria. \n\nNossos acionistas determinam esta remuneração agregada anual na assembleia de acionistas \na cada ano. A fim de estabelecer a remuneração agregada do membro do Conselho e do \nDiretor, nossos acionistas geralmente consideram vários fatores, que variam desde atributos, \nexperiência e competências de nossos membros do Conselho e Diretores ao desempenho \nrecente de nossas operações. Uma vez que a remuneração agregada é estabelecida, os \nmembros de nosso Conselho de Administração são, então, responsáveis por distribuir tal \nremuneração agregada, em cumprimento ao nosso estatuto social, entre os membros do \nConselho e Diretores. O Comitê Executivo de Desenvolvimento faz recomendações ao \nConselho a respeito da remuneração agregada anual dos Diretores. Além de uma \nremuneração fixa, nossos Diretores também podem receber pagamentos de bônus e \nincentivos. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fA remuneração fixa e os benefícios em espécie incluem um salário base em dinheiro, pago \nmensalmente, o ressarcimento de certos investimentos em planos de pensão privados, \nserviços de saúde, despesas de transferência, seguro de vida, motorista e despesas com \nautomóvel. \n\nA remuneração variável consiste em (i) uma gratificação anual em dinheiro, baseada nas metas \nespecíficas para cada diretor executivo, aprovada por nosso Conselho de Administração, e (ii) \npagamentos vinculados ao desempenho de nossas ações de acordo com dois programas, o \nPrograma de Matching e as Unidades de Desempenho de Ações (PSU). \n\nParticipação nos lucros e resultados de empregados Vale \n\nA Participação nos Lucros e Resultados (PLR) dos empregados é calculada a partir dos \nresultados do empregado e de sua equipe e do desempenho da empresa, tendo o fluxo de \ncaixa e o gasto em investimentos correntes como gatilho. Esse indicador ficou abaixo do \ngatilho estabelecido, por isso não houve pagamento de PLR em 2016. \n\nO valor do gatilho, medido pelo indicador de Geração de Caixa (Fluxo de Caixa Operacional \nmenos os Investimentos Correntes), é de US$ 5,9 bilhões. Como o valor obtido ficou abaixo do \ngatilho, a PLR ficou em zero. \n\nO atual modelo foi criado com o objetivo de reforçar a ênfase na meritocracia e refletir com \nmaior precisão os resultados da empresa. Este foi aprovado em 2014 e aplicado nos cálculos \nde PLR de 2015. \n\nRecursos alocados para a reparação e compensação do acidente da Samarco  \n\nSamarco,Vale e BHP Billiton assinaram, no dia 02 de março de 2016, um acordo com os \ngovernos Federal, dos Estados de Minas Gerais e do Espírito Santo e outras entidades nos \ntermos do qual foram estabelecidos programas para a adoção de medidas de recuperação \nsocial, ambiental e econômica dos municípios e pessoas atingidas pelo rompimento da \nbarragem de Fundão, ocorrido em 05 de novembro de 2015. \n\nO acordo prevê a criação de uma fundação de direito privado que ficará responsável pela \nimplantação desses programas (cerca de 40), os quais estão reunidos em duas principais \nfrentes de trabalho, uma socioeconômica e outra socioambiental. O documento também elenca \nas ações emergenciais que vêm sendo adotadas pela Samarco desde novembro e propõe \nprojetos de médio e longo prazo a serem implementados para endereçar os impactos do \nacidente. \n\nA Samarco deverá aportar na fundação o total de R$ 4,4 bilhões, durante os três primeiros \nanos, para custear os projetos previstos no acordo.

It is not possible \nat this time to confirm the causes of the accident.  \n\nSamarco opened a channel for the public aiming to clarify, in a transparent manner, all the \ndetails about the case. Access: http://bit.ly/Samarco. \n\nThe Samarco accident and  Vale´s results \n\nAs a shareholder in Samarco, together with BHP Billiton, Vale has been participating actively in \nmeasures to guarantee the safety and the fundamental rights of the people affected by the \naccident. Since the first day, we have been providing human and material resources to aid \nSamarco. However , these expenses did not affect the Vale´s 2015 results, as reported in our \nForm 20 -F. \n\nIt is important to highlight that in Vale’s 2015 20-F there is the following risk factor disclosed to \ninvestors: \n\n“Our obligations under a settlement agreement arising from the failure of Samarco’s \ntailings dam could have a material impact on our financial condition. \n\nSamarco and its shareholders, Vale and BHPB Brasil Ltda. (“BHPB”), a Brazilian subsidiary of \nBHP Billiton plc (“BHP Billiton”), entered into a settlement agreement on March 2, 2016 with \ngovernmental authorities, including the federal Attorney General of Brazil and the two Brazilian \nstates affected by the failure (Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais).  Under the agreement, \nSamarco, Vale and BHPB will create a foundation to develop and implement remediation and \ncompensation programs in substantial amounts over many years.”   \n\n“ Samarco is currently unable to conduct ordinary mining and processing. Samarco’s \nmanagement is working on a plan that would permit it to resume operations, but the feasibility, \ntiming and scope of restarting remain uncertain.  If Samarco does not meet its funding \nobligations, each of Vale and BHPB is obligated to provide funding to the foundation in \nproportion to its 50% interest in Samarco.  Vale does not currently expect to record a provision \nin its financial statements in respect of these obligations, but if Samarco is eventually unable to \nresume operations or to meet its funding obligations, Vale could determine that it should \nrecognize a provision. “ \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAgreement established between Samarco, Vale e BHP Billiton and Federal, Minas Gerais \nand Espírito Santo governments  \n\nThe Agreement provides for a long-term remedial and compensation framework to address the \nimpacts of the Samarco accident. Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil will establish a \nFoundation that will develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs to \nremediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure.  \n\nThe funds to the Foundation will be provided primarily by Samarco. Samarco is currently unable \nto conduct ordinary mining and processing. Samarco management is working on a plan that \nwould permit it to resume operations, but the feasibility, timing and scope of restarting remain \nuncertain.  Samarco and its shareholders are hopeful that Samarco will be able to resume \noperations and to generate all or a substantial part of the funding required under the agreement. \nTo the extent Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton \nBrasil is liable in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\nThe agreement was ratified by the Federal Court of Brazil, at a conciliation hearing held on May \n5th, at the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nVale’s 4.59% interest in Belo Monte is in line with its strategy to guarantee availability of electric \npower in the long term for its operations and in line with the Brazilian commitment to reduce \ngreenhouse gases emissions. \n\nIn March 2015, Vale transferred its 9% stake in Norte Energia Participações S.A. (the Belo \nMonte hydroelectric power plant) to Aliança Norte Energia Participações (Aliança Norte), a joint \nventure between Vale and Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nVale now indirectly holds a 4.59% interest in Belo Monte, while Cemig GT has a 4.41% stake in \nthe project through Aliança Norte. This reduction in Vale’s interest in Belo Monte is in line with \nits global strategy to focus on its core business, without harming the availability of electric power \nfor its operations. \n\nSince its entry into the Belo Monte project, Vale has hired professionals with extensive \nexperience in the implementation and operation of hydropower projects, especially in studies of \nenvironmental and socioeconomic impacts and indigenous issues. This allows Vale to track and \nverify that these issues are being addressed appropriately, from planning to execution of the \nproject, aiming at positive results and improving the quality and living conditions of the \ncommunities established in the region where the project is being built. \n\nThroughout its development, the plant design was deeply modified in order to restrict the impact \nof the activities on the environment and on the local population. The flooded area was reduced \nby 60 %, compared to the original design. The plant complex, including reservoirs, roads, \ntransmission lines, camps and other auxiliary structures, will occupy 559 Km2. Of this total, 156 \nkm2 (27%) needs to be deforested as the rest of the area consists of the riverbed and non-\nnative vegetation types, such as pastures, cultivated areas, and areas of mineral extraction. \n\nThe Belo Monte project has taken necessary precautions not to flood any indigenous lands and \nto avoid impacts in implementing the construction of sites, access roads, dam and other \nengineering structures needed to build the project. There are also no plans to resettle villages, \nin line with the project’s commitment to reduce its impacts on the surrounding area and local \ncommunities. \n\nDuring its implementation phase, the project is investing around R$4.23 billion in social and \nenvironmental initiatives, of which R$3.74 billion had been spent by March 2016 (88% of the \ntotal planned amount). The remaining disbursement will happen until 2019. \n\nThe management of social and environmental aspects is guided by the Basic Environmental \nPlan, which is being implemented through 117 programs, plans and projects, encompassing \nsocial, indigenous, land-related and physical-biotic investments, aimed at compensating for and \nmitigating the potential impacts identified in the environmental viability studies.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fSocial investments in local municipalities and indigenous communities represent around 60% of \nthe budget, covering social, cultural, economic and infrastructure aspects.  \n\nIn December 2015, about R $ 2.282 billion had been invested in social investments, being R$ \n497.83 million in health and sanitation, R$ 769,81 million in land acquisition and regularization, \nsocial communication, economic recovery for the population, preservation of cultural heritage \nand support for surrounding municipalities. \n\nThe modernization of the infrastructure of the city of Altamira was made, with the construction of \na linear park with 20 hectares, 7 new bridges in concrete and two pedestrian bridges. The entire \ncity waterfront was also revitalized with the construction of artificial beaches and structures for \nmarketing of fish and maintenance of vessels. \n\nWe highlight initiatives to monitor and improve health, education, training, income generation \nand appreciation of cultural and intangible heritage. Of these investments, 108 projects have \nbeen completed to build or renovate schools, benefiting 12,000 students from public education. \n\nIn the health area, 20 new primary health care units and a hospital with 104 beds were built and \nalready delivered to Altamira Prefecture. Until October 2015, R$ 5.220 million had been \ninvested in teams for the implementation of the Family Health Program (PSF). We highlight the \nstrategic investments to reduce cases of malaria in the region, achieving significant results with \nthe reduction of 99.1 % of recorded cases in the period from 2011 to 2015. \n\nIn the area of public safety, US$ 70 million were addressed to infrastructure and equipment \ninvestment through an agreement between Norte Energia and the Secretariat of Public Security \nof the State of Pará. \n\nAs part of social and environmental requirements related to the creation of Belo Monte’s \nreservoir, work is under way to comply with the National Solid Waste Plan, which has involved \nremediating existing dumps, completed in October 2012, and implementing sanitary landfills, in \noperation since early 2013, for the municipalities of Altamira and Vitória do Xingu, benefiting a \npopulation of approximately 120,000 people. \n\nAlso in 2013, work began on building these municipalities’ entire water and sewage systems, \ninvolving investments of around R$500 million and completed in late 2014, significantly \nimproving the way urban waste is disposed of in the region, where conditions used to be much \nworse than in Brazil as a whole. \n\nAs the reservoir is formed, the urban population previously living in areas of “palafitas” (houses \non stilts) in the city of Altamira has being resettled in new neighborhoods. R$ 727.36 million \nwere invested in the construction of five new neighborhoods with all sanitation infrastructure, \neducation and leisure in the city of Altamira, where the families living in the bayous region were \nrelocated.  \n\nThe implementation of the Basic Environmental Plan also involves actions for the physical-\nbioticenvironment, including research, monitoring and environmental conservation activities. \nThese mitigation and compensation initiatives include a Conservation Unit Implementation and \nManagement Action Support Project, an Action Plan to Conserve Endangered and Endemic \nFauna and Flora Species in the Lower and Middle Xingu Region, and an agreement with the \nChico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), encompassing more than 90 \nconservation initiatives. Other notable measures include the implementation of a tree nursery, \nthe restoration of degraded areas, water quality monitoring and control, and encouragement for \nsustainable fishing. \n\nTo meet the commitments provided for in the environmental licenses, the programs defined for \nthe Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous Component (PBA-CI), overseen by the National \nIndian  Foundation (FUNAI), establish thematic areas of activity that consider the indigenous \npeople’s expectations identified in consultation meetings held before the issuing of the \nenvironmental licenses. These programs cover Territorial Management, Special Indigenous \nPeople’s Health, Indigenous People’s School Education, Material and Intangible Cultural \nHeritage, Institutional Strengthening, Reallocation and Resettlement of Indigenous City Dwellers \nin Altamira, Environmental Supervision, Non-Indigenous Communication, and productive \nactivities involving a variety of subsistence and income-generation projects for indigenous \ncommunities.  \n\n \n \n\fThere is also an infrastructure program for villages in the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant’s \narea of influence, involving various works already executed, such as the following: Territorial \nProtection Units to support government actions to monitor indigenous lands; construction of an \nIndian House in Altamira to support indigenous village dwellers who are passing through the \ncity; landing strips to support aeromedical removals; highway renovation and maintenance; \nconstruction of flour mills; installation of a water supply and distribution system in villages \n(including artesian wells); and construction of sewage collection and treatment facilities. Work is \nalso under way to build schools and basic health facilities in the 34 villages located in the \nproject’s area of influence, besides other initiatives contained in the PBA-CI’s Operating Plan. \n\nIn programs for indigenous peoples, of the R $ 463.35 million expected to be invested by the \nend of 2016, more than R$ 287.7 million were already employed in the construction of 711 \nhouses, 34 basic health units , 29 water supplies systems, 21 airstrips and 34 houses for \nproduction of cassava flour in the villages. The Basic Environmental Plan – Indigenous \nComponent benefits now about 3 500 indigenous residents of the villages located in the vicinity \nof the project. \n\nDuring the first two years, heavy investment was also made to support indigenous communities \nby donating a wide range of items, such as boats, boat engines, motor-generators, vehicles and \nfuel to support subsistence activities and cultural activities, as well as other items to improve the \npeople’s quality of life. \n\nThe project’s environmental licensing process also required the execution of initiatives to \ncontribute to governmental strategies for the socioeconomic development of the Xingu region. \nTo this end, in partnership with the state and federal governments, we highlight the Xingu \nRegional Sustainable Development Plan (PDRSX), which has a total budget of R$500 million. \nThis plan is aimed at implementing public policies in the following areas: Territorial Ordering and \nLand Use Regularization; Infrastructure; Promotion of Productive Sustainable Activities; Social \nInclusion; and a Management Model for Large Construction Projects. \n\nEnvironmental and social issues, among other strategic topics, are discussed by the \nEnvironmental Advisory Committee, whose members are appointed by Norte Energia’s \nshareholders. Vale, through Aliança Norte, appoints one representative to this committee and a \nrespective alternate member until the end of the Belo Monte hydroelectric project’s \nimplementation phase. Starting from the operational phase, Cemig GT and Vale will then \nalternately appoint their representative every three years. The committee’s main objective is to \nanalyze social and environmental subjects and recommend whether or not to approve \nmeasures to Norte Energia’s Board of Directors, which is composed of 12 members appointed \nby shareholders \n\nThrough Aliança Norte, Vale appoints one member and a respective alternate member to \nNorteEnergia’s Board of Directors, with the right to one vote at meetings, where subjects need \nto be approved by a vote of at least eight members. Vale and Cemig GT alternately appoint \nAliança Norte’s member of the Board of Directors every three years, as determined in Aliança \nNorte’s shareholders agreement. \n\nRegarding the media reports about the corruption scheme related to Belo Monte, as a result of \nthese allegations, Eletrobrás hired specialists to conduct an internal investigation on Norte \nEnergia. To date, there was no conclusive report. \n\nWe emphasize that the acquisition by Vale of stakes in the project occurred in 2011, a year after \nthe auction was done, and when the construction contracts were already signed.  \n\nVale´s administrator’s remuneration  \n\nUnder our bylaws, our shareholders are responsible for establishing the aggregate \ncompensation we pay to the members of our Board of Directors and our Board of Executive \nOfficers, and the Board of Directors allocates the compensation among its members and the \nBoard of Executive Officers. \n\nOur shareholders determine this annual aggregate compensation at the general shareholders’ \nmeeting each year.  In order to establish aggregate director and officer compensation, our \n\n \n \n \n \n\fshareholders usually take into account various factors, which range from attributes, experience \nand skills of our directors and executive officers to the recent performance of our operations.  \nOnce aggregate compensation is established, our Board of Directors is then responsible for \ndistributing such aggregate compensation in compliance with our bylaws among the directors \nand executive officers.  The Executive Development Committee makes recommendations to the \nBoard concerning the annual aggregate compensation of the executive officers.  In addition to \nfixed compensation, our executive officers are also eligible for bonuses and incentive payments. \n\nFixed compensation and in kind benefits include a base salary in cash, paid on a monthly basis, \nreimbursement for certain investments in private pension plans, health care, relocation \nexpenses, life insurance, driver and car expenses. \n\n Variable compensation consists of (i) an annual cash bonus, based on specific targets for each \nexecutive officer, approved by our Board of Directors, and (ii) payments tied to the performance \nof our shares under two programs, the Matching Program and the Performance Shares Units \n(PSU). \n\nProfit Sharing of Vale employees  \n\nThe Profit Sharing of employees is calculated based on individual and team results and on \ncompany's performance, having the cash flow and the spending on current investments as a \ntrigger. This indicator was below the set trigger, so there was no payment of Profit Sharing in \n2016. \n\nThe value of the trigger, measured by the cash generation indicator (Operating Cash Flow \nminus Current Investment), is $ 5.9 billion. As the value obtained was below the trigger, the \nProfit Sharing was zero. \n\nThe current model was created with the aim of strengthening the emphasis on meritocracy and \nmore accurately reflect the company's results. This methodology was negotiated and approved \nby the Unions through Collective Agreements signed in 2014, to take effect in 2014 and 2015. \n\nResources allocated for repairing and compensation of Samarco´s accident \n\nOn March 2nd, 2016, Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco) and its two shareholders, Vale S.A \n(Vale) and BHP Billiton Brasil LTDA (BHPB Brasil), have entered into an agreement with the \nFederal Government, represented by the Attorney General of Brazil, the States of Espírito \nSanto and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities (Brazilian Authorities) for the \nrestoration of the environment and communities affected by the Samarco dam failure on \nNovember 5th, 2015 (“Agreement”).  \n\nThe Agreement establishes the obligation for Samarco, Vale and BHPB to create a private \nfoundation, that will be responsible for implementing about 40 socio-economic and \nenvironmental programs to address the impacts of the accident. The document contains the \nemergency actions that have been conducted by Samarco since November, 2015, and \nproposes mid-term and long-term projects to remediate and compensate the impacts arising \nfrom the dam rupture. \n\nAccording to the Agreement, Samarco shall contribute to the Foundation the total amount of R$ \n4.4 billion, during its first three years, to fund the projects. From 2019 to 2021, annual \ncontributions to the Foundation will be set according to the annual implementation of the \nremaining planned remediation and compensation projects. The annual reference values for \nthese contributions will be between R $ 800 million and R$ 1.6 billion. In the following years, \nSamarco's contribution will be set on amounts sufficient for the execution of the remaining \nprojects of the programs established under the Agreement. To the extent Samarco does not \nmeet its funding obligations, each of Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil is liable in proportion to its 50 \nper cent shareholding in Samarco.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSamarco accident and the Krenak \n\nSince 1997, Vale has established a relationship and support actions with the Indigenous People \nKrenak, when the group had its his territory officially established, boarding 6.5 km along the \nDoce River and the Estrada de Ferro Vitória Minas (EFVM), operated by Vale since 1940. \n\nIn November 2015, Vale started emergency additional support to the Indigenous People Krenak \nfocused on water supply among other inputs in order to minimize the immediate effects resulting \nfrom the Fundão Dam accident. Currently, Samarco is assuming the conduction of the actions \nrelated to the accident. \n\n \n \n \n\fRespostas em português  \n\nCausas do acidente da Samarco \n\nA barragem de Fundão, da mineradora Samarco, se rompeu na tarde de 5 de novembro de \n2015, no município de Mariana, em Minas Gerais, o que resultou no deslocamento de parte dos \nrejeitos de mineração ali depositados e no galgamento da barragem de Santarém. Não é \npossível, neste momento, confirmar as causas do ocorrido.  \n\nA Samarco abriu um canal para o público visando esclarecer, de forma transparente, todos os \ndetalhes sobre o caso. Acesse: http://bit.ly/Samarco. \n\nO acidente da Samarco e os resultados da Vale \n\nComo acionista da Samarco, juntamente com a BHP Billiton, a Vale tem promovido o suporte \ndas ações destinadas a garantir a integridade física, a segurança e os direitos fundamentais \ndas pessoas afetadas pelo acidente. Desde o primeiro dia, disponibilizamos recursos humanos \ne materiais para auxiliar a Samarco. No entanto, estas despesas não afetaram o resultado da \nVale de 2015, conforme informado no Relatório 20-F da companhia. \n\nÉ importante ressaltar que no Relatório 20-F de 2015 da Vale o seguinte risco foi relatado para \nos investidores: \n\n“Nossas obrigações nos termos do contrato de acordo decorrente da ruptura da \nbarragem da Samarco poderão ter um impacto substancial sobre nossa condição \nfinanceira \n\nA Samarco e seus acionistas, Vale e BHPB Brasil Ltda. (“BHPB”), uma subsidiária brasileira da \nBHP Billiton plc (“BHP Billiton”), firmaram um acordo no dia 2 de março de 2016 com órgãos \ngovernamentais, inclusive com a União Federal e com os dois Estados brasileiros afetados \npela ruptura da barragem (Espírito Santo e Minas Gerais). De acordo com o contrato, Samarco, \nVale e BHPB criarão uma fundação para desenvolver e implementar programas de \nrecuperação e compensação em valores substanciais ao longo de muitos anos.”  \n\n“Atualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, Vale e BHPB estarão \nobrigadas a alocar verbas para a fundação, proporcionais às suas respectivas participações \nacionárias de 50% na Samarco. A Vale não espera atualmente registrar uma provisão nas suas \ndemonstrações contábeis com relação a essas obrigações, mas se a Samarco for \neventualmente incapaz de retomar as operações ou cumprir suas obrigações de financiamento, \npoderá vir a reconhecer eventual provisão.” \n\nAcordo firmado entre Samarco, Vale e BHP Billiton com a União e os governos de Minas \nGerais e do Espírito Santo  \n\nO acordo prevê ações de reparação e compensação de longo prazo para responder ao impacto \ndo acidente envolvendo a barragem da Samarco. Conforme os seus termos, a Samarco, a Vale \ne a BHP Billiton Brasil irão estabelecer uma fundação privada que será responsável pelo \ndesenvolvimento e execução dos programas ambientais e socioeconômicos de remediação e \ncompensação previstos naquele instrumento. \n\nAtualmente, a Samarco é incapaz de realizar atividades comuns de mineração e \nbeneficiamento. A administração da Samarco está desenvolvendo um plano que lhe permita \nretomar as operações, mas a possibilidade, a época e o alcance desse reinício permanecem \nincertas. A Samarco e seus acionistas estão esperançosos que a Samarco seja capaz de \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fretomar as operações e gerar a totalidade ou uma parte substancial dos recursos necessários \nao cumprimento do acordo. Se a Samarco não cumprir suas obrigações de aporte na fundação, \nVale e BHPB estarão obrigadas a alocar verbas para esse fim, proporcionais às suas \nrespectivas participações acionárias de 50% na Samarco.  \n\nO acordo foi homologado pela Justiça Federal brasileira, na audiência de conciliação realizada \nem 05 de maio de 2016 no Tribunal Regional Federal da 1ª Região. \n\nBelo Monte \n\nA participação de 4,59% na Hidrelétrica de Belo Monte é consistente com a nossa estratégia de \ngarantir fornecimento de energia elétrica no longo prazo para nossas operações e alinhada \ncom o compromisso brasileiro de redução de emissões de gases de efeito estufa. Em março de \n2015, a Vale transferiu a sua participação de 9% na Norte Energia Participações S.A (UHE \nBelo Monte) para a empresa Aliança Norte Energia Participações S.A. (Aliança Norte), joint \nventure formada entre a Vale e a Cemig Geração e Transmissão S.A. (Cemig GT). \n\nAtualmente a Vale detém, de forma indireta, a participação de 4,59% na Norte Energia (UHE \nBelo Monte) e a Cemig GT, por sua vez, detém 4,41% de participação em Belo Monte, através \nda Aliança Norte. Essa redução de participação em Belo Monte está em linha com a estratégia \nglobal da Vale de foco no seu core business, sem comprometer a disponibilidade de energia \npara suas operações. \n\nDesde a sua entrada no projeto de Belo Monte, a Vale contratou profissionais com vasta \nexperiência na implantação e operação de projetos hidrelétricos, especialmente em estudos de \nimpactos ambientais e socioeconômicos e questões indígenas. Isso nos permite acompanhar e \nverificar se esses assuntos estão sendo tratados de forma adequada desde o planejamento até \na execução do projeto, objetivando resultados positivos e a melhoria da qualidade e condição \nde vida das comunidades da região onde o projeto está sendo construído. \n\nAo longo de sua elaboração, o projeto da usina foi profundamente modificado com vistas a \nrestringir os impactos que poderiam acarretar ao meio ambiente e à população da região. A \nárea de inundação foi reduzida em 60% em comparação ao projeto original. O complexo da \nusina, que inclui reservatórios, estradas, linha de transmissão, acampamentos e outras \nestruturas auxiliares, ocupará 559 Km2. Deste total, será necessário desmatar 156 Km2 de \nfloresta (27%), porque o restante da área é composto pelo leito do rio e formações vegetais \nnão-nativas, como pastagens, áreas cultivadas, e áreas de extração mineral. \n\nO projeto de Belo Monte adotou todo o cuidado necessário para não inundar terras indígenas, \ne não ter impacto na implantação de canteiros de obras, pelas estradas de acesso, pela \nbarragem e demais estruturas de engenharia necessárias à construção do empreendimento. \nTampouco há previsão de realocação de aldeias, reafirmando o compromisso do projeto com a \nredução dos impactos sobre a área circundante e comunidades locais. \n\nDurante a fase de implantação, o projeto terá investimentos socioambientais de cerca de R$ \n4,23 bilhões, tendo sido investidos R$ 3,75 bilhões até março de 2016, representando 88% do \nvalor total previsto. Existe a previsão de desembolso do valor restante até 2019, quando se \nfinaliza a montagem das unidades geradoras da Casa de Força principal. A gestão dos \naspectos socioambientais é orientada pelo Plano Básico Ambiental (PBA), que se desdobra em \n117 programas, planos e projetos, englobando investimentos sociais, indígenas, fundiário e \nmeio físico-biótico, visando a compensação e mitigação dos impactos potenciais identificados \nnos estudos de viabilidade ambiental. \n\nOs investimentos sociais para os municípios e comunidades indígenas, localizados na região \ndo empreendimento, representam cerca de 60% do orçamento, englobando aspectos sociais, \nculturais, econômicos e de infraestrutura. Em dezembro de 2015 já haviam sido investidos \ncerca de R$ 2,282 bilhões em investimentos sociais, sendo R$ 497,83 milhões na área de \nsaúde e saneamento, R$ 769,81 milhões em ações de aquisição e regularização fundiária, \ncomunicação social, recomposição econômica para a população e preservação do patrimônio \ncultural e apoio aos municípios do entorno. Houve a modernização da infraestrutura da cidade \nde Altamira com a construção de um parque linear com área de 20 hectares, 7 novas pontes \nem concreto e 2 passarelas para pedestres. Toda a orla da cidade também foi revitalizada com \n\n \n \n \n \n\fa construção de praias artificiais e estruturas para comercialização do pescado e manutenção \ndas embarcações.. \n\nDestacam-se ações de controle e melhoria das condições de saúde, educação, capacitação, \ngeração de renda e valorização do patrimônio histórico cultural e imaterial. Destes \ninvestimentos foram concluídas 108 obras de construção e reforma de escolas, beneficiando \n12 mil alunos da rede pública de educação. Na área de saúde, 20 novas unidades básicas de \nsaúde e um hospital com 104 leitos construídos e já entregues à Prefeitura de Altamira, tendo \nsido investidos até outubro de 2015 R$ 5,220 milhões em equipes para implantação do \nPrograma de Saúde da Família (PSF). Destacam-se na área da saúde os investimentos \nestratégicos para redução dos casos de malária na região, alcançando resultados significativos \ncom a redução de 99,1% dos casos constatados da doença no período de 2011 a 2015. \n\nNa área da segurança pública, foram destinados, desde o início das obras, R$70 milhões em \ninfraestrutura e equipamentos através de convênio firmado entre a Norte Energia e a Secretaria \nde Segurança Pública do Estado do Pará. \n\nDentre as exigências socioambientais para formação do reservatório do aproveitamento \nhidrelétrico Belo Monte está em andamento o atendimento ao Plano Nacional de Resíduos \nSólidos, com a remediação dos atuais lixões, concluídos em outubro de 2012, e a implantação \nde aterros sanitários, em operação desde início de 2013, para os municípios de Altamira e \nVitória do Xingu, beneficiando uma população de aproximadamente 120.000 habitantes. \n\nAinda em 2013, iniciaram as obras de construção de todo o sistema de abastecimento de água \ne esgotamento e tratamento sanitário destes municípios, com investimentos da ordem de R$ \n500 milhões, concluídas no final de 2014, modificando significativamente o panorama atual das \ncondições gerais de destinação final de resíduos urbanos, que apresentam forte desvantagem \nem relação às condições a nível nacional. \n\nPara a formação do reservatório foi efetivada a realocação da população urbana das áreas de \npalafitas da cidade de Altamira, tendo sido investido R$ 727,36 milhões na construção de 5 \nnovos bairros com toda infraestrutura de saneamento, educação e lazer na cidade de Altamira, \n\nonde foram realocadas as famílias moradoras da região dos igarapés. A implantação do Plano \nBásico Ambiental (PBA) desenvolve ainda ações para o meio físico-biótico, com pesquisas, \nmonitoramentos e atividades de conservação ambiental. Dentre estas ações de mitigação e \ncompensação, destacam-se o Projeto de Apoio às Ações de Implantação e Manejo de Unidade \nde Conservação e o Plano de Ação para Conservação das Espécies da Fauna e Flora \nAmeaçadas e Endêmicas na Região do Baixo e Médio Xingu, convênio com o Instituto Chico \nMendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio), onde estão previstas mais de 90 ações \nconservacionistas. Cabe ainda ressaltar a implantação do Viveiro de Mudas, Recuperação de \nÁreas Degradadas, Monitoramento e Controle da Qualidade de Água e Incentivo e Apoio à \nPesca Sustentável. \n\nEm atendimento ao compromisso previsto nas licenças ambientais, os programas definidos \npara o Plano Básico Ambiental - Componente Indígena (PBA-CI), sob a orientação da \nFundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI), estabelecem eixos temáticos de atuação em que foram \nconsideradas as expectativas indígenas identificadas durante as reuniões de consultas prévias \nà emissão das licenças ambientais, incluindo os Programas de Gestão Territorial, Saúde \nEspecial Indígena, Educação Escolar Indígena, Patrimônio Cultural Material e Imaterial, \nFortalecimento Institucional, Realocação e Reassentamento dos Indígenas Citadinos de \nAltamira, Supervisão Ambiental, Comunicação Não Indígena, Programa de atividades \nprodutivas com diversos projetos de subsistência e geração de renda para as comunidades \nindígenas e o Programa de infraestrutura nas aldeias da área de influência da UHE Belo Monte \ncom diversas obras já executadas, como: Unidades de Proteção Territorial em apoio às ações \nde Governo para o monitoramento das terras indígenas, Construção da Casa do Índio em \nAltamira para apoiar os indígenas aldeados em trânsito na cidade, pistas de pouso para apoio \nnas remoções aeromédicas, reformas e manutenções em estradas, construções de casas de \nfarinha, de sistema de abastecimento e distribuição de água nas aldeias (poços artesianos), \ncaptação e tratamento sanitário, entre outras, assim como já em curso a construção de escolas \ne Unidades Básicas de Saúde nas 34 aldeias localizadas na área de influência do \nempreendimento e demais ações contidas no Plano Operativo do PBA do Componente \nIndígena. Em programas para povos indígenas, dos R$ 463,35 milhões previstos para serem \ninvestidos até o final de 2016 já foram empregados mais de R$ 287,7 milhões na construção de \n\n \n \n\f711 casas de moradias, 34 unidades básicas de saúde, 29 sistemas de abastecimentos de \nágua, 21 pistas de pouso e 34 casas para produção de farinha de mandioca nas aldeias. O \nPlano Básico Ambiental Indígena beneficia hoje cerca de 3,5 mil indígenas moradores das \naldeias localizadas no entorno do Projeto Belo Monte e que são atendidos pela Norte Energia. \n\nDurante os 02 primeiros anos houve também um grande investimento em apoio para as \ncomunidades indígenas com a doação de diversos itens como: embarcações, motores \nnáuticos, motores geradores, veículos, combustível em apoio nas suas atividades de \nsubsistência e atividades culturais e demais itens para o melhoramento da qualidade dessa \npopulação. \n\nConsidera-se ainda, no processo de licenciamento ambiental do empreendimento, o \ndesenvolvimento de ações que contribuam com estratégias governamentais para o \ndesenvolvimento socioeconômico da região do Xingu. Nesta direção, em parceria com os \ngovernos Estadual e Federal, destaca-se o Plano de Desenvolvimento Regional Sustentável do \nXingu (PDRSX), com orçamento total de R$ 500 milhões, que objetiva a implementação de \npolíticas públicas com eixos de ação para o Ordenamento Territorial e Regularização Fundiária, \nInfraestrutura, Fomento às Atividades Produtivas Sustentáveis, Inclusão Social e Modelo de \nGestão para Grandes Obras. \n\nAs questões ambientais e sociais, entre outros assuntos estratégicos, são tratadas no Comitê \nConsultivo Ambiental, onde os membros são nomeados por cada acionista. A Vale, através da \nAliança Norte, indica um representante no Comitê Consultivo Ambiental e seu respectivo \nsuplente, sendo essa indicação alternada com a Cemig GT, a partir da fase de operação, a \ncada período de 3 anos. O principal objetivo do Comitê Consultivo Ambiental é analisar as \nquestões socioambientais e recomendar a sua aprovação ou não ao Conselho de \nAdministração. O Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia é formado por 12 membros \nindicados pelos acionistas. A Vale, por sua vez, através da Aliança Norte, indica um membro e \nseu respectivo suplente, com direito a um voto nas reuniões do referido órgão, onde as \nmatérias são aprovadas a partir do voto afirmativo de, pelos menos, 8 membros. Além disso, a \nindicação do membro para o Conselho de Administração da Norte Energia, a ser feita pela \nAliança Norte, é alternada entre Vale e Cemig GT a cada período de 3 anos, conforme definido \nno Acordo de Acionistas da Aliança Norte. \n\nCom relação às notícias veiculadas na mídia sobre esquema de corrupção em Belo Monte, em \nfunção destas, a Eletrobrás contratou especialistas para os trabalhos de investigação na Norte \nEnergia. Nesta data ainda não há um relatório conclusivo emitido. Há expectativa de que o \nrelatório final seja emitido ainda em junho de 2016. \n\nRessaltamos que a aquisição pela Vale de participação no projeto ocorreu em 2011, um ano \napós o leilão, e em um momento em que os contratos do consórcio construtor já estavam \nfirmados. \n\nRemuneração da administração Vale \n\nDe acordo com nosso estatuto social, nossos acionistas são responsáveis por estabelecer a \nremuneração agregada que pagamos aos membros de nosso Conselho de Administração e \nnossa Diretoria, e o Conselho de Administração distribui a remuneração entre seus membros e \na Diretoria. \n\nNossos acionistas determinam esta remuneração agregada anual na assembleia de acionistas \na cada ano. A fim de estabelecer a remuneração agregada do membro do Conselho e do \nDiretor, nossos acionistas geralmente consideram vários fatores, que variam desde atributos, \nexperiência e competências de nossos membros do Conselho e Diretores ao desempenho \nrecente de nossas operações. Uma vez que a remuneração agregada é estabelecida, os \nmembros de nosso Conselho de Administração são, então, responsáveis por distribuir tal \nremuneração agregada, em cumprimento ao nosso estatuto social, entre os membros do \nConselho e Diretores. O Comitê Executivo de Desenvolvimento faz recomendações ao \nConselho a respeito da remuneração agregada anual dos Diretores. Além de uma \nremuneração fixa, nossos Diretores também podem receber pagamentos de bônus e \nincentivos. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fA remuneração fixa e os benefícios em espécie incluem um salário base em dinheiro, pago \nmensalmente, o ressarcimento de certos investimentos em planos de pensão privados, \nserviços de saúde, despesas de transferência, seguro de vida, motorista e despesas com \nautomóvel. \n\nA remuneração variável consiste em (i) uma gratificação anual em dinheiro, baseada nas metas \nespecíficas para cada diretor executivo, aprovada por nosso Conselho de Administração, e (ii) \npagamentos vinculados ao desempenho de nossas ações de acordo com dois programas, o \nPrograma de Matching e as Unidades de Desempenho de Ações (PSU). \n\nParticipação nos lucros e resultados de empregados Vale \n\nA Participação nos Lucros e Resultados (PLR) dos empregados é calculada a partir dos \nresultados do empregado e de sua equipe e do desempenho da empresa, tendo o fluxo de \ncaixa e o gasto em investimentos correntes como gatilho. Esse indicador ficou abaixo do \ngatilho estabelecido, por isso não houve pagamento de PLR em 2016. \n\nO valor do gatilho, medido pelo indicador de Geração de Caixa (Fluxo de Caixa Operacional \nmenos os Investimentos Correntes), é de US$ 5,9 bilhões. Como o valor obtido ficou abaixo do \ngatilho, a PLR ficou em zero. \n\nO atual modelo foi criado com o objetivo de reforçar a ênfase na meritocracia e refletir com \nmaior precisão os resultados da empresa. Este foi aprovado em 2014 e aplicado nos cálculos \nde PLR de 2015. \n\nRecursos alocados para a reparação e compensação do acidente da Samarco  \n\nSamarco,Vale e BHP Billiton assinaram, no dia 02 de março de 2016, um acordo com os \ngovernos Federal, dos Estados de Minas Gerais e do Espírito Santo e outras entidades nos \ntermos do qual foram estabelecidos programas para a adoção de medidas de recuperação \nsocial, ambiental e econômica dos municípios e pessoas atingidas pelo rompimento da \nbarragem de Fundão, ocorrido em 05 de novembro de 2015. \n\nO acordo prevê a criação de uma fundação de direito privado que ficará responsável pela \nimplantação desses programas (cerca de 40), os quais estão reunidos em duas principais \nfrentes de trabalho, uma socioeconômica e outra socioambiental. O documento também elenca \nas ações emergenciais que vêm sendo adotadas pela Samarco desde novembro e propõe \nprojetos de médio e longo prazo a serem implementados para endereçar os impactos do \nacidente. \n\nA Samarco deverá aportar na fundação o total de R$ 4,4 bilhões, durante os três primeiros \nanos, para custear os projetos previstos no acordo. De 2019 a 2021, as contribuições anuais \npara a fundação serão definidas de acordo com o orçamento anual previsto para os projetos e \nmedidas remanescentes de remediação e compensação. Os valores anuais de referência para \nessas contribuições ficarão entre R$ 800 milhões e R$ 1,6 bilhões. Nos anos seguintes, o \naporte da Samarco deverá ser em patamar suficiente para a execução dos projetos e medidas \nremanescentes dos programas estabelecidos no acordo. \n\nO acidente da Samarco e os Krenak \n\nDesde 1997, a Vale se relaciona e apoia o Povo Indígena Krenak, quando a etnia teve seu \nterritório demarcado, passando a fazer fronteira ao longo de 6,5 km com o Rio Doce e com a \nEstrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM), operada pela Vale desde 1940. \n\nEm novembro de 2015, a Vale entrou com apoio adicional de caráter emergencial ao Povo \nIndígena Krenak, voltado para o abastecimento de água e garantia de insumos para minimizar \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fos efeitos imediatos decorrentes do acidente da barragem do Fundão.  Atualmente, a própria \nSamarco vem assumindo a condução das ações relacionadas ao acidente junto aos Krenak."}

We have, however, addressed the need for improved fire safety...", "response_text": "7 July, 2016 \n\nDear Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, \n\nThank you for providing us with an opportunity to respond to the recent Change Your Shoes \n(CYS) coalition and Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) reports related to the leather and footwear \nindustries.  \n\nPlease see our comments below.  \n\nLeather Tanneries - Trampling Workers Rights Underfoot \n\nThe CYS assessment calls out “the potential lack of transparency of subcontractors and \nupstream suppliers (e.g. tanneries)” as inhibiting adidas Group’s “identification of negative \nimpacts on working conditions and human rights”. This is not wholly correct. All major \ntanneries supplying leather to our footwear operations are well known to us; they are long-term \npartners and are publicly disclosed on our corporate website (see http://www.adidas-\ngroup.com/en/sustainability/supply-chain/supply-chain-structure/). \n\nThe named tanneries are part of our chemical management programme (for wet processes), \nwhich includes occupational safety, and they also fall within our extended supply chain \nprogramme to address Forced Labour, Child Labour and Trafficking; our so-called Modern Day \nSlavery Outreach Programme. Moreover, for many years we have supported the Leather Working \nGroup (LWG), an industry-led environmental stewardship programme for tanneries. The LWG \nrates the environmental performance of tanneries (including traceability of hides back to the \nslaughterhouse) and drives long-term, sustainable improvement. \n\nElsewhere in the report, CYS states that “Adidas to large extent meets its responsibility to \naccount for how negative impacts on labour and human rights have been addressed”, but \nobserves that we should do more to address the negative impacts on human rights in tanneries. \nWe have in place a well-tested human rights due diligence process, one which considers the \nseverity of country and industry-level risks within our global supply chain. The sourcing of raw \nhides and finished leather has already been identified as a priority area for further assessment \nand our deeper involvement. However, CYS’s ambition that adidas Group drives change in the \nindustry as a whole must be tempered by an understanding of our influence. Each year, adidas \nGroup uses less than 0.6% of all leather produced in the world.   \n\nFinally, a minor point of clarification: CYS’s infographic incorrectly states that adidas Group \nmanufactures “footwear and leather” in 1,100 factories in 61 countries. These figures are the \nadidas Group’s total sourcing footprint for all product types, globally.  \n\nadidas Group’s footwear products are supplied by no fewer than 30 factories, the majority of \nwhich are located in Asia.  \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFootwear Manufacturing in Eastern Europe - Labour on a Shoestring \n\nadidas Group is not directly referred to in the Clean Clothes Campaign’s report, but we do agree \nwith CCC that working conditions in Eastern Europe are generally under-reported and \nincreased worker rights protection is called for. More should be done to improve wages and we \nknow, first-hand, that engagement between local suppliers, unions, governments, and buyers \ncan pay dividends and improve the overall lives of workers. Our recent collaboration with other \nsporting goods brands in a shared apparel factory in Georgia is a good illustration of this. The \nbuyers engaged with the unions and government, and working closely with the factory \nmanagement team, secured a higher base wage for workers – well above the state-mandated \nminimum wage.  \n\nWith respect to the general questions posed on footwear production in Eastern Europe we can \nshare the following information:  \n\n  The vast majority of our footwear production takes place in Asia (96%) and in South America \n\n(3%). \n\n  Within Europe, a small amount (less than 1%) of specialty product is made in an adidas-\n\nowned footwear manufacturing plant in Southern Germany and we have recently launched a \nnew, highly innovative and fully automated “speed factory”, which is also located in \nGermany.  \n\n  We do subcontract a small amount of upper stitching to a factory in Bosnia & Herzegovina, \n\nwhich is named in our Tier 2 public disclosure list (see http://www.adidas-\ngroup.com/en/sustainability/supply-chain/supply-chain-structure/). \n\n  The uppers manufacturer is regularly audited for social and environmental compliance, \n\nincluding occupational safety. We have seen no evidence of unpaid overtime or the provision \nof PPE being a problem at this plant. We have, however, addressed the need for improved \nfire safety.  \n\n  With respect to wages, the Bosnia & Herzegovina plant pays above the legal minimum wage \nand provides a bonus scheme to incentive workers and reward productivity.  The base wages \nhave been defined through an official CBA signed between the employer and the employee’s \nWorks Council.  \n\nWe trust these comments are helpful.  \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President  \nSocial and Environmental Affairs \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

They also help to \ncreate stable sourcing markets and sustainable economic growth in these countries. Our \nSustainability Commitment (previously our Code of Conduct) requires that all of our suppliers \nrespect the right to freedom of association. \n\nTo further push the development forward when it comes to social dialogue and industrial relations, \nwe signed a Global Framework Agreement, GFA, with the global trade union IndustriALL and the \nSwedish Trade Union IF Metall in November 2015. The GFA was converted into a permanent \ncollaboration in September 2016. \n\nThe collaboration promotes freedom of association where workers’ representatives have a voice and \nwhere trade unions can negotiate and bargain collectively. The goal is to create a well-functioning \ndialogue between employer and employees at the factories so that conflicts are solved peacefully \nand primarily at the factory level where they arise. We have also launched projects in several \ncountries, including in Bangladesh, aiming at improving social dialogue and industrial relations \nthrough awareness raising and capacity building. \n\nFor more information on how we work on improving industrial relations see our Sustainability \nReport 2016: \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/content/dam/hm/about/documents/en/CSR/2015%20Sustainability%20report/H\nM_SustainabilityReport_2015_final_FullReport_en.pdf \n\nPlease find our answers to your questions here: \n\n1.

In the letter we expressed our shared concern over the detention of individuals with \nunion affiliation and workers’ rights advocates. We requested the government to take steps to \nensure the protection of the workers’ rights, with special attention to the representatives of the \nworkers arrested. We stressed that labour rights related to freedom of association must be fully \nrespected, and that the root cause of the unrest must be addressed through improved industrial \nrelations. \n\nWe remain in continuous dialogue with relevant global and local stakeholders, such as trade \nunions, the industry association BGMEA, other brands, as well as with involved suppliers. We are \ncurrently considering which further appropriate actions are to be taken. \n\n2.  Whether H&M has required their supply chains to reinstate all factory workers suspended or \n\nfired related to the Ashulia protests? \n\nWe closely followed the negotiations between factory management, trade union representatives \nand the industry association Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association \n(BGMEA) regarding the terms for the dismissed workers.

Total's position. \n\nTotal  is  and  acts  in  favor  of financial  transparency.  To  illustrate  this  commitment,  Total  joined \nthe  Extractive  Industry  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI)  from  its  inception,  as  it  believes that this \nvoluntary  and  multi-stakeholder  initiative  is  more  effective  than  reliance  on  more  national \nregulations. \n\nIn 2013,  the  European  Union  issued  a  Directive  (Accounting  Directive  2013/34/EU)  requiring \nEuropean companies active in the extractive industries to  publish an  annual report  on  payments \nmade  to  producing  countries.  Similar  reporting  obligations  currently  exist  in  Canada  and \nNorway. \n\nTotal  considers  that  the  re-introduction  of  Rule  13q-1  under the  Dodd  Frank  Act should  both \nrestore  a  level  playing  field  among  major  publicly-listed  oil  and  gas  companies  and  improve \ntransparency to  help combat global  corruption  and  increase accountability. \n\nTotal  recognizes  that  the  SEC  positively  answers  its  concerns  by  proposing  to  adopt  an \napproach similar to  European transparency legislation. Furthermore,  the SEC's  proposal would \nallow  foreign \nissuers  already  reporting  payments  to  producing  countries  to  meet  the \nrequirements  of  the  commission's  proposed  rules  if the  foreign  rules  were  determined  by  the \ncommission to  be substantially similar to the rule adopted under Section 13(q). \n\nTotal believes equivalency recognition should  help global transparency initiatives evolve toward \nIt \na  common  standard,  thereby  improving  the  quality  and  comparability  of  information. \nencourages  foreign  jurisdictions  that  have  not  yet  adopted  resource  extraction  payment \ndisclosure  laws  to  provide  a  level  of  disclosure  that  is  consistent  with  U.S.  and  EU  rules. \nTherefore, Total considers  it important that the  SEC  substantially adopt  its currently  proposed \nrules in final  form  and, quickly thereafter, unilaterally make a determination of the equivalency of \nEU rules as transposed by the Member States of the European Union into their  national laws. \n\nAdresfce  postale : 2  place Jean Millier - La  Defense 6  - 92078 Paris La  Defense Cedex \nTel. + 33 (0)  1 47 44 45 46 \n\nTOTAL S.A. \nSociete Anonyme au capital de 6  096 470 692,50 euros \nSiege social: 2  place Jean Millier - La  Defense 6  - 92400 Courbevoie - France \n542 051  180 RCS  Nanterre"}

The resource was discovered by BHP Billiton in the 1990s.  \n\nInitial approvals were granted in 2006 for the Haju mine and in 2007 for the Lampunut mine. \n\nIn 2010, a 25 percent interest in IndoMet Coal was sold to Adaro, a subsidiary of the Indonesian listed \nPT Adaro Energy TBK.  BHP Billiton retained 75 percent and held management responsibility. \n\nThe 1mtpa Haju Mine commenced production in August 2015.   \n\nIn parallel with developing and commencing operations at the Haju Mine, BHP Billiton conducted various \nfeasibility  studies  on  the  long-term  investment  and  commercial  viability  of  developing  and  operating \nIndoMet  Coal  which  concluded  that  there  was  not  an  adequate  business  case  to  support  a  major \ndevelopment of IndoMet Coal by BHP Billiton, resulting in the full sale to Adaro.   \n\nBelow we set more details about our approach.   \n\nRisk assessments \n\n \n\n  BHP Billiton adopted a cautious approach to developing IndoMet Coal.  It conducted an extensive \nEnvironment and Social Impact Assessment and separately conducted a High Conservation Value \nassessment, which was used to inform the IndoMet Coal Biodiversity Strategy. \nIn addition, prior to the commencement of the small 1mtpa Haju Mine, a formal Environmental and \nSocial Impact Assessment (AMDAL) process was undertaken consistent with Indonesian law but \nwhich additionally: \no \n\nidentified key environmental and social impacts so that appropriate management and \nmonitoring plans could be developed;  \n\no  engaged NGOs to identify environmental and social impacts and opportunities and, where \n\no \n\npossible, include them in plan development; and  \ninvolved extensive community and government engagement to seek local support and licence \nto operate for the project. \n\n  Additional risk assessments covering various scopes and disciplines (including health, safety, \n\nenvironment and community) were conducted during BHP Billiton’s ownership of IndoMet Coal \nand informed the strategies and controls that were implemented during each project phase.   \n\nConsultation process \n\nA.  Haju and Lampunut:  \n\n  Through BHP Billiton’s Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement, BHP Billiton commits to the 2013 \n\nICMM Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining that sets out standards for engaging \nwith Indigenous Peoples with respect to new operations or major capital projects that are located \non lands traditionally owned by or under customary use of Indigenous Peoples and are likely to \nhave significant adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples. \n\n  The 2013 Position Statement’s requirements apply to new operations or major capital projects for \n\n \n\nwhich permitting and approvals had not commenced prior to May 2015.  \nIn relation to Haju and Lampunut, those projects received the majority of official approvals (for \nexample mining tenure, AMDAL, forestry permits) prior to both the agreement of the  Position \n\nA member of the BHP Billiton Group which is headquartered in Australia, Registered Office: Level 16, 171 Collins Street Melbourne Victoria 3000 Australia, \nABN 49 004 028 077 Registered in Australia \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fStatement by ICMM in 2013 and the effective date of adoption of the Position Statement by ICMM \nMember Companies in May 2015. \n\nB.  Engagement processes adopted at IndoMet Coal: \n\n  Nevertheless, IndoMet Coal worked closely with directly affected villages and had extensive \n\nengagement systems including community consultation workshops and development \nprogrammes. Engagement activities included:  \no  a range of formal community consultation meetings;  \no  close engagement with the Dayak Council (the tribal governing body for local Indigenous \n\ncommunities);  \n\no  extensive and frequent informal engagement with local communities and individuals (including \n\nIndigenous communities);  \n\no  anthropological studies and investigations; \no  between 2012 and 2016, IndoMet Coal conducted 35 formal communication sessions with \n\nlocal communities and 900 informal community meetings; \n\no  environmental and social impact assessments (including the AMDAL process described \n\nabove);  \no \nincorporating community feedback from these consultation processes into project designs;  \no  undertaking cultural heritage clearances (in conjunction with local communities) prior to land \n\no \n\nclearing and construction work;  \nimplementing a range of community development programmes, developed in consultation with \nlocal communities; and  \nimplementation of grievance mechanisms and compensatory action processes.  \n  These communication processes were implemented consistently in the Haju area for over 10 \n\no \n\n \n\nyears. \nIn 2005, IndoMet Coal commissioned a series of community based participatory rural appraisals \nwhich were undertaken by anthropologists and development NGOs.  This process resulted in the \ndevelopment of village based community consultation forums known as HAPAKAT. \n\nC.  Application of the 2013 ICMM Position Statement to future projects within IndoMet Coal: \n\n  Prior to the decision to sell IndoMet Coal, BHP Billiton analysed the 2013 ICMM Position \nStatement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining to assess whether it could be effectively \nimplemented in Indonesia. That analysis showed that significant differences existed between the \n2013 ICMM Position Statement and Indonesia’s regulatory system, where Indigenous Peoples’ \nrights are not based on self-identification and are only enlivened if recognised by the State.  \n  Consistent with implementing the commitments of the ICMM Position Statement, BHP Billiton’s \n\nplan for addressing these differences in future IndoMet Coal projects focused on: \no  Reviewing the community engagement and consensus-building work done by IndoMet Coal to \n\nconsider how it exceeded local requirements and substantially complied with the 2013 ICMM \nPosition Statement commitments. \n\no  Considering any additional steps IndoMet Coal could take (for future projects in Indonesia), \nwhich were identified through further analysis of the 2013 ICMM Position Statement and the \nIndonesian regulatory framework. For example, IndoMet Coal: \n\no \n\ninvestigated the type of consent that it could seek from the Indigenous local \ncommunity in accordance with Dayak traditional law; \n\no  was committed to reviewing its Complaints and Grievance procedure to ensure it was \n\nparticipatory and inclusive for Dayak peoples. \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fMalnutrition in the local community \n\n  At the time BHP Billiton sold its remaining share of IndoMet Coal to Adaro, the total disturbed area \nof the Muara Tuhup Port, Haju Mine and Lampunut early works was approximately 300 hectares.  \n\n  BHP Billiton is not aware of any evidence that the development of IndoMet Coal had caused \n\nmalnutrition in children, by materially decreasing access to food, or that traditional trees for \nmedicine or cultural practices could not be sourced.  \n\n  There are a number of other coal mines in close proximity to the Haju Mine that have disturbed \n\nmuch larger areas of forest.  \n\n  Much of the land area covered by IndoMet Coal’s coal contracts of work were also covered by \nactive timber concessions.  Under the terms of the mining concession IndoMet Coal had no \ncontrol over the activities of the timber concession holders.  \n\nTransfer to Adaro \n\n  BHP Billiton developed IndoMet Coal in line with BHP Billiton’s sustainability values and to \ninternational standards.  This covered exploration, design, construction and operation.   \n  BHP Billiton carried out extensive joint-venture partner due diligence when it sold an initial 25 \n\npercent interest in IndoMet Coal to Adaro in 2010. \n\n  All of the studies, infrastructure designs, procedures and strategies prepared for IndoMet Coal \n\nwere transferred to Adaro.   \n\n  Over 75 percent of the IndoMet Coal workforce who developed and executed these systems \n\ntransitioned to employment with Adaro.   \n\n  We believe we have provided Adaro with the systems and procedures, information, capacity and \n\nexpertise required to enable IndoMet Coal to continue to operate consistently with international \nstandards. \n\n3"}

We believe the \nopposite to be true. We have stepped outside the normal boundaries of what would be expected \nof any buyer to help resolve this case – given the fact that we held no active or ongoing \nrelationship with PDB.  \n\nWe had no orders with PDB at the time the workers went on strike in July 2012, or at the time \nwhen they lost their employment, or at any time thereafter, up until the factory closed in \nJanuary 2014. CCC are fully aware that throughout the period in question the factory was \nmaking products for another sporting goods company, not adidas. Despite this fact, we stepped \nforward, based on our long-standing relationship with the union’s parent federation, to \nencourage an early resolution of the dispute. Those efforts were both extensive, and continuous. \nFor example:  \n\n  We monitored the strike activities and on several occasions GSBI came to our offices to \n\nbrief us on their demands and PDB’s response. Based on those briefings it was reported \nthat PDB had agreed to meet the workers’ demands for full payment of the minimum \nwages, but the factory would not agree to union’s call for reinstatement of Ms Kokom \nKomalawati, whose redundancy case had already been reviewed and dismissed by the \nManpower Department;  \n\n  When the strike continued into its second week, we reached out to PDB and encouraged \nthem to extend the deadline for workers to return to work, i.e. beyond the 7 days’ legal \nlimit, to allow for additional time to resolve the dispute;    \nIn the aftermath of the strike, we consulted with Manpower Department officials, the ILO \nand sought independent advice from an industrial relations lawyer and shared this \nfeedback with both Panarub and GSBI;  \n\n \n\n  We facilitated the appointment of an independent third party, to mediate between the \n\nparties and after that mediation failed, we continue to urge both parties to negotiate and \nreach a mutual agreement to resolve their dispute; and, finally,  \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n\f  We spoke with GSBI on multiple occasions advising them that if they were unable to \n\nsecure a favourable outcome through negotiate with PDB they should to take the case to \ncourt for final resolution.  \n\nAlthough there was no legal impediment placed on GSBI-SBGTS, the union chose not to \nexercise its right to seek a judicial review of the lawfulness of the factory’s decision (to treat \nworkers as having resigned for failure to return to work in due time) and after 2 years of \ninaction those rights lapsed. Instead, the union chose another route to address this issue and in \nFebruary 2015 GSBI lodged a complaint directly with the ILO Committee on Freedom of \nAssociation in Geneva.  \n\nThe ILO Committee has now deliberated and delivered its conclusions and a remedy: it has \ncalled on the Indonesian government to hold a formal inquiry to reach a decision on the legality \nof the strike, based on which the appropriate level of compensation due to the workers can then \nbe determined.  \n\nWe continue to engage with all parties and in recent months we have met with the Indonesian \nMinistry of Manpower on two separate occasions to formally request that they complete an \nindependent review and make a legal determination over the payment of severance. Only a final \nand legally binding decision will resolve these long outstanding claims. \n\nWe would ask your readers view the full statement we have placed on our website, which CCC \nhas also kindly included a link to at the end of their statement.  \n\nSee: https://www.adidas-group.com/media/filer_public/69/1d/691d6520-d1f9-4549-8a94-\n744dc49ab6ca/adidas_response_to_clean_clothes_campaign_open_letter_on_panarub_dwikar\nya.pdf  \n\nFinally, and for clarity, in CCC’s latest posting they have alleged that: “For years prior to the \n2012 strike, the workers at the PDK factory, most of them women, experienced abusive and \nunlawful working conditions ...” We disagree with this very negative portrayal of working \nconditions at PT Panarub Dwikarya Benoa. For the 19 months that adidas held a business \nrelationship with the factory it was subject to regular audit visits and worker interviews. None of \nmonitoring records or worker feedback show any evidence of systematic verbal or physical \nabuse, as alleged by the CCC. \n\nSincerely, \n\nWilliam Anderson \nVice President  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs \nAsia Pacific \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

Our products are made by independent suppliers, based \nin many countries across the world, including several in Europe. Regardless of a supplier’s \ngeographical location, all our 1st tier suppliers (product manufacturers and the processing factories \nsubcontracted by them) must sign our Sustainability Commitment if they want to start or continue \nworking with us. The Sustainability Commitment is shared by all brands within the H&M group, and \namong other areas clearly expresses the fundamental expectations, or minimum requirements, our \nsuppliers need to meet to start or continue doing business with the H&M group. These fundamental \nrequirements include payment of legally required minimum wages, or wages agreed upon in a \ncollective bargaining agreement, whichever is higher. For details please see our Sustainability \nCommitment (wage requirements on page 4): \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/content/dam/hm/about/documents/en/CSR/Sustainability%20Commit\nment/Sustainability%20Commitment_en.pdf \n\nThe Sustainability Commitment is applicable to, and signed by, all H&M suppliers, in Europe as well \nas in other parts of the world. For a full list of our suppliers please see our public supplier list: \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/en/sustainability/downloads-resources/resources/supplier-list.html \n\nOur Sustainability Commitment is complemented by the SIPP, our Supplier Impact Partnership \nProgramme. The Sipp supports suppliers in improving their sustainability performance and helps us \nmonitor and measure suppliers’ compliance against our Sustainability Commitment, including the \nminimum requirements on wages therein. Academics and external stakeholders were widely \nconsulted before launching Sipp. \n\nThrough SIPP we ask our suppliers to self-report data on multiple topics. This data is later validated \nby our developers and capacity plans are set up where needed. Factory performances on \nmanagement systems on social and environmental areas are measured. All factories submit their \nannual performance by filling in the Higg facility module, developed by the Sustainable Apparel \nCoalition, which is one of the largest organisations in the industry, comprising 40% of the retail \nindustry on apparels and footwear. \n\nThis focus on systems and sustainability does not necessarily mean that we are visiting our suppliers \nless frequently, and we still always assure compliance with our minimum requirements, including \nthose on payment on legal wages. However, we focus our resources on visits based on capacity \nbuilding needs and risk assessments. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIf a supplier is found to be violating our minimum requirements we have a system in place that \nenables us to give the appropriate consequences to the supplier. If a supplier is failing to meet our \nminimum requirements we place the factory “on-hold”. The factory then submits an action plan, \nwork on their issues and before they are approved we visit them to make sure they are in \ncompliance. Minimum requirement violations will result in business consequences and repeated \nviolations will result in a termination of the business relationship and phase out of the factory. \n\nAgain, the SIPP assessment method, just as the expectations outlined in our Sustainability \nCommitment, which are measured through SIPP, apply equally to all H&M group’s suppliers \nregardless of where in the world the manufacturing of our products is taking place. This means that a \nsupplier in Bangladesh as well as in Romania, who is found not to be paying legally required wages to \nthe employees, will be subject to above mentioned procedures. For more info on our Sustainability \nCommitment and the SIPP method please see page 99 onwards in our 2016 Sustainability Report: \n\nhttp://sustainability.hm.com/content/dam/hm/about/documents/en/CSR/Report%202016/HM_gro\nup_SustainabilityReport_2016_StandardsAndPolicies_en.pdf \n\nH&M \n\nStockholm, Sweden \n\n2017-12-11"}

Below you will find a brief description of our \ngeneral approach to fair wages - which is the central issue in the CCC report – and an \nexplanation of the wage-setting processes we have pursued in Georgia and the Ukraine.  \n\nGeneral Approach \n\nAt adidas we are committed to ensuring fair labour practices, fair wages and safe and \nenvironmental friendly working conditions throughout our global supply chain. With respect to \nour suppliers, we follow a well-developed and progressive Fair Compensation Strategy.  \n\nOur Fair Compensation Strategy requires that we:  \n\n1.  do not infringe on the rights of workers, their employers and governments to set fair wages \n\nas a minimum;  \n\n2.  conduct due diligence and act when business partners are not compliant with the law or our \n\nWorkplace Standards; and,  \n\n3.  facilitate positive wage progression and fair wages in our supply chain.  \n\nThe idea of a living wage is that workers and their families are able to afford a basic, but decent, \nstandard of living that is considered acceptable by society at its current level of economic \ndevelopment.  Fair compensation goes deeper. It considers the fairness of the wage that a \nworker is paid by benchmarking whether wages: are paid regularly and on time, include the \nlegal minimum, allow decent living standards, reflect a worker’s performance and skills, \nreward overtime, follow price increases paid for the products they are making, are linked to \ntheir employer’s profits and sales, reflect changes in work technology, are negotiated \nindividually or collectively with workers, are clearly and formally communicated to workers. \n\nAs a responsible business, we do not want the workers employed in our supply chain to face \nhardship in their daily lives. Our aspiration, as set out in the core principles of our Workplace \nStandards, is that workers earn enough for their basic needs and also have income remaining to \ncover their discretionary spending as well as savings. We seek business partners who \nprogressively raise employee living standards through improved wage systems, benefits, \nwelfare programmes and other services which enhance quality of life.  \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWages in Eastern Europe \n\nWe have sought to address and improve supplier wages in Eastern Europe through wage \nassessments and in-country collaborations. To illustrate this, we have set out below our \napproach to wage-setting in Ukraine and Georgia; two of the countries highlighted in CCC’s \n‘Made in Europe’ report. \n\nSeveral years ago, a decision was taken to source apparel from Georgia. This triggered a due \ndiligence process, which considered working conditions and wages in the country. Our pre-\nproduction risk assessment flagged that the legal minimum wage had not been updated by the \ngovernment since 1996. That was unacceptable to us and we reached out to other brands \nactively sourcing in Georgia, and to the FLA, to help us define a decent wage for our prospective \nsuppliers. The pool of stakeholders was further expanded to include the American Embassy, \nGeorgian Ministry of Labour, Georgian Ministry of Economics, ILO, and the trade union \nconfederations in the country. The final outcome was the fixing of an industry wage for our \nnewly onboarding suppliers, which was 12 times higher than the government-mandated \nminimum wage. To complement these actions, we also offered guidance to the Ministry of \nLabour on ways to improve the national labour law and provided training to their labour \ninspectors, again in collaboration with ILO, FLA and other leading brands.  \n\nWe have conducted a similar wage benchmarking exercise in the Ukraine. Our focus on wages \nin Ukraine was triggered by the introduction of a new military tax and currency fluctuations \n(primarily devaluation) due to unrest in the country. We reached out to the Ukrainian statistics \noffice to obtain nationwide wage data and, in parallel, conducted wage surveys in each of our \npartner’ factories. From the combined data, we created a wage map. The mapping showed that \nour manufacturing partners were already paying a prevailing industry wage, one that was \nsignificantly higher than the legal minimum wage. The research also confirmed that our \nsuppliers had taken it upon themselves to absorb the costs of a mandatory ‘war tax’ that was \nbeing levied against employees. They did so, to safeguard the workers’ take-home pay.  \n\nWe trust these examples demonstrate the positive approach we take to the question of fair \nwages in our supply chain in Eastern Europe. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President  \nSocial and Environmental Affairs \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

We share the concerns raised in the report and we are sorry if our \nanswers to the organizations behind the report were perceived as too general or brief. We are very \ncommitted to our continuous work both around the labour conditions in textile factories and living \nconditions at hostels, but at the same time aware of and frustrated over that the work to identify, \npush and understand how we and other brands can and should influence to make lasting change is \nnot moving fast enough.  \n\nThe report clearly shows there is a need for improved recruitment processes and a clearer \ncommunication making all inter-state migrant workers understand their rights and responsibilities. \nAnother challenge is the language barrier between workers and management at the workplace, \nmaking the interstate migrant workers more exposed than other workers. We are also aware of the \nvulnerability of textile workers living at hostels. This is the reason why we last year reached out to \nsuppliers in India to reinforce our expectation that the “Guidance for Migrant Women Workers in \nHostels” is followed, developed by the brands group in India (BEWG) together with trade unions, \nNGO’s and manufacturers. The guide aims at providing safe and healthy accommodation to migrant \nworkers. H&M inspects all hostels provided by our suppliers to make sure they meet expected \nstandards. We inspect the premises and conduct interviews with the workers living there. We also \ncheck the buildings from a general building maintenance perspective, the cleanliness of the premises \nas well as what kind of safety restrictions the workers have to comply with. \n\nBut even if the hostels fulfill our requirements as well as national law, there can still be challenges \nthat need to be handled. One such challenge concerns the balance between keeping the workers \nsafe and the freedom of movement. Last year we had discussions with several suppliers and their \nhostels about the curfew restrictions for female workers during their Sunday off and can now see \nchanges taking place. The women now have full freedom to leave hostels as they please during \ndaytime on Sundays, but there will still be checks when coming and going for safety reasons. Since \nthe interview material used in the report refers back to 2016, and activities addressing this have \nbeen performed during 2017, some changes such as this might not have been recognized. \n\nSince we are aware of and concerned by challenges connected to living conditions in the Bangalore \ngarment factory hostels, and working conditions at factories, we will arrange a workshop in the \nbeginning of 2018, together with Ethical Trade Initiative, where the trade unions GLU and GATWU \nalso are invited, to discuss updated and improved hostel guide lines, how to prevent and address \nsexual harassment and the assimilation of interstate migrant workers. One goal is to make sure \nsuppliers provide the migrant workers with supportive services in order to ensure their concerns are \naddressed, both connected to the workplace and the living conditions in general. \n\nSincerely, \nJonah Wigerhäll \nSustainability Business Expert"}

PT Panarub Dwikarya Benoa  (PDB) \n\nThank you for providing adidas with an opportunity to respond to the Clean Clothes Campaign’s (CCC’s) \nrecent press release, announcing its intention to file a complaint against adidas, for an alleged breach of \nthe OECD MNC guidelines and for “failing to provide access to remedy to 327 workers from their \nIndonesian shoe supplier Panarub.”  \n\nWe see no justifiable grounds for such a complaint. Nevertheless, we are happy to share with the NCP \nour efforts and actions to date to seek remedies and to assist the parties resolve their longstanding \ndispute. Those efforts are well documented and have featured in past responses posted on the BHRRC \nsite, in statements published on our corporate website (see, for instance, our lengthy statement at:  \nhttps://www.adidas-group.com/media/filer_public/69/1d/691d6520-d1f9-4549-8a94-\n744dc49ab6ca/adidas_response_to_clean_clothes_campaign_open_letter_on_panarub_dwikarya.pdf) \nand in correspondence with the CCC. \n\nThe NCP complaint repeats an earlier claim by CCC (dating from September 2017) that adidas had \nneglected its responsibility to address human rights violations in this case or to create the necessary \nleverage to resolve this long-standing dispute. We believe the opposite to be true. We have stepped \noutside the normal boundaries of what would be expected of any buyer to help resolve this case – given \nthat we held no active or ongoing relationship with PDB, which had operated as a subcontractor to our \nmain shoe manufacturing partner, PT Panarub.  \n\nWe had no orders with PDB at the time the workers went on strike in July 2012, or at the time when they \nlost their employment, or at any time thereafter, up until the factory closed in January, 2014. CCC are \nfully aware that throughout the period in question the factory was making products for another sporting \ngoods company, not adidas. Despite this fact, we stepped forward, based on our long-standing \nrelationship with the union’s parent federation, to encourage an early resolution of the dispute. Those \nefforts were both extensive, and continuous.  \n\nFor example:  \n\n-  We monitored the strike activities and on several occasions GSBI came to our offices to brief us \n\non their demands and PDB’s response. Based on those briefings it was reported that PDB had \nagreed to meet the workers’ demands for full payment of the arrears in the minimum wages to \nworkers, but the factory would not agree to union’s call for reinstatement of Ms. Kokom \nKomalawati, whose redundancy case had already been reviewed and found lawful by the \nManpower Department;  \n\n-  When the strike continued into its second week, we reached out to PDB and encouraged them to \nextend the deadline for workers to return to work, i.e. beyond the 7 days’ legal limit, to allow for \nadditional time to resolve the dispute;  \n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f- \n\nIn the aftermath of the strike, we consulted with Manpower Department officials, the ILO and \nsought independent advice from an industrial relations lawyer and shared this feedback with both \nPanarub and GSBI;  \n\n-  We facilitated the appointment of an independent third party, to mediate between the parties and \nafter that mediation failed, we continue to urge both parties to negotiate and reach a mutual \nagreement to resolve their dispute; and, finally,  \n\n-  We spoke with GSBI on multiple occasions advising them that if they were unable to secure a \n\nfavourable outcome through negotiations with PDB they should to take the case to court for final \nresolution.  \n\nAlthough there was no legal impediment placed on GSBI-SBGTS, the union chose not to exercise its right \nto seek a judicial review of the lawfulness of the factory’s decision (to treat workers as having resigned \nfor failure to return to work in due time) and after 2 years of inaction those rights lapsed. Instead, the \nunion chose another route to address this issue and in February 2015 GSBI lodged a complaint directly \nwith the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in Geneva.  \n\nThe ILO Committee has now deliberated and delivered its conclusions and a remedy: it has called on the \nIndonesian government to hold a formal inquiry to reach a decision on the legality of the strike, based on \nwhich the appropriate level of compensation due to the workers can then be determined.  Since April, \n2017 we have met with the Indonesian Ministry of Manpower on three separate occasions and have also \nwritten to them, formally, to request that they complete an independent review and make a legal \ndetermination over the payment of severance. It is our belief, that only a final and legally binding decision \nwill resolve these long outstanding claims.  \n\nThe two parties involved in this case have remained polarized and largely unyielding, despite adidas’ early \nintervention, our facilitation of a mediation process immediately after the strike, and our engagement in \nthe years that have followed. We are now placing our trust in the Indonesian Ministry of Manpower to act \non the ILO’s recommendations and for the sake of the workers, and their long overdue payments, to \ndefine a settlement package that is acceptable to both Panarub and the union. We understand that in the \ncoming week the Indonesian government will meet with the ILO in Geneva to further discuss this case and \nprogress towards a final resolution. \n\nSincerely,  \n\nWilliam Anderson  \nVice President  \nSocial & Environmental Affairs  \nAsia Pacific \n\nPage 2 of 2"}

Im Februar 2017 hat der Branchenzusammenschluss eine Initiative zu Rohmateria-\n\nlien  mit  Nachhaltigkeitsrisiken  gestartet.  Dabei  soll  die  Einhaltung  von  Nachhaltigkeitsstan-\n\ndards  in  der  Vorlieferkette  geprüft  werden.  Ein  erster  Schritt  wird  in  der  Definition  von  kriti-\n\n1 \n\n \n \n\fschen  Rohmaterialien  in  der Automobilindustrie  liegen,  die  im  Rahmen  einer Studie im Juni \n\n2018 veröffentlicht werden. \n\nBei identifizierten Risiken gehen wir jedem Verdachtsfall konsequent nach. Hierzu hat Volks-\n\nwagen  unter  anderem  in  2017  seine  Leitlinie  zu  einem  nachhaltigen  Rohstoffbezug  aktuali-\n\nsiert  und  beschreibt  hier  unter  anderem  seine  Erwartungen  an  seine  Lieferanten bei mögli-\n\nchen Verdachtsfällen für Menschenrechtsverstöße.  \n\nWeiterhin  arbeiten  als  wir  kontinuierlich an der Implementierung der fünf Schritte der OECD \n\nDue  Diligence  Guidance  for  Responsible  Supply  Chains  of  Minerals  from  Conflict-Affected \n\nand  High-Risk  Areas  und  sind  zurzeit  dabei,  unsere  strategischen  Maßnahmen  um  unsere \n\nAktivitäten  in der Lieferkette auszuweiten.  \n\nPlatinabbau Südafrika  \n\nDie  Geschehnisse  vom 16.

Wir  stehen  in  engem \n\nund  kontinuierlichem  Austausch mit unseren Lieferanten und lassen uns von den Fortschrit-\n\nten  vor  Ort  bei  der  Umsetzung  der  vereinbarten  Maßnahmen  informieren.  Zu  den  ergriffe-\n\nnen/vereinbarten  Maßnahmen  gehörten unter anderem:  \n\n-  Mehrfache  Nachhaltigkeitsauditierungen  und  Überprüfung  der  installierten  Prozesse  mit \n\ndem  Schwerpunkt  Arbeitsstandards  und  Menschenrechte  durch  unabhängige  externe  Audi-\n\ntoren in den Minen  inkl. Maßnahmenpläne   \n\n-  regelmäßiger  Austausch  zwischen  Volkswagen/Konzernmarken  und  seinen  Lieferanten \n\nsowie  Austausch/Fortschrittsüberprüfung  zwischen  VW-Lieferanten  und  den  Minenunter-\n\nnehmen  \n\n-  Engagement  unserer  Lieferanten  im  Verband  „International  Platinum  Association“,  um  die \n\nSituation im Platingürtel in Südafrika zu verbessern  \n\n- Kontinuierliche Fortführung des Wohnungsbaus für die Minenmitarbeiter   \n\n2 \n\n \n \n\fWir  waren  zudem  selbst  mehrfach  mit Mitarbeitern des Volkswagen Konzerns in Südafrika, \n\num  uns  von  der  Situation  vor  Ort  in  der Minenindustrie (zuletzt August 2017) und dem Um-\n\nsetzungsstand  ein  Bild  zu  machen  und haben uns zudem an einem Stakeholder-Dialog mit \n\nLonmin  und  BASF  zum  Thema  „Quality  of  Life  and  Social  Stability on the Western Limb of \n\nPlatinum Belt“ beteiligt.   \n\nUnabhängig  von  den  Aktivitäten  im  Bereich  des  Rohstoffsektors  verfolgt  Volkswagen  die \n\nStrategie,  einen  möglichst  großen  Anteil  der  Platingruppenmetalle  für  den  eigenen  Bedarf \n\naus  Recyclingmaterial  zu  gewinnen.

We always appreciate stakeholders clearly communicating their \nconcerns and expectations on us, and we trust below will provide you confidence that we remain \ncommitted to our vision of a fair living wage.  \n\nBack in 2013, when our Fair Living Wage strategy was launched, our vision clearly stated: \n“Even though our strategy initially focuses on the suppliers we work with, we want to see change \nthroughout the industry; all workers at textile factories, regardless of who is the buyer, should earn a \nfair living wage”.  \n\nIn this we share the same ambition. However, as we are sure you are also aware from our previous \nconversations, our understanding of the best approach by which to achieve a fair living wage is \nsomewhat different. We developed our strategy in consultation with key stakeholders such as the \nILO and the global trade union organisation IndustriALL, and in response to your 2nd and 3rd point the \nconclusion of these consultations - that informed our strategy - was that as living wage is an industry-\nwide issue joint solution negotiated by the actors in the industry in a country have the greatest \npotential to stand the test of time and to be enforced in practice than any top down or single brand \nsolution from afar. H&M group has a clear role to play to facilitate the payment of living wages, but \nwe have always been clear that there are many factors beyond our control involved and that we \ndepend on shared responsibility for the vision to be achieved.  \n\nThis said, we have a unique position and a responsibility through our size and scale to influence \nchange on factory, industry and country level. Our fair living wage strategy was developed with this \nin mind and focus on different areas and levels: \n\n1.  We train workers and management about their rights and responsibilities through our workplace \ndialogue programmes and facilitate democratic elections of worker representatives. We promote \nwell-functioning workplace dialogue and industrial relations. These efforts are important for \nworkers themselves to be empowered to take responsibility for improved working conditions, \nincluding wages. \n\n2.  We engage with factory owners directly to help them implement well-functioning wage \n\nmanagement systems at the factories. Simply put, the new wage system differentiates individual \nwages on the basis of skills, responsibility and experience, and provide to the workers a fair, \nprogressive and transparent wage setting mechanism. The wage grid encourages skill \ndevelopment and make the employers aware that wages that are higher and differentiated can \ncontribute to retention, productivity and a better collaborative culture. To avoid any \nmisunderstanding, improved wage management system doesn’t mean that workers get a living \nwage after implementation, but factories that have implemented the new system tend to \nprovide higher wages to those who haven’t as of yet gone through the programme. Most \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fimportantly though - it helps change mindset from seeing wages purely as a cost and it lays the \nfoundation for informed wage negotiations.  \n\n3.  We ensure that we maintain good purchasing practices and aim for direct, long-term and stable \nbusiness relationships with our suppliers. Good purchasing practices facilitate living wages to be \npaid (see also the section on ACT). We have our own sourcing staff in each production country \nsince many years back which helps good communication and continuous improvements on our \npart. \n\n4.  To be able to bring about change across the industry, we collaborate with experts, NGOs, unions \nand other brands, for example through our partnership within the groundbreaking ACT platform, \nour Global Framework Agreement (GFA) with IndustriALL, and various collaboration projects. The \nGFA helps to build trust between the social partners as well as capacity of local unions and \nemployers, and ACT works towards facilitating industry-wide collective bargaining agreements to \nincrease wages and improve working conditions facilitated by purchasing practices. \n\n5.  We engage in dialogue with local governments to further develop the legal framework needed \nfor improved industrial relations, including enabling freedom of association and collective \nbargaining agreements. \n\nEven if we cannot decide directly what workers are paid at our suppliers’ factories, we can support \nthe foundation for a fair living wage to be paid, collaborate with others to drive change on industry \nlevel and advocate for enabling country frameworks. This is important to us and we remain \ncommitted to drive this agenda forward – during 2018 and beyond. \n\nThe first milestone of our Fair Living Wage roadmap is to “establish the foundation and mechanism to \nenable for fair living wages to be paid”. Our goal for 2018 is that a majority of our suppliers’ factories \n(representing 50% of our product volume) should have democratically elected worker \nrepresentatives in place, as well as progressive and transparent wage systems ensuring that the \nwages take the worker’s skills, experience, performance and responsibility into account. The size and \nreach of our ambition is the same as in 2013 when we launched our roadmap. We also had as a goal \nthat 90% of our suppliers should consider H&M group as a fair business partner.  \n\nWhen summarizing 2017, we can conclude that two of these goals are already met and we \nare  progressing according to plan to also secure functional wage management systems covering \n50% of our product volume.  Furthermore, we have made good progress in collaboration with others \non industry and country level. \n\nThe need to secure a fair living wage to the workers in our supply chain, and the global garment \nindustry in general, is without doubt one of the most pressing social issues we are facing today. It is \nan issue shared by the industry, and which requires the contribution of all concerned stakeholders if \nwe are to realize a sustainable solution. Brands like H&M clearly has a crucial role to play, but of \nequal importance are also trade unions, suppliers, and governments in sourcing markets. This is why \nwe have formed partnerships and entered into agreements with others, which will enable us to fulfil \nour commitments.  \n\nKey among these collaborative efforts is the work being undertaken within ACT (Action Collaboration \nTransformation), a partnership where H&M, IndustriALL Global Union, and a number of other leading \nbrands and retailers have come together behind a commitment to achieve living wages in the \ngarment industry through industry-wide collective bargaining facilitated by purchasing practices. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fTo reply to your 4th point, we would like to provide some additional information about ACT. H&M, in \njoining the ACT partnership in 2014, clearly expressed our commitment to enable freedom of \nassociation, collective bargaining and living wages in the global garment supply chains. The \nagreement we signed sets out our commitment not only as to how a living wage should be \nunderstood, but also on how to achieve it. It also reinforces our belief in developing mature \nindustrial relations and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements, negotiated by national trade \nunions and suppliers. \n\nFurthermore, we clearly recognize the importance of a joint approach between global brands, \nsuppliers and global unions and their national affiliates, to create industry-wide agreements that are \nregistered and legally enforceable under law. ACT provides a framework for action that all members \nagree to implement, and we believe that solutions negotiated by the actors in the industry have the \ngreatest potential to reflect the needs and possibilities of the industry. Change on industry level can \nonly be effective if global brands and retailers join together to promote what John Ruggie terms \n“collective action to leverage change.” In a letter to Guy Ryder in 2016 he wrote that “ the \nBangladesh Accord and the ACT initiative are two such instances that illustrate the promise of \ncollective action to leverage change. Importantly, these initiatives are not just about voluntary \nphilanthropic contributions to development, but also a product of a recognized responsibility of \ncompanies to address severe human rights risks in their supply chains. In doing so, these initiatives \nmake a critical contribution to sustainable development.” Since then additional endorsement has \ncome also from the G20 Labour and Employment Ministers Meeting 2017. \n\nAs a member of ACT, H&M has committed to working towards this goal through efforts within \nseveral areas, including: \n\n• \n\n• \n\nIndustry-wide collective bargaining: collective bargaining at an industry level is the missing \nmechanism which will enable significant progress to be made towards achieving a living wage for \ngarment workers. Its absence from the garment industry today is the main obstacle to achieving \nhigher wages. Without industry-wide collective bargaining, the current structural barriers within \nglobal supply chains make a single brand solution to living wages impossible. ACT is currently \noperating in several sourcing markets, and we believe that, if the results will be in line with our \nexpectations, the number of workers that will benefit from it will be substantial, contributing to \nmake a real change. \nImproving purchasing practices: the ACT process creates a framework for brands, together with \nIndustriALL, to identify which purchasing practices have the greatest impact on wages and \nworking conditions. As a member of ACT, we are in the process of adopting common \ncommitments on purchasing practices. We would like also to point out, to reply to your 5th point, \nthat we adopt an open costing system, which allows us to keep the cost of the wages separated \nin the negotiations.  \n\nAs we have previously seen with the Bangladesh Accord, the ACT initiative must grow to include \nmore global brands and retailers. We keep encouraging brands who are not yet members of ACT to \nsimilarly join our efforts in taking collective action to leverage change in the garment industry, and \nwe engage with key stakeholders to support the initiative.  \nAs always, we appreciate you reaching out to us. Clean Clothes Campaign was one of the \nstakeholders we consulted when forming our strategy and we value the dialogue. Despite our \ndifferences in how we view what drives progress towards living wages, we share the same ambition. \n\nWhen we launched our strategy, we didn’t have a clear view on how to exactly reach our vision even \nthough we had identified a few measurable goals and we were aware that we would have successes \nas well as failures along the way, and that we also depend on other actors for systemic change. But \n\n \n \n \n \n\fmost importantly we knew where we want the industry to go. We have made a lot of important \nlearnings, seen great progress and we stay committed. Being bold and outspoken with a vision is \nneeded if one seeks for more than incremental change and for new ways of working and \ncollaborations to form.  \n\nThe steps forward and positive results during 2017, as well as our continued collaborations with \nhighly appreciated partners and peers, combined with exchange of perspectives with various \nstakeholders inspire us to continue our challenging work within our Fair Living Wage strategy - during \n2018 and beyond.  \n\nKind regards, \nAnna Gedda"}

We also hope the next lines will  help \nFacing Finance understand how Vale has responded to the emergency and continues to monitor \nand  support  all  human  rights  remedy  processes  and  environmental  recovery  of  the  Samarco \naccident. \n\nVale recognizes there is still room for improvement, and is dedicated to achieving higher levels \nof  performance.  Nevertheless,  much  has  been  already  achieved  and  should  not  be  so  easily \ndisregarded. \n\nVale S.A. – The company \n\nVale  S.A.  is  the  largest  mining  company  in  the  Americas  and  one  of  the  largest  in  the  world, \nleading  the  global  marked  in  iron  ore,  iron  ore  pellets,  and  nickel.  It  is  also  dedicated  to  the \nproduction of manganese, other non-ferrous minerals and fertilizers. With this portfolio, it operates \nin 26 countries on five continents, relying on robust logistics systems. Through its affiliates and \njoint ventures, or directly, it holds relevant investments in the energy and steel industries. In 2016, \nwith a workforce of 139.7 thousand, of which 109.5 thousand are located in Brazil, Vale totaled \nUS$24.3 billion in  distributed  economic value, aligned  with its vocation of transforming natural \nthe  company,  please  check: \nresources \nhttp://www.vale.com/EN/investors/company/fact-sheet/Pages/default.aspx  . \n\ninto  wealth.  For  more \n\ninformation  on \n\nVale recognizes that in its activities, due to the characteristics of the extractive sector, there are \nnumerous challenges regarding environmental and social aspects. That is why the company is \ncommitted  to  maintaining  a  transparent  dialogue  with  its  stakeholders,  invest  in  training, \ntechnology, innovation, risk and impact management focusing on continuous improvement.   \n\nVale  is  a  world  class  mining  company  that  adopts  international  and  national  social  and \nenvironmental  standards  to  conduct  its  businesses  and  is  committed  with  sustainability  of  its \noperations and the sustainable development of the communities and regions where it operates.  \n\nLa Morada, Peru \n\nVale concluded by the end of the second semester the process of devolution of this area to the \nGovernment of Peru. \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n\fMoatize Mine, Mozambique \n\nFirstly, we would like to reiterate that Vale is in compliance with the Resettlement Plan (Plano \nde Reassentamento) agreed with, and approved by the Mozambican Authorities.  \n\nWith regards to the process of guaranteeing the long-term livelihood of the resettled \ncommunities, Vale develops actions that not only guarantee livelihoods, but also actions that \nimprove the quality of life of these populations. For this end, two sets of actions are in progress: \ni) focuses on maintaining the population's livelihoods and ii) promoting self-employment. \n\nActions to maintain livelihoods: \n\n  Annual  support  to  the  agricultural  campaign  providing  improved  seeds  and  technical \n\nsupport for the development of more efficient production practices; \n\n  Encouragement of fruit trees plantation to contribute for a more diversified diet. \n\nActions to promote self-employment (Income Generation) \n\n  Poultry  Project:  Training  poultry  farmers  how  to  improve  their  chicken  production.  The \nbeneficiaries  received  the  initial  inputs  and  support  for  the  construction  of  aviaries. \nCurrently  the  group  has  founded  an  association  and  produces  the  feed  with  its  own \nmeans. \nIncome Culture Project: with emphasis on the production of peanut and sesame, products \nwith a high degree of commercialization in the region; \n\n \n\n  Horticulture Project: production of diversified vegetables that focuses on the local market \nin need of these products (in addition to improving the local community´s nutrition); \n  Production of soap: reusing cooking oil discarded in the preparation of meals for workers \n\nat the mine; \n\n  Production of footwear, carpets, bicycle pedals, among other articles: based on the re-\n\nuse of rubber discarded conveyor belts. \n\nITEM \n\nPROJECT \n\nNº \n\n1 \n\nMaintenance of \nlivelihoods \n\n• Annual support to the agricultural campaign \n\n8.tons in 2017 – 712 \nBeneficiaries \n\n• Technical support for planting \n\n330 Beneficiaries \n\n• Stimulation of fruit trees plantation \n\n15 Beneficiaries \n\nITEM \n\nPROJECT \n\nNº \n\n• Poultry farming \n\n282 Beneficiaries \n\n• Cateme's Feed Mill Project \n\n184 members \n\n• Horticulture \n\n140 Beneficiaries \n\n2 \n\nIncome Generation \nProjects \n\n• Income Cultures \n\n176 Beneficiaries \n\n• Shango Project \n\n01 Beneficiaries \n\n• Cateme Soap Production Project \n\n04 Beneficiaries \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe social programs carried out by Vale are offered to all families resettled and they are released \nwith  the  support  of  community  leaders  and  Cateme  Community  Radio.  We  emphasize  that \nmembership \nin  consideration.  \nFamilies can enter more than one program, just as there are families that do not yet belong to \nincome generation projects, opting to participate only in the maintenance of livelihoods. \n\nthe  vocation  of  candidates \n\nis  voluntary  and \n\ntaken \n\nis \n\nIt´s important to consider that all income generation projects are a challenge for both the company \nand the families. Turning these individuals into entrepreneurs is a medium- and long-term process \nand  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  long-term  perspective  to  achieve  this  transformation.  \nCurrently, about 70% of the resettled families are enrolled in at least one program offered, which \nconstitutes a significant number.  \n\nIn relation to job security and health, Vale has as one of its main values \"life matters most\", \n\ntherefore, prioritizes and implements in a routine and coordinated way, actions that aim to \n\npromote and preserve health and ensure the safety of workers, acting in three main areas: \n\nOccupational hygiene, focusing on: \n\n  Anticipation and identification of existing risk factors in each work area; \n\n  Assessment of risks and level of exposure of employees; \n\n \n\nImplementation and monitoring of disposal and control measures (determining the \n\nspecific type of PPE that must be used for each type of environmental agent); \n\n  Periodic monitoring and evaluation of the program. \n\nOccupational health, focusing on: \n\n  Conduct pre-occupational medical examinations to assess the health profile of the \n\ncandidate and thus determine if the candidate is fit to perform the function for which he \n\nis being hired; \n\n  Conduct periodic medical examinations (semiannual and annual) to assess the health \n\nstatus of the worker and to identify early any health problem; \n\n \n\nImplementation of health promotion activities, carrying out health and safety tool box \n\ntalk in the different work fronts, with the aim of raising awareness among workers in the \n\nadoption of good practices for the preservation of their health. \n\n \n\nImplementation of the quality of life program, which aims to monitor and monitor all \n\nworkers who have a chronic illness; \n\n  Providing a fully equipped clinic, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with professionals \n\nqualified to provide quality health services in a timely manner. \n\n  Provides to all employees with a robust Health Plan that allows him and his \n\ndependents, a differentiated and personalized service in accredited clinics, as well as, \n\nin emergencies, air evacuation in and out of the country for better diagnosis and \n\ntreatment. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fAnd in Occupational Safety, several actions are carried out: \n\n  An Induction program for all new employees including contractor employees’ main focus \n\non matters related to health, safety and environment; \n\n  A safety video for new employees and visitors to our site; \n\n  All activities at Moatize Coal Mine do only initiate after risk assessment is conducted \n\nand/or when all steps of the existing procedure is being followed; \n\n  Vale provides training sessions as well as capacity building to its employees with focus \n\non operational procedures and safety related matters which are provided to all \n\nsupervision areas; Vale possess a training center on site (Educação Valer) with aim to \n\neducate and training its employees and this goes under according to our value “Improve \n\nTogether”; \n\n  All employees are issued with personal protective equipment for their activities, as well \n\nas they are provided with all tools to perform safely their tasks; \n\n  To manage and prevent fatigue, the Operation of Vale Moatize revised and changed the \n\nshift and a new shift was implemented that provides less fatigue and is safer to \n\nemployees; \n\n  There is available on Moatize site an emergency center with a rescue team \n\n(paramedics and fire fighters) always ready for an emergency 24 hours a day and 7 \n\ndays a week; \n\n  A leading indicator for leadership (Vale and Contractors): safety inspections and \n\nbehavioral dialogue for leaders with aim to create more interaction of the leaders with \n\nthe activities in the working fronts and arise more consciousness regarding hazards and \n\nrisks; \n\n  A procedure for identification, communication and investigation of safety related \n\nincidents (accidents and near-miss) and the objective is organizational learning and \n\nimprovement of our processes in terms of safety; \n\n  Celebrated in Moatize Coal Mine a new transport contract that is providing more \n\ncomfort to employees during the travelling from home to work and vice-versa. \n\nIn addition, and to improve the health and safety conditions of workers, direct and indirect, \n\nalso made available: \n\n  Canteen with air-conditioner where breakfasts, lunches and dinners are distributed to \n\nworkers in a regular daily basis. \n\n  Provided drinking water, lighting, ventilation, bathroom in the workplace. \n\nPlease recall that for Vale production never overlap our value \"Life matters most\". \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fRio Colorado Mine, Argentina \n\n As  part  of  the  procedure  for  obtaining  the  environmental  approval  and  due  to  stakeholders \nconcerns on salt (NaCl) contamination risks, the company undertook a series of assessments for \nthe final location of the Salt Storage Facility (SSF). The site for the SSF was selected taking into \naccount  natural  and  social  conditions  of  each  proposed  site.  After  a  careful  consideration  the \nchosen site was located approximately 18 km from the Colorado River (Rio Colorado).  A specific \nSocial and Environmental Report was submitted in 2007 and was approved in August 14 2009 by \na  Resolution  from  the  environmental  and  mining  authorities  after  evaluation  by  the  University \n(Universidad Tecnológica Nacional - Regional San Rafael) and 13 specialized organisms (public \nand  NGOs)  appointed  by  the  Mendoza  Province.      Additionally,  as  part  of  the  environmental \nmanagement program developed, an early alert system was designed for monitoring underground \nwater quality and surface water - including the Colorado River. Vale started the construction in \n2011 but in March 2013, the construction of the Project was suspended. There was no production \nof NaCl. \n\nCarajás Railroad, Brazil \n\nVale  seeks  to  maintain  a  respectful  relationship  and  carry  out  actions  that  avoid,  mitigate  or \ncompensate possible impacts of its operations on these populations. Therefore, it has stablished \nAgreements with the Awá and other indigenous peoples which live  in the influence area of the \nCarajás  Railroad,  either  through  Funai,  third  party  partners  or  directly  with  indigenous \nassociations. \n\nVale  maintains  a  Cooperation  Agreement  to  support  the  Awá,  Guajajara  and  Urubu  Ka'apor \npeoples who inhabit the Caru, Awá and Alto Turiaçu Indigenous Lands and include productive \nactivities focused on the ethno development of these populations.  \n\nVale has agreements with indigenous peoples for more than 30 years. In 1982, Vale signed an \nagreement with Funai to collaborate with the processes of territorial demarcation in the region, \nwhich represented the priority of the indigenous peoples. In relation to the Awá Indigenous Land, \nlocated  35  km  from  the  Carajás  Railroad,  included  in  this  initial  support,  legal  third  parties, \ncontrary to indigenous rights, filed challenges. This generated a long and difficult process until its \nfinal homologation in 2005. During this period, Vale remained with the Awá in their struggle for \nthe territory, including financial support for the demarcation process with Funai, which guaranteed \nthe 116,582 hectares of its Indigenous Land. \n\nAs for the expansion of the Carajás Railroad, we clarified that the duplication works of the railroad \noccurred strictly within the existing domain range. In fact, what is being done is the interconnection \nof existing maneuvering yards. \n\nIt should be noted that the Carajás Railroad does not cut any indigenous lands in Maranhão and \nthat the Awá villages closest to the railroad are Awá and Tiracambú, distant about 1,100m and \n1,700 meters from the railroad, respectively. Additionally, it should be clarified that these people \nare semi-nomadic and, as seen, has been moving beyond the limits of the Awá Indigenous Land, \nfurther away 35 km from the railroad. \n\nRegarding  the  licensing  process  for  the  expansion  of  the  Carajás  Railway,  the  indigenous \ncommunities  are  previously  and  permanently  informed  and  systematically  consulted  about  the \nvarious aspects of the project and consulted on the procedures to be  adopted in the licensing \nprocess  with  the  government  bodies  -  Ibama  and  Funai.  This  dialogue  is  carried  out  by  a \nmultidisciplinary  team  with  experience  in  the  relationship  with  Indigenous  Peoples  that \npermanently make visits, meetings and workshops to these communities, accompanied by the \nFront  of  Ethnographic  Protection  of  Funai.  The  studies  are  conducted  by  experienced  and \nindependent anthropologists and faithfully follow Funai's guidelines. They identified each of the \n\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fimpacts  of  the  expansion  of  the  railroad  on  indigenous  communities,  as  well  as  suggested \nmitigation measures, contributing to the preservation of their physical and cultural integrity. The \nindigenous perspective is prioritized in this process and and their consent is needed. \n\nThe works for the expansion of the railroad were only started after the conclusion and approval \nof the Study of the Indigenous Component -  a study that is carried out with the direct participation \nof the indigenous people –  by Funai.  Also, and necessarily with the participation of the Awá-\nGuajá Indigenous People, the Basic Environmental Plan is being implemented with the relevant \nmitigating measures, all in compliance with Brazilian legislation and considering the perspective \nof ILO Convention 169. \n\nThe  dialogue  is  permanent  and  other  initiatives  have  been  made  possible  in  addition  to  the \nCooperation  Agreement  and  environmental  licensing  process.  For  example,  support  for  the \nconstruction and equipping of 3 Basic Health Units in partnership with the DSEI-MA (Maranhão \nSpecial  Indigenous  Sanitary  District)  and  the  BNDES,  which  were  installed  in  2  Awá  and  1 \nGuajajara villages of Caru Indigenous Land. \n\nVale believes in supporting ethno development of Indigenous Peoples and in long-term, respectful \nand mutually beneficial relationships.  \n\nSamarco Mineração, Fundão Dam, Brazil \n\nThe Samarco accident was a terrible, dramatic and unprecedented event in 73 years of Vale’s \nexistence,  operation  and  the  operation  of  controlled  and  affiliated  companies.  Vale  and  BHP \nBilliton  own  50%  each  of  Samarco  shares.  Vale  has  always  emphasized  to  Samarco  the \nimportance  of  implementing  policies  and  standards  in  line  with  its  own  and  has  supported \nSamarco in its efforts to address the damages caused by the accident. Moreover, from the first \nday of the accident, Vale and its employees have been committed with the emergency response \nand,  right  after,  with  the  human  rights  remediation  and  environmental  recovery,  supporting \nSamarco  and  Renova  Foundation  in  all  areas  needed  and  guaranteeing  the  funding  and \nimplementation of the 41 programs that were established on the agreement with the federal and \nstate governments, together with BHP Billiton. \n\nSamarco’s Accident: \n\nOn the 5th of November 2015, Fundão dam failed and part of the tailings reached Santarém Dam, \nwhich was used to storing water, provoking a partial erosion on the right shoulder of the dam. The \nmaterial reached Gualaxo do Norte river nearby, travelled along its bed, then flowed into the Doce \nriver, reaching the sea in Espírito Santo State on November 22nd, 2015. \n\nThe main impacts were: \n\n  18 fatalities and 1 missed person, presumed dead \n  Around 2,200 hectares impacted along 650 kilometers of the river \n  Temporary suspension of water supply in 16 locations \n \n  Approximately  300  rural  producers  impacted.  Some  of  them  also  had  their  production \n\nImpact on public and private infrastructure, including 3 communities to be relocated \n\ncapacity impacted \n\n  Around 7,500 fishermen impacted due to a ban of fishing activities \n\nThe shareholders of Samarco, BHP Billiton and Vale, provided immediate support to Samarco to \nimplement emergency rescue and relief actions for victims and, subsequently, social remediation \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fand environmental recovery programs. The three companies immediately launched a series of \nsocial, environmental and economic remediation and mitigation actions.  \n\nAn agreement with federal and state authorities was established facilitating the coordination and \nbetter efficiency of the remediation measures. \n\nThe main aspects it encompasses: \n\n  Reparation of the environment and of the communities impacted \n  Environmental compensation where reparation is not possible, such as:  \n\no  Project for basic sanitation for the regions impacted  \no  Reconstruction of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo \n\n  Creation  of  the  Renova  Foundation  to  manage  the  socioenvironmental  and  socio \n\n \n\n \n\neconomic programs \nImplementation  deadline  of  15  years,  renewable  until  all  the  programs  have  been \nimplemented \n Establishment  of  advisory  committees  with  the  participation  of  technical  specialists, \nregulators and representatives of the communities \n\n  R$ 4.4 bi in the first three years (2016-2018) to guarantee the progress of the reparation \n\nand compensation actions, while the projects are being detailed \n\n  R$ 0.8-1.6 bi per year from 2019 to 2021, the value will be defined based on approved \n\nprojects \n\n  R$  240  million  per  year  over  15  years  (since  the  signature  of  the  agreement)  for  the \n\nexecution of the compensation projects \n\n  Additional payment of 500 million to fund sanitation initiatives from 2016 to 2018 \nIn case that Samarco has no resources, Vale and BHP will fund the amounts due \n \n\nPlease, access the attached documents for detailed information: \n\n  Samarco’s Report - 1 Year since the Accident – with the emergency actions and start \nthe  agreement.  http://samarco.com/wp-\n\nthe  41  programs  defined \n\nof \ncontent/uploads/2017/01/Book-Samarco_Ingles_v1.pdf  \n\nin \n\n  Renova  Foundation  Report  -  for  the  better  understanding  of  the  governance  of  the \nremediation and recovery process and a thorough account on all that has been done so \nfar and all that it will still to be completed in the mid-term and the next 10 to 20 years. \nhttp://www.fundacaorenova.org/en/activity-report/about-the-report/ \n\n After the accident, a Dam Department was created to assess and improve the dam management \nprocesses at Vale, generating action plans and targets. All Vale dams received both internal and \nexternal  auditing  and  some  action  plans  have  been  implemented  to  increase  our  level  of \noperational  efficiency and  security.  All  Vale dams surpass the security  level of any national or \ninternational legislation. The company also reviewed its emergency plans, including community \nengagement and community mobilization in case of an accident.  In the 2016 strategic planning \ncycle,  Vale  proposed  a  new  guideline  to  maximize  iron  ore  production  with  natural  moisture, \nreducing tailings generation, optimizing material disposal, separating the slurry from thick tailings \nand using pits to dispose of the slurry. This new plan estimates a 600 million metric-ton reduction \nof  generated  iron  ore  tailings  by  2030,  which  means  a  32%  reduction  compared  to  previous \nproduction  plans.  In  2016,  the  iron  ore  production  was  60%  moist  beneficiation  and  40%  with \nnatural moisture. The beneficiation process is expected to be reversed in the coming years, and \nmay reach 70% beneficiation with natural moisture. \n\nMeanwhile  Vale  has  boosted  its  Risk  Management.  Nowadays  Vale  has  an  integrated  Risk \napproach for all types of risk, encompassing business and processes risk.  \n\n7 \n\n \n \n \n\fThe Samarco accident was a terrible event, nevertheless, it has increased our understanding of \nrisks and impacts. New technology is being developed and implemented in various areas. As an \nexample, Vale is implementing a pilot project on an industrial scale with the objective of studying \nand developing new tailings disposal technologies, aimed at seeking disposal alternatives beyond \ndams or drainage piles.   \n\nVale reiterates that it will continue to support Samarco in all that is necessary to minimize victims' \npain and environmental damage, and that we will do all we can to establish the highest safety \nstandards in the mining industry. \n\nAll  remediation  and  recovery  actions  adopted  by  Samarco  and  now,  Renova  Foundation,  are \naligned  with  national  and  international  standards  and  best  practices  and  the  companies’ \ncommitment with Global Compact 10 Principles.  \n\nMina do Pico, Brazil \n\nIn February of 2015, the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MTE) supervised the Pico Mine \n(MG), specifically the Ouro Verde company, that provides to Vale transportation services for \nfinished products.  \n\nBecause of alleged irregular outsourcing, as well as the submission of workers to the condition \nanalogous to slavery, the ministry filed infringement proceedings against Vale.  These tax \nassessments were all challenged by Vale. The classification of these irregularities as “labour \nanalogous to slavery” is not appropriate, since all of Ouro Verde’s employees were properly \nregistered, with working papers signed and wages paid, operating air-conditioned trucks to \nprotect them from the dust and heat, and transporting them to their homes every day in safe \nand adequate transportation.  \n\nVale repudiates any and all forms of disrespect for human rights and did everything in its power \nto remedy the situation and ensure that it does not recur in its projects and operations.  \n\nAt the time of the inspection, the contractor was formally and immediately notified by Vale to \nprovide improvements at the construction site and to remedy the irregularities. The work activity \nwas paralyzed and resumed three days later. In July, Vale entered into an agreement with the \nFederal Labour Prosecutor’s Office, reinforcing its commitment to the compliance with \nstandards applicable to the working environment of its employees and collaborators. Ouro \nVerde entered into the same agreement.  \n\nIn 2016 Vale contracted an external company to provide a detailed diagnosis in all of Vale’s \nunits in Minas Gerais, verifying the physical conditions of installations and issues related to the \navailability of basic hygiene and drinking water, as well as the legal aspects of Sanitary \nConditions and Comfort in the Workplace, regulated by the Labour Ministry. The result of this \ndiagnosis was registered in the Federal Labour Prosecutor’s Office, and can be broadly and \nfreely consulted by stakeholders.  \n\nThe actions established in the agreement with the Labour Ministry have been fulfilled, both by \nVale and Ouro Verde. Internal groups were later structured to identify and carry out continuous \nimprovements in facilities and workplaces. The results and improvements have been monitored \nin the meetings of area leaders. The contract between Vale and Ouro Verde was cancelled and, \nuntil the end, inspections conducted by Vale were intensified.  \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOnça Puma Nickel mine, Brazil \n\nVale clarifies that the Onça Puma Mine in Ourilândia do Norte (PA) is regularly licensed by the \nEnvironment and Sustainability Secretary of the State of Pará (Semas), in compliance with all the \nconditions  established  by  the  environmental  agency  and  the  National  Foundation  of  the \nIndigenous Peoples (Funai). \n\n For years, Vale has been attempting to carry out the actions of the Basic Environmental Plan \n(PBA)  focused  on  socioeconomic  mitigation  programs  within  the  Xikrin  do  Cateté  Indigenous \nLand, but faces an unjustified resistance by the indigenous people, who maintain the company's \ndenial of access. \n\nThe  company  informs  that  it  has  proposed  to  the  MPF  to  pay  for  the  hiring  of  a  technician  to \naccompany, with the Xikrin, the execution of the PBA, but Vale has not yet been informed of the \nindication of the technician by the federal prosecutors. The company clarifies that it has already \npresented  technical  studies,  demonstrating  that  the  activities  in  Onça  Puma  do  not  generate \npollution of the  Cateté river, and  the  City  of Redenção judge denied the Xikrin request for the \nrelease  of  the  resources  due  to  the  lack  of  evidence  of  their  argument  and  has  determined  a \njudicial inspection to verify the condition of the Xikrin’s tribes and the Cateté river.

To achieve this, we are committed to applying international human rights \nstandards across our operations as well as our value chain.  \n\nAs such, we have integrated the UN Framework and Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \ninto the policies that guide the behaviour of our 323,000 employees worldwide and of our business \npartners. We have in place a group-wide Human Rights Due Diligence Programme we implement in \nclose collaboration with selected expert partners.  \n\nAs part of this Programme, since 2011 we have trained more than 96,000 Nestlé employees around \nthe world, carried out 13 Human Rights Impact Assessment in high-risk countries, as well as revised \nour audit and monitoring systems to integrate strengthened human rights requirements. We report \nannually  on  our  performance  in  our  Nestlé  in  Society  report,  using  the  GRI  Standards  and  the  UN \nGuiding Principles Reporting Framework in addition to our own commitments.  \n\nWe  also  work  alongside  others  to  address  specific  human  rights  issues  with  direct  and  upstream \nsuppliers. The challenges involved in addressing human rights in agricultural supply chains are often \nsystemic and complex. We cannot tackle these alone, and so work in collaboration with key partners \nto identify challenges and solutions aligned with supporting the Sustainable Development Goals.  \n\nWe  address  the  issues  flagged  in  the  report  below.  Our  Nestlé  in  Society  report  provides  a \ncomprehensive overview of our actions on the ground in this area. \n\nChild labour in our cocoa supply chain \nWe are opposed to all forms of child exploitation and we have publically committed to preventing and \naddressing child labour wherever it occurs in our supply chain.  \n\nWe  are  tackling  this  complex  and  challenging  issue  in  the  cocoa  sector  through  our  Child  Labour \nMonitoring and Remediation System (CLMRS) in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, in collaboration with the \nInternational Cocoa Initiative. Between 2013 and 2015, we have seen a reduction in child labour of \n51% in farmers’ cooperatives where the system was set up. In 2017, more than 280 000 farmers and \ncommunity  members  attended  awareness  training  on  child  labour  and  more  than  11 000  children \nbenefitted from remediation activities.  \n\nThe Fair Labour Association (FLA) audits our cocoa supply chain annually and reports are published on \nits website, together with our corrective action plans.  \n\nWhile we continue to take action in our own supply chains, we recognise that the scale of the challenge \nrequires collective action. Within the framework of the initiative CocoaAction, we are working with the \nbroader cocoa and chocolate industry to address it. We are pleased to see that more companies have \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fnow  set  up  a  dedicated  CLMRS  in  their  own  supply  chain  and  that  the  certification  body  UTZ  has \nintegrated  specific  requirement  on  child  labour  monitoring  in  their  cocoa  protocol,  contributing  to \nimproving the situation across the entire sector.   \n\nForced labor in fish & seafood in Thailand \nUnfair recruitment practices leading to poor labor conditions have been identified as one of the most \nsignificant challenges within the fish and seafood supply chain, particular in Thailand’s fishing industry.  \n\nFor that reason, we collaborated with Verité to conduct an assessment of these practices and labor \nconditions more broadly in our Thai seafood supply chain in 2015. Out of that study, we developed our \nThailand Action Plan for the Responsible Sourcing of Seafood.  \n\nAs part of this action plan, we are working with our Thai seafood suppliers on responsible recruitment. \nThese suppliers have mapped the recruitment fees that their workers pay and they are now covering \nthese costs as they are discovered. Considering the complexity of the recruitment networks, it takes \ntime to discover the full extent of fees that workers have paid. Tackling this issue in an ongoing effort \nand we fully support our suppliers in leading the way to transform practices in the industry.  \n\nIn parallel, we are partnering with third parties that conduct research in sourcing countries and deploy \nworker voice tools and trainings to get a complete picture of recruitment conditions while also raising \nawareness among workers of their rights:  \n\n  We  partner  with  Issara  to  build  access  to  grievance  mechanisms  and  worker  voice  systems \nthroughout the entirety of our Thai seafood supply chains. By the end of 2017, over 35,000 workers \nin Nestlé’s supply chain (including at  processing sites, feed mills, fishmeal plants,  and on fishing \nvessels) had access to Issara’s independent helpline and can seek assistance and support. Since our \npartnership with Issara began in March 2016, Issara’s Inclusive Labour Monitoring system has been \nimplemented  in  60%  of  Nestlé  petcare’s  Tier  1  supplier  sites,  50%  of  feed  mills,  and  100%  of \nfishmeal plants  in Thailand. Issara is now engaging with vessel owners and boat  captains in our \nsupply chains. \n\n  We  also  partner  with  Verité  to  develop  and  roll  out  responsible  recruitment  trainings  to  vessel \n\nowners, captains, and workers. \n\nHowever, transformative change within the supply chain requires an industry effort, therefore:  \n\n  Through  the  Thai  Seafood  Taskforce,  we  became  a  member  of  the  Responsible  Recruitment \nsubgroup, working to build demand for ethical recruitment practices throughout Taskforce member \nsupply chains.   \n\n  In 2017 we joined the Responsible Labor Initiative, part of the Responsible Business Alliance, with \nthe ambition of working to apply their responsible recruitment tools in our food supply chains. \n  This year, we became a member of the Institute for Human Rights and Business’s Leadership Group \nfor Responsible Recruitment to advocate for and collaborate with industry around the Employer \nPays Principle.  \n\nWe have made significant progress in implementing our action plan and we will continue to provide \npublic updates on our progress on our dedicated webpage. \n\nLand acquisition in our palm oil supply chain in Indonesia \nWe are against all forms of land acquisitions that are illegal or that have an adverse impact on local \ncommunities’ livelihoods. We have committed to develop our business in a way that complies with the \ncustomary  rights  to  land  and  natural  resources  of  indigenous  peoples  and  communities  that  are \nimpacted  or  potentially  impacted  by  our  business  activities.  In  addition,  the  Nestlé  Responsible \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSourcing Standard makes  explicit  provisions  for  preventing  social  conflict  arising  from  potential \ndisputes over land rights and land acquisition. \n\nIn order to address potential challenges linked to this issue, we are working with the NGO The Forest \nTrust (TFT) and multiple suppliers sourcing in Aceh Tamiang, Indonesia, to address deforestation at a \nlandscape level. The programme aims to support and contribute to the government’s land use planning \nprocess, with the intention of creating resilient and thriving ecosystems and communities through a \nunified push towards transformation.  \n\nWe recently announced our accelerated plan towards reaching the company’s 2020 No Deforestation \ncommitment  by  becoming  the  first  global  food  company  to  implement  Starling,  a  satellite-based \nservice, to monitor 100% of its global palm oil supply chains. Starling was developed by Airbus and The \nForest  Trust  (TFT)  as  a  global  verification  system  evidencing  that  no  deforestation  is  taking  place \nthroughout the supply chain. \n\nWe are also working with TFT on a smallholder initiative under their Rurality programme in Indonesia \nto build smallholder inclusion in our palm oil supply chain, while developing smallholders’ resilience \nand their capability to produce responsibly. \n\nIn 2017, TFT and the Danish Institute for Human Rights released the outcomes and action plans of the \nlabour right assessment that we conducted together with one of our main suppliers in the palm oil \nsector.   \n\nSecurity of trade union members in Colombia \nUnfortunately, violence has been widespread in Colombia for many years. The region where Nestlé’s \nBugalagrande factory is located has levels of criminality and violence that are significantly higher than \nthe  national  average.  This  situation  has  affected  trade  union  leaders,  members  of  our  local \nmanagement team, all employees, their relatives, and the Bugalagrande community at large.  \n\nWe have consistently strongly denounced all acts of violence and intimidation against our employees \nin Colombia and their community. We have expressed this, both publicly to the authorities and in direct \nmeetings with the local trade union Sinaltrainal.  \n\nFor several years, we have had a standard protocol agreed with Sinaltrainal for threats and security \nconcerns in general. Any measures, including delivering security support (financial assistance, police \nprotection, relocation, etc.) are taken in accordance with the agreed protocol and closely followed up \non by Nestlé Colombia and Sinaltrainal during their regular meetings. \n\n3"}

Nous \nvoudrions profiter de cette occasion pour exprimer nos préoccupations quant à la qualité de \nce Dossier en raison de ses inexactitudes factuelles au sujet de Glencore et de notre filiale \nKamoto Copper Company (KCC) en République démocratique du Congo (RDC).  \n\nNous regrettons que Pain pour le prochain (PPP) n’ait pas communiqué avec Glencore ou \nKCC sur ce Dossier avant sa publication. Nous notons néanmoins positivement que PPP \nreconnaît les progrès accomplis par Glencore et KCC en mettant en œuvre des actions \néducatives, en soutenant des coopératives agricoles et en apportant des améliorations dans \nle domaine des soins de santé. \n\nGestion de l’eau \nPPP soutient dans ce Dossier que Glencore a « promis de fournir aux habitants de Musonoi \nune meilleure infrastructure d’approvisionnement en eau d’ici à fin 2017, mais qu’en dehors \nde la construction par KCC de trois stations hydrauliques de l’autre côté de sa concession \nrien n’a été fait ». C’est matériellement inexact : KCC ne s’est jamais engagé à fournir de \nl’eau à la localité de Musonoi dans ces délais.  \n\nAu début de cette année, nous avons expliqué à PPP que la localité de Musonoi avait \ndemandé à KCC de réhabiliter deux puits construits à l’origine par Gécamines. La localité de \nMusonoi reconnaît que ces deux puits constituent les seules solutions viables permettant \nd’assurer l’accès à l’eau dans le court à moyen terme. À ce jour, plusieurs réunions ont eu \nlieu entre KCC et Gécamines afin d’évaluer la situation et élaborer une solution possible. \n\nNous avons communiqué à de nombreuses reprises avec PPP pour répondre à son allégation \nselon laquelle, entre 2012 et 2014, des métaux lourds auraient été rejetés dans la rivière \nLuilu suite aux activités de KCC. À ce jour, on ne sait toujours pas sur quelles preuves repose \ncette allégation. En effet, KCC n’est pas la seule entreprise rejetant de l’eau dans la rivière \nLuilu. Qui plus est, PPP a refusé de présenter les résultats de son analyse d’eau.  \n\nKCC a réalisé des investissements substantiels pour résoudre les problèmes d’eau hérités du \nlong passé de son complexe minier. Datant de plus de 50 ans, celui-ci a été mal entretenu \npar les opérateurs précédents. Pendant de nombreuses années, avant l’investissement de \n\nGlencore plc \nBaarermattstrasse 3, P.O. Box, CH-6341 Baar, Switzerland \nT +41 41 709 20 00  F +41 41 709 30 00 www.glencore.com \nRegistered in Jersey with number 107710 \nRegistered address: Queensway House, Hilgrove Street, St Helier, Jersey JE1 1ES \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fGlencore dans KCC, les opérateurs précédents de KCC ont rejeté des eaux résiduelles sans \ntraitement. Les effluents ont été déversés sans restriction dans l’eau de surface locale. \nDepuis 2009, KCC a investi plus de 40 millions de dollars dans la pose de plus de 20 km \nd’infrastructures de canalisation, une usine de neutralisation par la chaux naturelle, un \nsystème d’élimination des résidus, des pompes spécialisées et des usines de traitement \nd’eau. Le complexe traite désormais l’intégralité de ses effluents avant de les rejeter.  \n\nEn RDC, la législation sur l’eau réglemente le contrôle de celle-ci. KCC contrôle l’eau \nquotidiennement, mensuellement et trimestriellement par le biais de points de prélèvement \nà l’intérieur et à l’extérieur de sa concession ainsi que sur plusieurs sites de surveillance de la \nrivière Luilu. Conformément aux bonnes pratiques internationales en matière d’exploitation \nminière, la totalité des eaux résiduelles de KCC est décantée avant rejet. \n\nKCC soumet au Ministère des mines un rapport annuel sur sa gestion de l’eau et accueille \ndes inspecteurs du gouvernement pour qu’ils procèdent régulièrement à des prélèvements.  \n\nDossier évoque un incident lors duquel Musonoi a été « envahi par la boue » fin 2017. Il \ns’agissait d’une conséquence directe de fortes pluies, sans lien avec les activités de KCC. \nNéanmoins, KCC a ensuite nettoyé les trois principaux égouts aux abords de la route de \nMusonoi afin de réduire les risques avant la prochaine saison des pluies. À la connaissance \nde KCC, la localité n’a pas subi de dommages durables. \n\nDossier évoque par ailleurs une prétendue fuite de la mine ayant pollué le sol et les jardins \nde plus de 400 foyers de Luilu au début de cette année. Au moment de l’incident, KCC a \nexpliqué à la localité affectée que la fuite ne provenait pas de la mine et qu’en raison des \nfortes pluies l’entreprise n’était pas en mesure d’évaluer totalement l’impact sur les \nrécoltes. KCC a choisi d’adopter une approche préventive positive en apportant aux \npersonnes affectées une assistance financière et en les incitant à participer au programme \nde développement communautaire de KCC. Les autorités de la RDC ont finalement identifié \ndix familles touchées par cette fuite. Plus de 460 agriculteurs ont néanmoins reçu une \nassistance financière accordée bénévolement par KCC. Par ailleurs, les agriculteurs ont \nconstitué cinq coopératives agricoles soutenues par le programme de développement \ncommunautaire de KCC.  \n\nLutte contre la poussière \nDossier donne à penser que Glencore « refuse » d’asphalter les rues. C’est une présentation \ntrompeuse. KCC s’acquitte d’une taxe routière auprès du gouvernement de la RDC \nspécifiquement destinée à cet effet. En outre, KCC soutient le gouvernement provincial dans \nune initiative d’infrastructure plus vaste visant à mettre en place une route de \ncontournement destinée à réduire le fort trafic routier à travers la ville de Kolwezi et les \nlocalités avoisinantes.  \n\nOn ne comprend pas bien sur quelle base factuelle PPP affirme que les activités de KCC sont \nmassivement responsables de l’exposition à la poussière de Musonoi. Outre KCC, Sicomines \net Commus exploitent des mines dans la zone située autour de cette localité. Par ailleurs, la \nroute de Musonoi est publique et très utilisée par des usagers non liés aux mines. \n\nEn fait, KCC est la principale entreprise prenant effectivement des mesures qui visent à \natténuer la pollution par la poussière en entretenant la route et en luttant contre la \npoussière par arrosage et utilisation de produits spécifiques. KCC a également planté une \nrangée d’arbres devant la localité de Musonoi afin de la protéger de la poussière. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fÉlaborer et mettre en œuvre des solutions pérennes afin d’améliorer les infrastructures liées \nà l’eau et de rénover les routes exige une approche multipartite impliquant le gouvernement \nrégional, les entreprises du voisinage et les agences nationales. PPP semble attribuer cette \nresponsabilité uniquement à Glencore, ce qui est déraisonnable et irréaliste. Nous \nregrettons également le commentaire de PPP qui, tout en reconnaissant que Glencore \nconstruit bel et bien des écoles, soutient des coopératives et améliore les soins de santé, \naffirme que nous ne nous attaquons pas aux préoccupations réelles de la population. Ce \ncommentaire est inexact et n’est pas corroboré par nos relations avec les collectivités. \n\nCréation d’avantages socio-économiques \nNous en profitons pour souligner les avantages socio-économiques que nos entreprises \ncréent au sein de la RDC. Nous apportons des contributions significatives à l’économie de la \nRDC tant au plan national que local. Nous sommes résolus à appliquer des normes élevées \nen matière de gouvernance d’entreprise et de transparence ainsi que favorables à une \ntransparence accrue en ce qui concerne la redistribution et le réinvestissement des \npaiements effectués au gouvernement.  \n\nNous avons participé activement à l’Initiative pour la transparence dans les industries \nextractives (ITIE) depuis 2011. Chaque année, nous publions un « Rapport des paiements aux \ngouvernements » qui précise notre approche en matière d’impôts et de transparence et \nrecense, pays par pays et projet par projet, les paiements effectués pendant l’année. À \ntravers cette approche transparente, nous soutenons une plus forte responsabilité au sein \ndes pays où nous opérons. \n\nNos entreprises en RDC versent chaque année des impôts et des redevances directement \naux autorités du pays. Depuis 2015, le gouvernement de la RDC a perçu plus de 1,1 milliard \nde dollars d’impôts et de redevances. Par ailleurs, nous avons consacré plus de 1,5 milliard \nde dollars à des dépenses d’investissement en RDC. À l’avenir, nous prévoyons que notre \ncontribution économique et les paiements au gouvernement de la RDC seront sensiblement \nplus élevés en raison de la reprise de la production de cuivre chez KCC en décembre 2017, \nsuite à un investissement majeur opéré sur 18 mois en vue de transformer ses installations \nde traitement. \n\nEn 2017, nos entreprises ont employé plus de 22 000 personnes en RDC et versé 67 millions \nde dollars de salaires. Par ailleurs, elles mettent des structures sanitaires de haut niveau à la \ndisposition de leurs employés et des personnes à leur charge. Certaines accueillent \négalement d’autres habitants de la région. Nous soutenons les campagnes de vaccination \ncontre la poliomyélite et la rougeole pour plus de 30 000 enfants dans les collectivités \nlocales.  \n\nNous proposons des tests VIH/sida à nos employés et à leurs familles. Nous soutenons \négalement le programme national de lutte contre le VIH/sida de la RDC à travers un \nprogramme de formation de pairs éducateurs au sein des collectivités locales, ainsi qu’à \ntravers des campagnes de sensibilisation auprès de ces dernières et de groupes à haut \nrisque, tels que les conducteurs de camions. \n\nNous avons mis en œuvre un vaste programme de contrôle afin de réduire l’impact du \npaludisme sur nos employés ainsi qu’au sein des collectivités locales. En 2017, quelque \n20 000 foyers ont bénéficié d’une pulvérisation, ce qui a protégé plus de 115 000 personnes. \nPar ailleurs, des moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide ont été proposées aux groupes à \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fhaut risque – femmes enceintes et enfants de moins de cinq ans – et des sessions de \nsensibilisation au paludisme ont été organisées au sein des collectivités. \n\nOutre notre participation à la construction, la remise en état et l’équipement d’écoles \nlocales, nous travaillons avec les ONG et les églises locales à la tenue de camps de vacances \nd’été pour les enfants afin d’éviter qu'ils ne participent à des activités minières artisanales \n(ASM). En 2017, plus de 7200 enfants ont participé à ces camps et une réduction notable du \nnombre d’enfants employés à des activités ASM a pu être constatée.  \n\nNous soutenons les projets de diversification économique gérés par des coopératives locales \nvisant à établir des programmes axés sur des modes de subsistance différents afin de réduire \nla participation à des activités ASM. Ces projets sont centrés sur le développement de \ncompétences dans les domaines de l’agriculture, de la soudure, de la menuiserie et de la \nrestauration. En 2017, ils ont permis de former plus de 4000 personnes en vue de \ndévelopper des activités.  \n\nEn coopération avec le gouvernement, nous nous sommes engagés, à hauteur de \n400 millions de dollars, à contribuer à la modernisation des infrastructures électriques de la \nRDC. Ce projet s’inscrit dans un programme de la Banque mondiale consistant à améliorer le \nréseau à haute tension afin de permettre à la compagnie d’électricité nationale SNEL \nd’élargir l’accès à l’électricité dans des zones non ou mal desservies. Il contribuera à générer \nde la croissance économique et des emplois.  \n\nGlencore favorise le dialogue avec ses parties prenantes et encourage des relations \ntransparentes.  Nous espérons que PPP en tiendra compte à l’avenir. \n\nCordialement, \n\nAnna Krutikov \nResponsable Groupe du Développement durable \n\nCopie à : Chantal Peyer"}

It is important to note that this area is across the river (which is a natural barrier for elephant given its width and depth) and to the best of our knowledge, currently, it is not a distribution area of elephants.\nGrievances associated with the Project are addressed through a transparent and impartial process in line with international best practice such as IFC, United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Right and the IPIECA Community Grievance Mechanisms guide. All grievances are received and registered by the CTLO either directly or by calling them on a tool free line 0800 216 000 (as for today, more than 350 grievances since 2012 have been sorted). These are then investigated with the involvement of various stakeholders including district leaders depending on the grievance. Engagements are regularly conducted by the CTLOs and in addition a number of studies have been conducted."}
